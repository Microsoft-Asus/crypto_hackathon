Attendees will receive exclusive tips from industry professionals and learn how to grow, diversify, and protect their crypto technology portfolios. You’ll get to hear from and network with top bitcoin, altcoin, and blockchain executives and investors. Join us at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York City on June 11th and 12th for two days of enrichment, insight, and growth.\nCharlie Shrem, ex-Vice Chairman Bitcoin Foundation, Ryan Taylor, CEO Dash, Arianna Simpson, early Bitcoin investor, Richard Ells, CEO Electronuem, Ajay Yadav, CEO Roomi, Sean Keegan, CEO Crypto Hedge Fund and many other prominent names in the Bitcoin ecosphere, along with NewYorkCoin, will be presenting to the over 1,500 accredited investors projected to attend the upcoming BCI Summit in New York City.\nNew York Coin (NYC) launched on March 6th, 2014. Original developer disappeared at launch and is still unknown to this date. NY Coin is a fair launch cryptocurrency with no pre-mine and is completely open-source with searchable block explorers. NYC enables a free worldwide money transfer system with lightning fast transactions. Easy low difficulty mining ensures the network remains free to use without the need for specialized high-cost mining equipment. Proven blockchain since 2014 and a very pro-active development team that is attracting talent from Fortune 100 Companies.\nNYC is a basic money transfer system. No frills, no whitepaper, just the bare essentials that Bitcoin and Litecoin offer. Worldwide, anonymous transfer of funds without using a Central Bank or Authority. NYC just does this faster and cheaper. NYC is lightning fast – test it! Unconfirmed transactions worldwide in just 1-2 seconds. And NYC has been confirming blocks every 30 seconds since 2014. There are no fees to send funds. Zero. NYC offers free, lightning-fast worldwide money transfer. And NYC is actually usable at the retail level. Bitcoin is simply not feasible for time-sensitive daily consumer purchases due to its 10-minute block time. NYC is a more usable version of Bitcoin.

Blockchain shot into the public consciousness last year as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum skyrocketed in value.\nBlockchain is the underpinning of cryptocurrencies, but there’s more to the technology than that. In the near future, it could be used to automate government records, track trillions of dollars in shipped goods and allow a patient record to be accessed from any hospital.\nCompanies like IBM are funneling money into exploring blockchain, universities are dedicating departments to it and states are passing legislation to try and jump-start its development. Cryptocurrencies have fallen off in value as the 2017 hype faded.\nBut setting them aside, here’s what blockchain is, what it can do and how people are using it right now. (Video credit: IBM Think Academy, Youtube) Envisioning the future of blockchain requires understanding how the technology works.\nOn its simplest level, blockchain is a constantly growing list of records linked to each other online.

The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country’s lower courts in a case dating back to last year.\nIn September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.\nAccording to the court, the government could not seize Ahn’s bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren’t tangible.\n“It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,” the court ruled. “Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.”\nNow, the country’s Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court’s decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea’s highest court, it didn’t hold up.\nSeeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it.\n“Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,” the ruling from this Tuesday reads. “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.”\nAhn’s sentence will remain the same, but he’ll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn’s transactions on Bitcoin’s ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.\n“[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,” the court ruling states.\nThe ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After effecting a domestic ban on ICOs in September of last year, the South Korean government has approached the cryptocurrency industry with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday’s ruling and the outlook of a formal framework for token sales, however, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ahn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asset  south korea’s supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suwon district court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T03:39:54.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e12eae291af766bf0d07b1eebc96ec21a76f401b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7g9v4zscTx5k8mKCCVDwdHHBoz9.GGWggKTbAr9xqZUTZPRk46P0gn1_d8.XysjzB4m3HIOIaDY4NBPyk2cXcFjcbBxohPsQf", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Craig Wright says all Cryptos are failure except Bitcoin Cash, Calls Litecoin a Sh*tcoin", "title_full": "Craig Wright says all Cryptos are failure except Bitcoin Cash, Calls Litecoin a Sh*tcoin : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-06-07T03:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.069, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e12eae291af766bf0d07b1eebc96ec21a76f401b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7g9v4zscTx5k8mKCCVDwdHHBoz9.GGWggKTbAr9xqZUTZPRk46P0gn1_d8.XysjzB4m3HIOIaDY4NBPyk2cXcFjcbBxohPsQf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zycrypto", "published": "2018-06-07T03:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Craig Wright says all Cryptos are failure except Bitcoin Cash, Calls Litecoin a Sh*tcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/zycrypto\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://zycrypto.com/craig-wright-says-all-cryptos-are-failure-except-bitcoin-cash-calls-litecoin-a-shtcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T23:46:28.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d145c61bb76e6b0ba059883b17a2512184589f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRaIUXgw3HU4fEOcrrS0uPI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=197.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Service Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "margin - Bitcoin Trading Bot: Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Poloniex, Bitfinex...", "title_full": "margin - Bitcoin Trading Bot: Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Poloniex, Bitfinex...", "published": "2018-06-07T03:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.485, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d145c61bb76e6b0ba059883b17a2512184589f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRaIUXgw3HU4fEOcrrS0uPI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "leonArdo@margin", "published": "2018-06-07T03:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "margin - Bitcoin Trading Bot: Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Poloniex, Bitfinex...", "text": "Quote: from: dbolivar on June 01, 2018, 11:05:48 PM Quote: from: Amaralluis on June 01, 2018, 02:45:04 PM\n...\n(Margin team, can you clarify if the bot takes into consideration the direction of the short EMA, i.e. crossing from above or below?)\n...\nHi Dorian,\nThanks for jumping in.\nYes, the bot knows the direction of the short EMA.

The campaign will comprise a minivan boldly donning the bitcoin logo embarking on a road trip across Argentina and Latin America with the goal of spreading knowledge and fostering bitcoin adoption.\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Drowning in Tokens Latin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign\nNon-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ‘ Bitcoineta ‘ – a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption.\nThe tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America.\nThe project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, “It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.”\nThe two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films. Sowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption\nThe Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba.\nJulian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, “The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.”\nDo you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol.

The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code, ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain.

The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo, Blockpress, and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

If the price is in the trend of $20k.. not close the possibility that there are still many who buy to make investments, trading, and other things. Indeed at this moment.. it's so high when looking at that price, but not forever we are in lowliness and everything may change towards a higher level.\nIf we go to those price smoothly, I will buy bitcoin from that price, why not. This is a progress, the price will go up and people will keep trading, buying and selling. There is no stop in this, it's growing nicely.\n20k dollar is a huge price and we know that the general market rules is to invest in a low market while this is a huge price to get Bitcoin and not easy for a person, furthermore it has high chances of losing money or will take a long time to give you profit.

So in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief we also feature a surefire way to make a quick fortune in cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center How to Make $120,000 in a Week\nAre you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon Ledger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts And speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Before I go into the details of what I have for you today, let me give you a brief introduction about bitcoin for those who are totally ignorant about it. So, What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a digital currency, a cryptocurrency used as a means of payment system introduced in 2009 by a leading developer in the person of Satoshi Nakamoto. It is an open-source software in which the payments in the system are recorded in a public ledger using its own unit of account called bitcoin. There are smaller units of bitcoin just like you have a smaller unit of every currency of the world such as Naira has kobo as one of the smaller units. As an example, Satoshi, named after the developer is one of the smaller units of bitcoin. Transactions with bitcoin work peer-peer without the need for a central repository or a single administrator and this has led the United States Treasury to call bitcoin a decentralized virtual currency. Although its status as a currency is often disputed, as a result, media reports often refer to it as a digital currency or simply cryptocurrency. Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments by a processing called mining, into the public ledger. Individuals or companies can engage in this activity called mining, in exchange for transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides mining, bitcoins can be obtained in exchange for fiat money, products, and services. Users can send and receive bitcoins electronically for an optional transaction fee using wallet software on a personal computer, mobile device, or a web application. Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has seen growth, and merchants have an incentive to accept the digital currency because fees are lower compared to the 2–3% processing fees typically imposed by credit card processors. However, the European Banking Authority has warned that Bitcoin lacks consumer protections because, unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser, not the vendor. Another drawback is that Bitcoins can be stolen and chargebacks are impossible. I think that is one reason why the commercial use of bitcoin is currently small compared to its use by speculators, which has fueled price volatility. Anyway, this is a tutorial on how you can earn free bitcoin from different faucets that are connected to Coinpot account, on a daily basis so you can attain financial freedom in no distant time.

"text": "The cryptocurrency market continued its positive momentum on Thursday, with most major cryptocurrencies trading up more than 2 percent on the day. Here’s a look at some of the headlines that were moving the cryptocurrency market today — and which currencies were on the move.\nHeadlines Cybersecurity firm Carbon Black has reported that $1.1 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen so far in 2018. The firm said the malware used to steal cryptos costs about $224 and makes it surprisingly easy to commit the thefts without any technical skills.\nFollowing an op-ed story in the Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A ) (NYSE: BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon once again ripped bitcoin in an interview with CNBC . Dimon has previously called bitcoin a “fraud” and urged investors to “just beware” on Thursday. Buffett, who recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” said Thursday he has “set a high standard” when it comes to hating bitcoin as an investment.\nVanEck has said it's applying for a third time to get a bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC for trading on a major U.S. market. VanEck’s previous proposals were withdrawn after the SEC raised concerns related to investor safety, and the SEC has yet to approve a single cryptocurrency ETF up to this point.\nPrice Action The Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC ) traded at $12.70, up 2 percent.\nHere’s how several top crypto investments fared Thursday. Prices are as of 3:30 p.m. ET and reflect the previous 24 hours.\nBitcoin gained 2.1 percent to $7,692; Ethereum gained 1.5 percent to $607; Ripple gained 2.6 percent to 68 cents; Bitcoin Cash gained 2.9 percent to $1,144; EOS gained 5.4 percent to $14.30. The three cryptocurrencies with at least $1-million market caps that have made the biggest gains over the past 24 hours are:\nZeitcoin: $4.9-million market cap, 65-percent gain. GoldMint: $2.4-million market cap, 47-percent gain. Elite: $3.2-million market cap, 42.4-percent gain. The three cryptocurrencies hit hardest in the past 24 hours were:\nSteem Dollars: $25.4-million market cap, 75.5-percent decline. Zoin: $9.3-million market cap, 66-percent decline. BunnyCoin: $2.4-million market cap, 47.3-percent decline.

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

The company is hiring employees to build a digital asset exchange and a cryptocurrency custody service.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for great videos featuring industry insiders & experts\nRetail Giant Fidelity Building Cryptocurrency Infrastructure\nFidelity Investments , which has 2.5 trillion in assets under management and over 27 million customers, is seeking a DevOps system engineer “to help engineer, create, and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud,” per Business Insider. Another advertisement is seeking employees to help create “first-in-class custodian services for Bitcoin and other digital currencies.” If confirmed, it would mean that Fidelity’s customers could soon trade cryptocurrencies directly with one of America’s largest brokerage firms.\nAccording to the report, Vanguard have been working on building an in-house crypto exchange for around a year. The maneuver would mean that established exchanges in the U.S. market like Coinbase , Gemini , and Bittrex would face new competition from an established financial industry player with deep pockets.\nFidelity has a long-standing interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The firm allowed employees to pay with bitcoin in the company cafeteria and also accepted donations in bitcoin to a Fidelity charitable fund . They began testing a service last year that allows customers to view their Coinbase account holdings from their Fidelity account. The CEO of Fidelity, Abigail Johnson, also announced at Consensus 2017 that the firm had a small but profitable bitcoin and ether mining operation.\nAt the time, Johnson said that:\n“I’m a believer. I’m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services company that has not given up on digital currencies.”\nFidelity Labs , the firm’s skunkworks division, has been researching blockchain and cryptocurrencies for several years. The unit is looking at blockchain applications for healthcare and announced last spring that they had joined the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts , a blockchain research consortium. Hadley Stern, the Senior Vice President of Fidelity Labs, told CNBC last summer that :\n“Blockchain technology is going to change to the world. For the first time, you can transfer value through software, and software alone. This is a huge change, and bitcoin, ether and litecoin and others are really the first part of this.”\nFinancial Industry Looking to Bring Crypto to the Masses\nWhile Fidelity appears to be taking the lead on its competitors, other American brokerage houses also allow for the trading of some cryptocurrency products. Charles Schwab customers can trade bitcoin futures , as can those with online brokerage E-Trade . Meanwhile, fintech startup Robinhood began allowing cryptocurrency trading in some U.S. states earlier this year.\nFidelity’s pivot to crypto – the latest adoption domino to fall.\nIn the financial industry generally, the acceptance of cryptocurrencies has come slower than that of blockchain. The crypto space is viewed in some quarters with suspicion, though some early detractors have revised their opinion. For example, Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan said last fall that those who invested in bitcoin were “stupid.” But seven months later, his bank reversed course and said it was working on a cryptocurrency business strategy . However, others, like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, remain die-hard skeptics .\nWhat’s your take? Is Fidelity the first of many more mainstream firms to come, or will adoption stay steady for the foreseeable future?

Proposes New Protocols to Decentralize Bitcoin Mining - BitcoinAdsTrain", "text": "\nGet exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nBitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo has published a draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to further decentralize bitcoin mining through the adoption of a new mining protocol.\nPublished by Corallo — perhaps better known by his social media handle TheBlueMatt — on his personal GitHub repository this week, the “ BetterHash Mining Protocol(s) ” seeks to address one of the many “pressures” in bitcoin mining that push the ecosystem toward centralization: Stratum , the most widely-used mining protocol.\nAs Corallo explains, deficiencies in the design of Stratum, combined with the fact that most bitcoin miners point their hashpower toward mining pools, limit the diversity of block templates used across the network. This, he claims, gives pool operators undue influence over network upgrades and reduces Bitcoin’s censorship resistance.\n“Difficult to implement and poorly documented, the design of the Stratum protocol requires pool operators to build and distribute block templates to their clients. Without a diverse body of miners constructing block templates, the network’s censorship resistance is jeopardized (e.g. pool operators may use their position of power to restrict the flow of protocol upgrades).”\nCorallo seeks to replace the Stratum protocol with a new system that divides block construction and payouts into two protocols — Work and Pool — collectively known as BetterHash. This will allow individual miners to select the transactions they include in blocks, rather than letting mining pool operators make that choice for them, while still benefiting from the stable payouts that connecting to a pool provides.\nAt present, miners who want to use their own block templates must either solo mine or connect to small decentralized mining pool p2pool, which increases their autonomy at the cost of being unable to receive stable payouts.\nUnder BetterHash, pool operators would not be able to use their position to tell miners whether to adopt particular network upgrades. Moreover, giving miners more control over block templates also helps mitigate the risk of a government ordering a locally-operated mining pool to censor particular types of transactions.\nNotably, BetterHash does not force miners to construct their own block templates if they do not want to, but it does give them the option to utilize the Work protocol to connect to another pool’s block template — even if they want to direct their hashpower somewhere else.\nIn addition to decreasing centralization within the bitcoin mining ecosystem, BetterHash also introduces some performance improvements over Stratum.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "corallo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt corallo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T07:56:50.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38e0a06f673791a7c08fb994dd001f14d714555b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSKGWYj7gowKiSCXW3cNQXPbxrEGbf5.MqMEkBkvB1D9Rqp0Ayt3wM5MFf3EjyNPAE-", "site_full": "www.mpgh.net", "site": "mpgh.net", "site_section": "https://www.mpgh.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=885", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Currency Exchange - MPGH - MultiPlayer Game Hacking &amp; Cheats - Hacks, Cheats, Downloads, Trainers, Games", "title": "[WTB] Buying Bitcoin for Paypal. 20% RATE", "title_full": "[WTB] Buying Bitcoin for Paypal. 20% RATE - MPGH - MultiPlayer Game Hacking & Cheats", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.09, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38e0a06f673791a7c08fb994dd001f14d714555b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSKGWYj7gowKiSCXW3cNQXPbxrEGbf5.MqMEkBkvB1D9Rqp0Ayt3wM5MFf3EjyNPAE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "_corn_", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "[WTB] Buying Bitcoin for Paypal. 20% RATE", "text": "I sold him $ 70 btс cool dude.

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

The project was launched by the two non-profit organizations: Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana.\nThe promotion campaign consists of a journey along these territories with a minivan bearing the Bitcoin logo. The purpose of this trip is to share with the population the knowledge about the most famous cryptocurrency in the world and to present the benefits it offers. The campaign started on June 1st\nSo, the minivan tour on Argentina’s territory has begun. The trip takes place both in villages and small towns. After the tour through Argentina is over, the non-profit organizations hope to start the journey to Latin America as soon as possible.\nBitcoineta is looking to encourage disparate social localities in Bitcoin adoption. Gabriel Kurman, the co-founder of Bitcoineta, stated that: “ It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology. ”\nThe road transport was purchased and equally equipped by the two organizations. In addition to basic facilities, it also features a projector that will present educational films. These are the first destinations\nThe campaign started on June 1st, having as the first destination a small location named Chascomús. The following Bitcoineta’s destinations include “ Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba ”.\nThe project has received numerous appreciations. The university professor at the National Technological University of Argentina, Julian Drangosc expressed his view, stating that: “ The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years. ” Spread the love ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gabriel kurman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin argentina", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoineta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T15:59:49.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc651720fe3b3c2b62f1a9c30595ee6c9d6021c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAV47.LA3P469jLESFdjxSiS7HExLCWRFJvJ7VTRwVgICnnuPZSxOsJZ2t2s04dVA24pZQuvxQ.G5g--", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/04/17062358/techanalysis-btc3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc651720fe3b3c2b62f1a9c30595ee6c9d6021c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAV47.LA3P469jLESFdjxSiS7HExLCWRFJvJ7VTRwVgICnnuPZSxOsJZ2t2s04dVA24pZQuvxQ.G5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported Aayush Jindal | June 7, 2018 | 8:28 am Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported Aayush Jindal | June 7, 2018 | 8:28 am Key Points Bitcoin price moved higher and broke a major resistance near $7,650 against the US Dollar. Yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but dips remain supported around $7,600.\nBitcoin price is building bullish momentum above $7,600 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD remains buy on dips near the $7,600 and $7,500 support levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past three sessions were positive as bitcoin price managed to gain traction further above $7,500 against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded slowly higher and broke a few important hurdles near $7,600 and $7,650. There was a proper close above the $7,600 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A high was formed at $7,753 and the price is currently correcting gains.\nDuring the upside, yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If the price corrects lower from the current level, it may find support above $7,600. On the downside, an initial support is near $7,675, which was a resistance earlier . Below this, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,355 low to $7,753 high. However, the most important support on the downside is near $7,600 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly trading with a bullish bias above $7,600. On the upside, a break above the recent high at $7,753 may perhaps open the doors for a push above $7,800. Above this, the next stop for buyers might be close to the $8,000 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving nicely and is currently well above 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,600\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,750 Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported was last modified: June 7th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:15:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e1644a7d6d3f4b52277734a13c46c2a46a60bea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDlS2QKFTjGr5uWLbsWkPr1ockHCzd4UVf5Qhek_NSBvxrE1tZtdk8782ea9bTj843tP8Kg8VBkGexW5V_Vbft1MWlPmjsB8kO2UVKxzjbU49IgjLh9GLtdF8YCSVtHLcrYAUlN9ji6Ha_Kx1N9SWMWXYCHPJNJ9GpaeiTdv2x_AUS", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India City News, Indian Cities | Cities News - Times of India", "title": "BITCOIN BILLIONCAIRE: Bitcoin billionaire school dropout, fabricated documents to cheat gullible investors: Police | Thane", "title_full": "BITCOIN BILLIONCAIRE: Bitcoin billionaire school dropout, fabricated documents to cheat gullible investors: Police | Thane News - Times of India", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.147, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-64486171,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1362285,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e1644a7d6d3f4b52277734a13c46c2a46a60bea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDlS2QKFTjGr5uWLbsWkPr1ockHCzd4UVf5Qhek_NSBvxrE1tZtdk8782ea9bTj843tP8Kg8VBkGexW5V_Vbft1MWlPmjsB8kO2UVKxzjbU49IgjLh9GLtdF8YCSVtHLcrYAUlN9ji6Ha_Kx1N9SWMWXYCHPJNJ9GpaeiTdv2x_AUS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nishikant Karlikar", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN BILLIONCAIRE: Bitcoin billionaire school dropout, fabricated documents to cheat gullible investors: Police | Thane", "text": "THANE: Bitcoin billionaire Amit Lakhanpal , who sold his get-rich-soon dreams with his new-age digital currency, is a “semi-literate swindler” from Airoli, who fabricated documents to cheat gullible investors of hundreds of dollars, according to the police.\nInvestigations probing Lakhanpal’s antecedents revealed that the so-called head honcho of the Money Trade Coin (MTC) group, which is said to have offices in Europe and the Gulf region, is a school dropout who studied up to Class VIII and was till recently staying in a modest home in Airoli, Navi Mumbai.\nOfficials from the Thane crime branch on Wednesday conducted a search of his vacant Airoli residence and recovered certain documents, jewellery and cash worth a few lakhs of rupees.\n“If anything, he is a professional fraudster, who fabricated everything from his so-called PhD degree, to a certificate from a prominent international bank proclaiming bank deposits of Rs 250 crore, a fake letter of credit for Rs 1,750 crore and many more.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

After this recovery, the price of Bitcoin will begin to head towards newer highs towards the second half of this year. To this, Lee added that in the second half of 2018, Bitcoin would be more widely used. And this wide acceptance will push its price higher.\nLee considers both Bitcoin and Ether as the real blue chips among digital currencies and advised investors to consider investing in both BTC and ETH. He stated that when these cryptocurrencies are invested in, investors can be assured of enormous returns over a longer period of time.

Since then it has tumbled by about 60%. As the chart below indicates, that marks the longest stretch without a fresh record since the 1,176-day period that ended in the late summer of 2016.\nStill, some market participants have taken heart in increased regulation and institutional interest in the nascent digital-asset market, with Coinbase on Wednesday announcing its plans to purchase securities dealer Keystone Capital , a move that would place the cryptotrading platform under more direct oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer.\nIn the spot market, a single bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.03% was trading higher at $7,651.98, up about 1.7%, compared with Wednesday’s closing level on the Kraken platform as of 5 p.m. Eastern.\nMeanwhile, Jan van Eck, CEO of investment firm VanEck, discussed on CNBC the company’s plans to join with SolidX in a third attempt to launch the first bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund.\nVan Eck explained that the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust would be set up to own physical bitcoins rather than being pegged to the futures markets as an earlier version was.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip a few points, but the overall bias is positive above the $1,100 support level.\nBitcoin cash price remains in an uptrend above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past $1,160 and $1,180 to gain upside momentum. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere were mostly ranging moves above the $1,100 support area in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards the $1,170 level, but it failed to move further higher. A high was formed near $1,168 before the price started a downside correction. At the moment, it seems like there is a strong resistance area forming near $1,160, which may act as a pivot zone.\nA downward correction is underway, and the price recently broke the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high. However, the decline is finding bids near the $1,130 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Further below the 100 hourly SMA, there is a key support around the $1,100 level. Moreover, the 50% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high is also around the stated support. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the pair has to settle above the $1,160 resistance area to gain upside momentum. The next hurdles above $1,160 are seen near $1,180 and $1,200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently just above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,100 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T09:57:19.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "769f2724b4614987243fbb7924e9c88ff4953f4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ICEn8IdJwy7P_vRcnph6_ZfqY0i8MfQ_qPGHxBaKzjLqLqMzYT9Wr6R2bMV7xtL12IZY8iYSu.alM13vmqiOAwgJxZBOTJC8-", "site_full": "www.forexask.eu", "site": "forexask.eu", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are", "title_full": "SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.041, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "769f2724b4614987243fbb7924e9c88ff4953f4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ICEn8IdJwy7P_vRcnph6_ZfqY0i8MfQ_qPGHxBaKzjLqLqMzYT9Wr6R2bMV7xtL12IZY8iYSu.alM13vmqiOAwgJxZBOTJC8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Forex Price", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are", "text": "giugno 07, 2018 SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, believes that distributed ledger tech shows “incredible promise,” noting that it can drive efficiencies in the markets.

The report synthesis data from various crypto focused data sources like blockchain.info , coinmarketcap.com , and bitcoinity.org with proprietary Morgan Stanley Research to develop a number of insights into the current state of the cryptocurrency landscape.\nEven as prices have suffered, the scale and success of the cryptocurrency and initial coin offering (ICO) market has been breathtaking. Crowdsales have raised over USD 10 billion, between active and defunct coins, already in 2018 – and that total excludes the USD 4 billion raise by the recently launched EOS protocol.\nWhile trading volumes have fallen dramatically since December 2017, the overall cryptocurrency market has a value of over USD 300 billion, spread across more than 1,000 coins and tokens. advertisement\nEven with wild swings in price, Bitcoin has not achieved the status of a truly effective payment system and will likely continue to be impeded by a few key structural issues, says the report.\nHigh volatility is a part of everyday life in the land of cryptocurrency, but such substantial swings make it difficult for users to be confident the value of their Bitcoin won’t double tomorrow, making them far less likely to spend it like they would a more stable currency. Technology has been advanced to facilitate retail use, of Bitcoin in particular, to address familiar issues like transaction time and fees, but the fundamental lack of enthusiasm for spending on one candy bar today what might buy two tomorrow is reflected in almost nonexistent Bitcoin acceptance among top e-commerce retailers.\nPrice volatility also makes it more difficult for small-scale Bitcoin mining operations to remain profitable and in business, as extended price slumps can make fixed costs like facility rentals and cooling greater than the return from selling coins for revenue. Costs for electricity can also price out many miners who don’t have access to abundant cheap power. The convergence of all of these factors is the concentration of mining power into just a handful of mining pools, increasing the risk from bad behavior by members of the network and ultimately affecting the governance of the protocol itself.\nIn spite of these potential issues, Bitcoin mining shows no signs of stopping and, in fact, Morgan Stanley predicts the energy costs will rise exponentially over the coming months and years, growing to account for as much electric usage as 15 million US homes.\nWhere there’s lots of money, problems to solve, and systems to optimize, you can bet that venture capital firms and other entities related to traditional equity will continue to hunt for opportunities. Morgan Stanley research captures a blowout 2017 with the creation of over 175 cryptocurrency trading and investment funds of more than 250 total, boasting over USD 3.5 billion in AUM.\nExisting banks around the world are also taking a huge interest in blockchain technology for a wide variety of use cases, with concepts and other initiatives currently in various stages of completeness.\nA final insight jumped out for its unique perspective – Morgan Stanley Researchers have noted that the price chart for Bitcoin since August 2016 has tracked with a high correlation to the NASDAQ composite between June 1994 and 2002. While perhaps not the most actionable information, it’s the type of insight you only get from researchers and analysts who are veterans in the field of finance and can use their prior experience to make educated choices and facilitate knowledge transfer in the closely related disciplines of crypto and finance.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain - blockchain news morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T13:03:33.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2524e8784170822d7af269c064e6c0b36580a1c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5jn0ozOVQJjpj9D48aBT7WkcIF3A_q8fr9ND6UUYABsDoWlwtRLcGO_RFOyh5s_WpjzrLlCoBJzuZVerv1hX5MR.97WWOpfGXsqlEYfhCnK7ZKOHsx.xuXXKyR9pfoZf18IwsKoFVSAQuaiZWHyYK", "site_full": "www.helenabitcoinmining.com", "site": "helenabitcoinmining.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto Margin Trading Could Be Illegal Gambling, Says Korean Police - Helena Bitcoin Mining", "title_full": "Crypto Margin Trading Could Be Illegal Gambling, Says Korean Police - Helena Bitcoin Mining", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.039, "main_image": "http://www.helenabitcoinmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hbm-fb-profile.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2524e8784170822d7af269c064e6c0b36580a1c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5jn0ozOVQJjpj9D48aBT7WkcIF3A_q8fr9ND6UUYABsDoWlwtRLcGO_RFOyh5s_WpjzrLlCoBJzuZVerv1hX5MR.97WWOpfGXsqlEYfhCnK7ZKOHsx.xuXXKyR9pfoZf18IwsKoFVSAQuaiZWHyYK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wolfie Zhao", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Margin Trading Could Be Illegal Gambling, Says Korean Police - Helena Bitcoin Mining", "text": "Crypto Margin Trading Could Be Illegal Gambling, Says Korean Police June 7, 2018\nA South Korean police department is alleging the crypto margin trading offered by exchange Coinone is in effect illegal gambling.

Yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but dips remain supported around $7,600.\nBitcoin price is building bullish momentum above $7,600 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD remains buy on dips near the $7,600 and $7,500 support levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past three sessions were positive as bitcoin price managed to gain traction further above $7,500 against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded slowly higher and broke a few important hurdles near $7,600 and $7,650. There was a proper close above the $7,600 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A high was formed at $7,753 and the price is currently correcting gains.\nDuring the upside, yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If the price corrects lower from the current level, it may find support above $7,600. On the downside, an initial support is near $7,675, which was a resistance earlier. Below this, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,355 low to $7,753 high. However, the most important support on the downside is near $7,600 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nLooking at the chart, the price is clearly trading with a bullish bias above $7,600. On the upside, a break above the recent high at $7,753 may perhaps open the doors for a push above $7,800. Above this, the next stop for buyers might be close to the $8,000 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving nicely and is currently well above 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,600\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Dips Remain Supported appeared first on NewsBTC.

Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon\nLedger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Since then it has tumbled by about 60%. As the chart below indicates, that marks the longest stretch without a fresh record since the 1,176-day period that ended in the late summer of 2016.\nStill, some market participants have taken heart in increased regulation and institutional interest in the nascent digital-asset market, with Coinbase on Wednesday announcing its plans to purchase securities dealer Keystone Capital (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/coinbase-acquires-keystone-capital-in-bid-to-become-a-regulated-broker-dealer.html), a move that would place the cryptotrading platform under more direct oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer.\nIn the spot market, a single bitcoin was trading higher at $7,651.98, up about 1.7%, compared with Wednesday's closing level on the Kraken platform as of 5 p.m. Eastern.\nMeanwhile, Jan van Eck, CEO of investment firm VanEck, discussed on CNBC the company's plans to join with SolidX in a third attempt to launch (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/vaneck-renews-bitcoin-etf-effort-with-an-institutional-focus-2018-06-07-8463015) the first bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund.\nVan Eck explained (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/07/vaneck-bitcoin-etf.html?play=1) that the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust would be set up to own physical bitcoins rather than being pegged to the futures markets as an earlier version was. He was hopeful that changes that have been made to address a litany of regulatory concerns about bitcoin ETFs will now pass muster with the SEC.\nIn trading on bitcoin futures markets, the Cboe June contract finished the day up 2.2% at $7,692.50, while the CME June contract also settled about 2.2% higher at $7,705.\n-Mark DeCambre;\n 1733ET\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/1004820597921275906),", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/07/vaneck-bitcoin-etf.html?play=1)", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/coinbase-acquires-keystone-capital-in-bid-to-become-a-regulated-broker-dealer.html),", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/vaneck-renews-bitcoin-etf-effort-with-an-institutional-focus-2018-06-07-8463015)"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark decambre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charlie bilello", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "keystone capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pension partners", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T05:44:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "448933fccd8c6383d25a53ac1edc543a2dd3d0e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptcrAgGE.AW2EmN0g30ZSJY9PV0xekDQ9EZQGz9tBgFNaZpu0_pNzPoa_DKA8PrmkumPg5gliU8sycGH7wr7gy7mBX7B.L_T3CDBbFEDUopUGpeU_lz79mNo0eAiWbX2dt7_e9t_FyJvbQQ2NpMkAZm", "site_full": "mycryptodictionary.com", "site": "mycryptodictionary.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto - My Crypto Dictionary", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto - My Crypto Dictionary", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://mycryptodictionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bug-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "448933fccd8c6383d25a53ac1edc543a2dd3d0e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptcrAgGE.AW2EmN0g30ZSJY9PV0xekDQ9EZQGz9tBgFNaZpu0_pNzPoa_DKA8PrmkumPg5gliU8sycGH7wr7gy7mBX7B.L_T3CDBbFEDUopUGpeU_lz79mNo0eAiWbX2dt7_e9t_FyJvbQQ2NpMkAZm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Foskaaymycd App", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto - My Crypto Dictionary", "text": "PLACE YOUR ADS HERE- CLICK FOR DETAILS Views: 173\nThe most important thing about bitcoin is the new freedom-enhancing innovations that the technology enables, but we know that’s not what everyone is looking for these days.

Also Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center How to Make $120,000 in a Week Are you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug -ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that? Guido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work.

The campaign will comprise a minivan boldly donning the bitcoin logo embarking on a road trip across Argentina and Latin America with the goal of spreading knowledge and fostering bitcoin adoption.\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Drowning in Tokens Latin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign\nNon-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ‘ Bitcoineta ‘ – a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption.\nThe tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America.\nThe project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, “It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.”\nThe two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films. Sowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption\nThe Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba.\nJulian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, “The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.”\nDo you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

Food Would Be Better Than Bitcoin In Worst-Case Scenario\nChanos is most famous for having predicted the fall of American energy giant Enron Corporation before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. When asked to share his thoughts on cryptos, Chanos minced no words as he tore into cryptos, terming them a libertarian fantasy. While he has no doubt that the fiat currencies which Bitcoin seeks to replace could one day bring the world to its knees, Bitcoin is still the last thing he’d want to own if the grid went down.\nAnd what is Bitcoin good for?\nBitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\nCrypto enthusiasts hail the blockchain and cryptos as revolutionary, yet these proponents still turn to old technology, Chanos claims. Giving an example of an early crypto enthusiast who made money from crypto trading in 2017 but was still using a fax machine to cash in on his earnings, Chanos reiterated his belief that cryptos were nothing but a security speculation which is touted as a technological breakthrough that will transform the current monetary system.\nSomeone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a “monetary Somalia.”\nThe crypto craze of the past year fits the classic fraud cycle, the man who also teaches a course on financial fraud at Yale University stated. In the cycle, people’s caution and skepticism gradually fade away as the financial markets improve, and they begin to invest in projects they ordinarily wouldn’t have. This makes it easier for fraudsters to carry out their activities. Once the financial cycle dies down, those fraudsters become easy to spot.\nChanos also believes that cryptos would work the least in a worst-case scenario, contrary to many people’s belief. Many crypto enthusiasts believe that a fiat apocalypse is on its way and that cryptos will save the day, but they would not – especially not as a store of value.\nFood would work the best!\nChanos echoed the sentiments of fellow economist and renowned crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini. Roubini has vocally expressed his skepticism on as many platforms as have been available to him. A favorite at many financial industry discussion panels, he has referred to cryptos as the biggest bubble in human history and a “colossal pump and dump scheme.” Roubini has also called out crypto projects, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, for claiming that they are decentralized while the mining of these digital assets is controlled by big companies that can afford expensive mining equipment.

Our algorithms ❤ volatility. Backed by @YCombinator. Jun 7 Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Stacking Up a Currency Against a Supercomputer Almost three years ago, the first public version of Ethereum was released. The new blockchain was born from a whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin, a young man who cut his teeth in the cryptocurrency space writing for Bitcoin Magazine. Ethereum distinguished itself from Bitcoin right from the start, in its whitepaper. Whereas Bitcoin was intended to be a digital currency or a store of value , Ethereum was intended to be a kind of decentralized supercomputer: “a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create ‘contracts’ that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions.” These two very different blockchains now have the two largest market caps of any cryptocurrencies, with BTC at $128,469,761,721 USD at time of writing, and ETH at $58,534,876,766 USD. But beyond their mutual success, how have these two cryptocurrencies performed relative to each other over the years? Here’s how Ethereum stacked up to Bitcoin back then, on August 7, 2015: Here’s how that compares to Bitcoin vs Ethereum today (May 24, 2018): In the last years, Ethereum has grown into the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, currently valued at almost $60 billion behind Bitcoin’s almost $130 million. But, contrary to what groups such as those advocating “The Flippening” would have you believe, this growth isn’t the story of one cryptocurrency fighting to eclipse another: rather, it’s the story of two very different kinds of projects succeeding, driving the growth of a whole new sector. Bitcoin and Ethereum have radically different use cases How would you compare Apple to Amazon ? Sure, they’re both publicly traded technology companies, but they’re also businesses with totally different goals, business models, and products. That’s what it’s like to compare Bitcoin and Ethereum: even though they’re both leading blockchain networks, they have totally different goals, use cases, and design philosophies. You can see this in the structure of each network. Coding for Bitcoin is like writing assembly code, whereas coding for Ethereum is much more flexible and capacious. This is no accident: Bitcoin is intended to be digital money and a store of value, but this makes its programmability limited: you don’t want someone programming and stealing your money at the same time. Ethereum is intended as a development platform and therefore is easy to program — but that makes it susceptible to vulnerabilities like the parity bug and the DAO hack. If Bitcoin and Ethereum were designed for different things, then what exactly are their use cases? Take a look at this table: This chart reflects that, fundamentally, Ethereum is a platform, whereas Bitcoin is more of a currency . Therefore, Ethereum isn’t competitive with Bitcoin: unlike Bitcoin Cash, which intends to supplant Bitcoin as a form of digital cash, BTC and ETH can and have grown without cannibalizing each other. The smart contracts that operate on Ethereum’s virtual machine are empowering developers to build everything from collectible, non-fungible cartoon cats to decentralized securities exchanges. This platform-oriented design has led increasingly more developers to rally around Ethereum, which has been reflected in the growth of the network’s annual developer conference, Devcon: in three years, it’s grown from 50 attendees to over 2,000. The growth of Ethereum’s Devcon over the last three years. Source: What is Ethereum? People have recognized the value of Ethereum as a platform, which is most obvious in the amount of money that’s been put into ICOs — ”initial coin offerings” — by startups issuing tokens built on the Ethereum network. In 2017, over $5.6 billion was invested in ICOs ; that entire amount was surpassed by the first three months of ICO investment in 2018, which totaled $6.3 billion. According to CNBC, ICO investments now surpass early-stage VC funding for internet companies. That’s not to say VCs haven’t been paying attention, though — for example, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures invested a combined $12M in CryptoKitties. The heavy focus on ICOs in the press might make you think that all the developers are flocking to Ethereum from Bitcoin, but that’s not the case. In fact, if you take a look at Github, you’ll see that ‘Bitcoin’ is mentioned in almost 60% more repos than ‘Ethereum’ is. Search results for ‘Ethereum’ and ‘Bitcoin’ on Github. Source: github.com. How can we make sense of the discrepancy between the many public development projects on Ethereum and the broader development community behind Bitcoin? This seems to be a case of breadth vs. depth: whereas Ethereum has people working on a huge diversity of projects (ICOs, layer 2 protocols, etc), Bitcoin has many people working on a single thing (Bitcoin). The difference in the cryptocurrencies’ communities, in other words, reflects the difference in their use cases. Ethereum has grown faster than Bitcoin A product that invents a new market will have to work hard to get traction. The products that follow it in that market will have a correspondingly easier time getting traction. Only by carving out their own niches will these different products survive in the long run. You can see this all over the place: Uber and Lyft Netflix and Hulu Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin didn’t surpass a $55 billion market cap until August 8th of last year — over 7 years into its existence. Ethereum crossed that market cap for the first time on December 13th of last year, just about 2-and-a-half years into its existence. A comparison of the long arc of Bitcoin’s market cap growth and the much shorter arc of Ethereum’s market cap growth. Source: bitinfocharts.com. Ethereum also captured a fair amount of overall market dominance from Bitcoin fairly quickly, despite the facts that it was relatively late to the cryptocurrency space and Bitcoin had the advantage of being the very first cryptocurrency. A comparison chart of Bitcoin dominance and Ethereum dominance. Source: coinmarketcap.com. It took Bitcoin until December 9, 2015 — over 5 years — to reach a daily transaction volume of 200,000 transactions, whereas Ethereum reached this benchmark on June 6th of last year — about 2 years into its existence. That was the point at which Ethereum’s daily transaction volume surpassed Bitcoin’s. Comparison of daily transaction volume between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Source: bitinfocharts.com. As with products in other sectors, the first mover (Bitcoin) and the follow-up (Ethereum) have been able to both survive because they are complementary, rather than competitive. People can and do endorse both Ethereum as a platform and Bitcoin as a store of value. And, all things considered, it’s probably better that Bitcoin came first: the notion of “digital gold” is easier to grasp than a “decentralized supercomputer,” meaning that BTC probably primed people to understand ETH’s value proposition more readily. Scaling is a more pressing issue for Ethereum than for Bitcoin Both Ethereum and Bitcoin need to handle many more transactions than they can at present — but that need is more urgent for one of them than it is for the other. To get a rough-and-ready handle on orders of magnitude, think about the transaction goals of Bitcoin and Ethereum as similar to those of VISA and Facebook, respectively. Facebook handles roughly 200,000 transactions per second (assuming roughly 1 million users online at any given minute , each taking an action every 5 seconds). Assuming that Bitcoin wants to have the transactional capacity of VISA and Ethereum wants to be able to support dapps as far-reaching as Facebook, Ethereum has to be able to handle transactions that are an order of magnitude greater than Bitcoin’s. This is why Ethereum is pursuing a slew of scaling solutions, whereas Bitcoin is only really focused on a single main solution right now. Here are some of the main strategies Ethereum developers are pursuing right now to help with scaling: Ethereum developers are well aware of how much they need to scale in order to run dapps with billions of people, which is why so many teams are targeting basically any opportunity, on-chain or off-chain, to increase Ethereum’s transaction capacity. In contrast, Bitcoin is mainly focused on using Lightning Network to increase its transaction capacity. This is a Layer-2 scaling solution that provides an off-chain payment channel for the network. In that way, it’s similar to Raiden Network  — one of the many scaling solutions that Ethereum developers are pursuing. Over time, it’s virtually inevitable that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will scale tremendously. But right now, it’s more important for a decentralized supercomputer to handle tons of transactions than it is for digital gold or digital cash. The future of Bitcoin and Ethereum: a complementary ecosystem The success of Bitcoin is not mutually exclusive from the success of Ethereum. In fact, having robust developer communities behind both cryptocurrencies probably does a lot to improve the chances of crypto succeeding as an entire sector. Ethereum may be chasing Bitcoin in terms of market cap, but both BTC and ETH are still very much in the early days of growing and maturing. Time will tell what lies ahead for their communities.

Bitcoin Price Stagnant, but Not for Long As of late, uncertainties with regard to regulations and the seizure of Bitcoin in legal cases like Mt. Gox, which led to the unloading of coins on exchanges , has caused some stagnation. This means that, according to experts, the short-term crypto forecast is expected to remain relatively static — though not for long. “I believe Bitcoin’s price will continue to fluctuate between $6,500 and $8,500 in the coming weeks,” David Hanson, a blockchain expert and CEO of the gaming platform Ultra, told the Independent . He continued: “In the medium-to-long term, Bitcoin’s value should go up, as big institutions enter the crypto space in a bid to gain first-mover advantage, further legitimising the market.” This idea that institutional investors will provide a boost to the digital currency (and altcoins) is shared by other figures in the space, who are looking at the cryptocurrency to break the $10,000 barrier again in coming months. Despite the drop from almost $20,000 in December, and the fact that the number one crypto has not gone above $10,000 since March (though it came awfully close in early-May), more people and companies alike are getting interested in the coin — and this is set to show, according to Iqbal Gandham, the U.K. managing director of eToro. “As the regulatory landscape clears up we can expect far more investors, including big ticket institutions, to make their first cryptocurrency investments,” he said. He went on to say: “For the first few months of this year, the crypto industry has been jogging along at a relatively slow pace, waiting for the opportunity to stretch into a sprint. This may just be that moment.” Bitcoin Predictions Look to 95% Gains by Year End At the beginning of the year, following the register of all time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the end of 2017, price predictions were very positive. Tim Draper, an early backer of Tesla, Skype, and SpaceX, and one of the most high-profile Bitcoin investors, said that it could hit $250,000 by 2022 . Although Draper did not disclose the method he used to calculate his forecast, a comparable number was provided by Horizon Kinetics’ Murray Stahl, who argued that the digital currency could be worth the value of all the currency in the world. He believes this is the case because fiat money can be ‘debased,’ but there will be only 21 million Bitcoins ever made. Another person with positive price predictions is Alistair Milne, the self-described ‘Bitcoin evangelist.’ Milne has stated that he believes Bitcoin will reach between $35,000 and $60,000 by the end of 2019. Following Milne’s lead, similar numbers were suggested by a panel of crypto experts put together by price comparison site Finder.com, who originally stated that Bitcoin would hit $33,000 by the end of this year. This week the panel released a revised figure , bringing the prediction to less than half the initial outlook at just $14,638 — but those are still great gains on Bitcoin’s current price of just under $7,700, according to CoinMarketCap.

So in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief we also feature a surefire way to make a quick fortune in cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center How to Make $120,000 in a Week\nAre you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon\nLedger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

BTC/USD remains buy on dips near the $7,600 and $7,500 support levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past three sessions were positive as bitcoin price managed to gain traction further above $7,500 against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded slowly higher and broke a few important hurdles near $7,600 and $7,650. There was a proper close above the $7,600 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A high was formed at $7,753 and the price is currently correcting gains.\nDuring the upside, yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If the price corrects lower from the current level, it may find support above $7,600. On the downside, an initial support is near $7,675, which was a resistance earlier . Below this, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,355 low to $7,753 high. However, the most important support on the downside is near $7,600 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly trading with a bullish bias above $7,600. On the upside, a break above the recent high at $7,753 may perhaps open the doors for a push above $7,800.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Jay Clayton, the Chairman of US Securities and Exchange Commission has clarified his views on Bitcoin by referring to it as “replacements for sovereign currencies.”\nControversial enough, Roger Ver stated that Bitcoin Cash meet-ups had a turn-out of more than 125 people, which is supposedly far lesser than the number of people turning up for BTC meet-ups. Mr. Ver went around giving away BCH t-shirts and assuring more and more people to support and learn about the community so that they can receive money in their Bitcoin Cash wallets at the speed of light.\nThis is not the first time Mr. Ver has attacked BTC in order to show support to the Bitcoin Cash community.\nRoger Ver stated:\n“I have been telling people about Bitcoin since 2011. It allows you to send and receive any amount of money with anyone and anywhere instantly basically for free, and there is nothing anybody can do to stop it. This speech is still 100% true about Bitcoin cash today but no longer true about BTC.”\nHe later goes about asking friends and merchants to provide their support towards accepting BCH. Investors were asked to visit ‘free.bitcoin.com’ to earn free Bitcoin Cash. Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash share the same genesis block.\nMemo.cash also provides zero manipulation when it comes to posting your opinions right into the blockchain and more people are going to support it because it is not centrally controlled. Ver believes that “destruction is the key to progress” while talking about regulatory bodies shutting down or disrupting the issue of digital currencies. Another website called Moneytoken.com has already started using BCH as a store of value with the advancements in its scaling technology.\nA Twitter enthusiast, Douglas Sloan, commented:\n“If you think it’s a scam, don’t put in $$$. Time will tell. I would love to know the motivations of those who spend time tearing down the hard work of brilliant folks trying to make a difference.”\nJoannes Vermorel, the CEO of Lokad has been working on developing the potential for the supply chains on Bitcoin cash with “faster than light transactions”.\nHe further stated:\n“I believe that the BCH community does not allow any incompetent people and are more driven.
