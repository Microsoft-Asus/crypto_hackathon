Morgan\nFortune via fortune.com As Wall Street giants circle Bitcoin and the Blockchain, the largest of the bunch by asset, J.P. Morgan, is sinking its toes in a little deeper.J.P. Morgan created a new position dubbed Head of Crypto-Assets Strategy, naming Oliver Harris, previously head of the banking giant’s in-residence program for fintech startups, to the role.With his new title, Harris will seek out cryptocurrency projects that can be taken to market, Fortune has learned.Harris will work under the umbrella of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain initiative, headed by Umar Farooq.The bank has been experimenting with the blockchain — an immutable ledger of, oftentimes, transactions — over the past two years in a bid to solve banking-related inefficiencies.One experiment resulted in the creation of Quorum, an Ethereum-based blockchain for payments aimed at businesses.Notably, J.P. Morgan partnered with the team behind cryptocurrency Zcash to increase the privacy on that blockchain.Harris is also set to lead the execution of that project, working closely with Christine Moy, program lead for J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence.That’s not to say the banking giant is suddenly hopping into Bitcoin trading in the way Goldman Sachs has done — at least not yet.When asked about the future of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and the bank potentially trading the asset, J.P. Morgan’s Head of Corporate and Investment Banking told CNBC: “We are looking into the space.” Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

Lightning: 1997 Nodes, 6600 Channels, $150,000 Capacity\nData captured from an overview of LN’s Bitcoin mainnet integration showed 1997 reachable nodes (with the actual number presumably much higher) at press time, with 6614 open channels and a total network capacity in excess of $150,000.\nDespite remaining a challenging tool in terms of user interface, the technology has markedly improved in the approximately five months it has been active.\nIn addition to countless bespoke tools and add-ons building out its ecosystem, Lightning’s credibility has already earned it accolades from players including Microsoft, which in February championed layered Bitcoin scaling solutions.\nSpeaking at Consensus 2018 conference this week, Blockstream researcher and software developer Christian Becker noted that with enough Lightning channels, each of which can process around 500 transactions per second, Bitcoin could beat the transaction capacity of both other cryptocurrencies and Visa.\nAs more users begin interacting with the network, its impact on Bitcoin transactions has hit the headlines.\nTaking to social media, Yalls.org creator Alex Bosworth uploaded evidence of the savings possible using LN to make sales against performing the same transaction via a credit card.\nIn Bosworth’s case, a 2.9% charge, $0.30 in fees and a $0.50 minimum processing fee contrasts sharply with Lightning, which as Bitcoinist previously reported , can be used de facto for free and enables sending amounts less than a satoshi (one hundred millionth of a bitcoin and the smallest possible unit that can be used on-chain).

Finance.\n“Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.”\nWhat do you think about the Lightning Network’s growth?

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com.\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.

Bitcoin and Electricity Usage That said, determining exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy in the future, is not straightforward. According to blockchain specialist Alex de Vries , who works at the tax advising firm PwC in the Netherlands: “We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.” The estimates, based on de Vries’ background in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts — as noted, almost as much electricity as Ireland. Another comparison puts a single transaction as using about as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in an entire month. One of the biggest factors that contributes to the coin’s high electricity usage is also an inherent part of its design. Since its inception Bitcoin’s decentralized consensus has been enabled by its proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, and the mining machines that perform this ‘work’ need tremendous amounts of energy to do so. According to research published in April by equity analyst Charlie Chan and his team at Morgan Stanley, the key price point for Bitcoin mining profitability is $8,600 . As per their simulation, if the coin can’t stay above $8,600, many Bitcoin miners will likely find it unprofitable to keep creating the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s Energy Cost Moving Forward Moving forward, the electricity needed to operate the Bitcoin network is only going to increase. By the end of 2018, de Vries predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts — as much electricity as the European country of Austria. Looking further ahead, if the price of Bitcoin continues to increase as some experts predict , de Vries believes the network could someday consume as much as 5% of the world’s total electricity, a tenfold increase from today’s 0.5%. “To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. Another consideration environmentally is Bitcoin’s carbon footprint. The problem is that much of the coin’s network is fueled by coal-fired power plants in China , where electricity is produced at very low rates, but the impact on the environment is more marked. Based on ‘conservative’ estimates from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index , the carbon footprint for each unique Bitcoin transaction totals almost 450 kilograms of CO2, which translates to 32,898 kilotons annually for the entire network.

However, it seems like the company decided to take a break, or a separate group from the company decided to come ahead and announced an entirely new device, the HTC Exodus. It will be a block-chain based smartphone that will be “dedicated to decentralised applications.” According to the announcement on the website, there are no specifications in terms of what hardware the device will pack. Instead, the website talks about the technology that the smartphone will pack.\nThe page has also added a ‘Reserve Now’ button for any potential buyers who want to buy a blockchain-based smartphone. It adds that Exodus will come with a “universal wallet” that will support cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dfinity, and Lightning Networks Plus, among others. The interesting part about this is the fact that the company claims it wants to reshape the internet by decentralising the internet. The company also issued a call to internet and smartphone users to gather in an attempt to “Take back the internet.”\nWatch this Zee Business video here:\nUniversal Wallet is not the only feature that HTC has outlined with the Exodus and other features include ‘DApps’ also known as decentralised apps which users can adapt to take advantage of blockchain technology. HTC claims that the device will be “The Switzerland of Protocols with the ability to operate between different blockchains and each device will act as a node. The more devices that are used, the more decentralised the system becomes.\nSource: DNA India ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:47:55.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2234f3964ef0eff126af547e2dc5e055d4a5408d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPllQI6l2KTLRe__BetrgJGSFsbL28TH8e8ZkxsNPPxSDF9loKIqCHvDbVZp2IrRLIVKdam5mxKL4LUuFU2syQ.6g--", "site_full": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Shows No Growth After Consensus 2018 | Lee's Prediction Fails", "title_full": "Bitcoin Shows No Growth After Consensus 2018 | Lee's Prediction Fails", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/Tom-Lee-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Fail.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2234f3964ef0eff126af547e2dc5e055d4a5408d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPllQI6l2KTLRe__BetrgJGSFsbL28TH8e8ZkxsNPPxSDF9loKIqCHvDbVZp2IrRLIVKdam5mxKL4LUuFU2syQ.6g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Siraj Sarwar", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Shows No Growth After Consensus 2018 | Lee's Prediction Fails", "text": "Ad Tom Lee Bitcoin Price Prediction Fail – Bitcoin Is Not Rallying As Expected\nBitcoin shows no growth: Bitcoin Price (BTC) hasn’t moved higher despite the Consensus Summit: Bitcoin price trades in the range of $8,300 today after briefly touching $8,800 level at the beginning of the week. The largest coin has posted losses in last two consecutive days. This downside move is contrary to analyst’s predictions who were expecting a strong rally amid the New York consensus summit.\nIndeed, Tom Lee – who has predicted Bitcoin price to reach $25K by the end of this year – failed to predict the price movement during the consensus summit correctly.\nTom had anticipated bitcoin price to jump from 10% to 70% amid Coindesks conference.\nThe price movement in the last three days was also quite contrary to historical precedents .

The president also believes that Dollar is in the better position to work as the leader in currency markets.\nBullard said . “ The dollar, on the other hand, is backed by a stable government with direct and sensical monetary policy and persistently low inflation — because of that, it can better achieve the goals and meet the needs of the market .” Bing’s Ad Ban Supports Selloff\nThe selloff also received support from Bing’s cryptocurrency ad-ban policy.

It would work like overnight money-market sweep accounts.\n“Every dollar you have that’s not paper gets swept into an overnight rate somewhere,” said Robert Leshner, founder and chief executive at Compound. “That’s exactly what we’re trying to create.”\nSo, first of all, what is your numéraire? Money-market funds aim to achieve a stable value, but in what currency? One assumes it is whatever gets swept: If you have 100 Bitcoins that get swept overnight on Monday, you’d hope that they’d come back worth like 100.01 Bitcoins on Tuesday, even if those 100.01 Tuesday Bitcoins are worth twice, or half, as many dollars as the 100 Monday ones. Leshner explains by email:\nYou have 100 bitcoins, and you send them to Compound's smart contract.\nThey get loaned to traders who want to buy even more volatile investments (like other tokens) using the bitcoin, or to short-sellers who hate bitcoin, and want to sell it for dollars. Those borrowers have to maintain an excess of collateral (any other tokenized asset) at Compound.\nThe next day you have … 100.01 bitcoins inside Compound.\nOkay sure but … “even more volatile” is … pretty volatile? Like, if I borrow $100 from you to buy three magic beans, and I overcollateralize that loan by leaving six magic beans with you, you are still exposed to the vagaries of the magic-bean market, you know? I worry that a Bitcoin money-market fund that makes its money by, like, margin lending to initial-coin-offering speculators might run the risk of breaking the buck (the Bitcoin) with some frequency.\nBut there is a deeper conceptual strangeness to this. I used to design derivatives for a living at an investment bank. Occasionally in derivatives design you need to put a pot of cash somewhere, and it was a dumb slow revelation to me how hard it is to … just … have ... a pot of cash. You can keep $20 in your wallet, but if you want to hold $20 million, then you will face a series of agonizing choices. You can keep it all in literal cash—in boxes of $20 bills in the corner of your office—but that is not very secure and not very convenient; if you want to send it to someone you have to put the boxes on a plane with a security guard. And there is no convenient electronic form of just, in the strictest sense, cash. You can put your dollars in a bank account, but the bank could go bust. (Deposit insurance has limits.) You can buy Treasury bills, but those mature, and meanwhile can lose (a tiny bit of) value as interest rates change. You can put your money into a money-market fund, but that could, however improbably, lose value too. None of these risks are all that material over an overnight time horizon. But if you have a lot of dollars, and your quite modest goal is “I want to have always exactly this amount of dollars on every day in the future, accessible anywhere, with absolutely no credit or market risk of any kind,” you can’t do it.\nIt is a little boggling, honestly. The reason all of everyone’s dollars are always getting swept up into an overnight rate somewhere—it’s not just because people have a deep desire to get paid interest; it’s also because those dollars have to go somewhere. They can never rest; even your most idle savings-account dollar is constantly being blasted through the economy, being put to use by someone else while you sleep. The interest compensates you for the uncanniness of having to hold your dollars through someone, some not-perfectly-riskless entity. It tells you something about the nature of dollars: that they are not pure entities that you can just conveniently own, that they are instead always somehow obligations of someone else, that they exist only as some form of debt.\nThat is the thing that Bitcoin is solving. Bitcoin is a form of cash that can be held directly by anyone in purely electronic portable transferable form without a bank. (Or a money-market sweep account.) “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” The reason the cash in your brokerage account gets swept into money-market funds every night is that it’d be idiotic for your broker to keep a bunch of $20 bills in an envelope with your name on it. The reason the Bitcoins in your Bitcoin-exchange account don’t get swept into money-market funds every night is that it’s easy for a Bitcoin exchange to hold onto those Bitcoins electronically, because that is the whole point of Bitcoin.\nI mean, that is one reason; the other reason is that no one thought of a crypto-money-market sweep account yet. Now they have! Now instead of just directly owning Bitcoins in decentralized form, you can own them through an exchange, and it can own them through a Compound smart contract, and the contract can lend them to some ICO speculator or Bitcoin short-seller, and your Bitcoins can bop off around the blockchain doing productive work in weird places while you sleep, and the whole regular financial system can be recreated in a slightly skewed way.\nHoweyCoin.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to demonstrate the risk of unregistered initial coin offerings, launched its own fake ICO for “HoweyCoins.” I mean, they were not especially committed to the premise; as far as I can tell they put up a website for HoweyCoins and also simultaneously a different and better publicized website explaining that “If You Responded To An Investment Offer Like This, You Could Have Been Scammed – HoweyCoins Are Completely Fake!” Anyway like 20 of you sent me this story; I don’t think I’ve ever had more readers mention anything to me. It does make sense that the audience for Money Stuff and the audience for SEC pranks would overlap perfectly.\nThe prank is, I don’t know, fine I guess? The white paper has some good parody blather like “By undercutting the monopoly role of the national governments in creating currency, savings that you may not realize are being kept by the elite and the government will flow to you—the consumer.” But it is missing all the … like … crypto-blather? There are no incomprehensible sections on technical implementation, no funny diagrams explaining how the coin works, no bios of the technical team. The word “blockchain” appears only four times in eight pages; the words “hash” and “ERC-20” don’t appear at all. It’s just a little thin. We talked a while back about a prank that the Alberta Securities Commission pulled, in which they ran a fake investment seminar “to educate Albertans about the realities of investment fraud.” “Everything about the fake investment opportunity – from the company's name and logo, to Jonathan Fisher's bio and the colour of his tie – was extensively researched,” read the story, and I mentioned that running prank investment frauds for a securities regulator would be a dream job. Next time the SEC wants a prank ICO I’d be happy to help!\nAlso guys the name. I get it. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. is the Supreme Court case that created the modern test—widely referred to as the “Howey Test”—for what counts as a “security,” a question of significant interest to people trying to figure out which ICOs need to be registered with the SEC. If you are a securities lawyer who works on ICOs, you probably got a teeny grim chuckle out of that. But it doesn’t make sense within the world the SEC is building. HoweyCoin’s pitch is vaguely about travel benefits. It should be called TravelCoin or TripBit or CryptoVoyage, something that makes the reader think “oh yes this was named by someone who thought it was a coin for travel benefits,” not, like, “oh yes this was named by securities lawyers playing a prank.”\nOops!\nThere is a common but erroneous belief that securities fraud is only securities fraud when it involves publicly traded companies. “If a public company did this, it would be securities fraud,” people sometimes say about stuff that private companies do that is in fact securities fraud. There is nothing particularly in the law to support this view, but there is an understandable intuition behind it. Regular people buy shares of public companies based on information provided by the companies: Mom-and-pop investors can read a company’s securities filings and decide to buy its stock on the stock exchange, and if those filings are full of lies then the company is entirely to blame and the investors are innocent victims.\nBut private transactions are a little different. Private companies, of course, disclose less information publicly than public ones do. But when venture capitalists buy stakes in private tech companies, or when private-equity firms do leveraged buyouts, they tend to get a lot more information about the companies than regular public investors do when they buy stock on the stock exchange. This is called “due diligence,” and the idea is that sophisticated private investors who are writing very large checks are supposed to be able to ask good questions, and get satisfying answers to those questions, before writing those checks.\nIn practice this often isn’t true—big sexy tech unicorns can raise money with essentially no financial information—but it actually matters that it is true in theory. If you are a sophisticated private-equity investor writing a $100-million check to buy a company, and you have the opportunity to do due diligence and interview company management and review the financial statements and talk to the auditors and examine the customer lists and so forth, and the company sends you a pack of lies, and you don’t catch them and buy the company anyway, then yes, of course, that is the company’s fault, and the company did a bad thing, but it is also your fault too, in a way that it isn’t a public investor’s fault. Your job is to notice that stuff!\nAnd so for instance Theranos Inc.’s private investors, who were victims of a “massive fraud,” get quite unsympathetic press: They were rich and sophisticated and had every opportunity to do due diligence, and if they got hoodwinked then that reflects almost as badly on them as it does on the hoodwinkers. It is embarrassing to be the victim of securities fraud when you are a sophisticated large investor who had the opportunity to do due diligence, which means that these frauds are less likely to be pursued than frauds against public investors. Who would want to report them?\nYesterday the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice brought civil and criminal securities-fraud cases against three former executives of Constellation Healthcare Technologies Inc. Constellation was actually a publicly traded company, but the fraud charges are not about its public trading—which occurred on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market and is therefore none of the SEC’s business—but about a going-private transaction that it completed in early 2017. The buyer was Chinh Chu, who left the Blackstone Group LP to start his own buyout firm, and who put up $82.5 million of equity and borrowed $130 million from banks to do the deal. “Sources who have spoken with Mr Chu say he’s ‘comfortable’ proceeding, having spent $7m and three months work on due diligence alone,” reported Paul Murphy at the time.\nIt didn’t work! Constellation went bankrupt this March, and according to the SEC it was kind of fake. For instance, the SEC tells the story of Constellation’s acquisition of MDRX Medical Billing LLC for $30 million:\nIn reality, MDRX too was a fabrication that Defendants had created based on a genuine Akron, Ohio-based medical-billing business (the “Real Medical-Billing Business”). In October 2015, CHT was contacted by an investment bank about a potential acquisition of the Real Medical-Billing Business.\nCHT entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the investment bank, which in turn gave Defendants a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation pitching the Real Medical-Billing Business. …\nThe Defendants then altered the investment bank’s PowerPoint presentation pitching the Real Medical-Billing Business to create a sham MDRX “Due Diligence Findings Draft Report” dated October 20, 2015. The sham MDRX report essentially left the entire description of the Real Medical-Billing Business, including the company’s organizational chart, untouched, but inflated the company’s financials and simply changed the company’s name to MDRX, an entirely fictitious entity.\nEmails among Defendants evidence their fabrication of MDRX. On October 22, 2015, Chivukula forwarded the MDRX PowerPoint to Parmar and Zaharis, noting, “Attached is the updated internal document and presentation. I am not able to remove the background image of [the Real Medical-Billing Business] in the presentation.”\nAnd the executives allegedly provided all sorts of fake stuff during Chu’s due diligence; the SEC says that he “relied on Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and false and fabricated documents in determining whether to enter into the transaction.” You would hope that, in a nine-digit transaction led by a top-tier buyout expert and financed with bank loans, with months of due diligence, someone would notice that, you know, the company’s medical billing business was plagiarized from a real business and still had the real business’s logo in the background. “The filings give us the impression the alleged fraud was less ‘large, complex and brazen’ than the bankruptcy declaration makes it sound, and rather more maladroit and hapless,” writes Alexandra Scaggs, and while I am not sure I completely agree, really you never want to be suckered as badly as this, even by a complex fraud. If the allegations are true then the perpetrators are bad and might go to jail, but it is hard to escape the feeling that the victims look bad too.\nCBS v. Redstone.\nWe’ve talked over the last two days about the terrific drama over CBS Corp.’s board of director’s effort to get rid of its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., by diluting away its voting stock. A lot happened in that case yesterday—first NAI amended CBS’s bylaws to take away the board’s power to dilute it, and then a Delaware court ordered NAI not to interfere with CBS’s preparations to hold the board meeting today to vote on diluting NAI—but in another sense nothing really happened. CBS still wants to dilute NAI, NAI still doesn’t want to be diluted, what will happen still turns entirely on the decision of the Delaware chancellor hearing the case, and he still hasn’t decided. But he’s supposed to decide today, before the 5 p.m. board meeting, so that is something to look forward to.\nI actually think this case is extremely straightforward: No, obviously, a board of directors cannot get rid of a controlling shareholder just because they are worried that she might fire them! She’s allowed to fire them! That’s what being a controlling shareholder means! But I am not a Delaware chancellor. And I guess if I were I would draw out the suspense a little. Why not? I bet it’s the most fun he’s had in years. “I've never seen anything like what's transpired here in terms of moving parts,” he said, at the end of yesterday’s hearing.\nHedge-fund names.\nHere is a word cloud or whatever from SumZero of common features of hedge-fund names, if you are looking for inspiration for your own fund. “Popular themes that popped up on their word chart included nautical terms, alcoholic drinks, and cities in New England,” so please invest in my new fund, Swampscott Tequila Yacht Capital LP.\nThings happen.\n‘I Am the Mastermind’: Mohammed bin Salman’s Guide to Getting Rich.

The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development is looking into the possible uses of digital coins and the associated technologies. Kazakhstan is calling for the adoption of common crypto rules by the United Nations, while Iran and Russia are thinking about using cryptocurrency in bilateral trade.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu OECD Explores Cryptos and ICOs The Committee on Digital Economy at the Organization of Economic Development and Cooperation ( OECD ) has started exploring blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The international body also wants to help governments of member-states develop and implement legislation aimed at protecting consumer rights in electronic trade.\nAccording to Elina Sidorenko, head of Russia’s interdepartmental group working to assess risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies, the OECD will be used as a platform to discuss matters related to cryptos and token sales. These discussions will be held in the context of ensuring the safety of consumers of financial services, she said in a post on her Telegram channel .\nThe OECD and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) recognize the role of cryptocurrency as a means of payment and accumulation, Sidorenko emphasized. Both organizations also view ICOs as a good mechanism to attract funding, she added. “I hope that the generally positive rhetoric on cryptocurrencies in the OECD will not change,” the Russian official said, promising to keep her followers informed on further developments. Astana Calls for UN Crypto Rules\nKazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev thinks that the time has come to adopt common, international rules on cryptocurrencies with the help of the United Nations. “Most countries are actively exploring the possibility to adapt their regulations to the current configuration of the financial system. At the same time, the disconnected actions of different states will lead to inefficiency. It is necessary to develop general rules,” he insisted, quoted by Zakon.kz .\nDuring the Astana Economic Forum, Nazarbayev noted that Kazakhstan’s own project to issue an assets-backed cryptocurrency called G-Global has won institutional support from international organizations. The initiative “has been mentioned on multiple occasions during the G20 summit . Last week the Council of Foreign Ministers at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes more than 50 nations, adopted a resolution to support it,” the president revealed.\nKazakhstani officials have previously said that G-Global will be designed as a crypto “backed by assets, not just trust.” These assets have not been specified so far but the Central Asian country is rich in natural resources. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the region , generating 60% of its GDP, primarily through the oil and natural gas industry.\nRecent reports that Kazakhstan’s central bank is preparing legislation to ban the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies, as well as crypto mining, have been dismissed by representatives of the local crypto community. According to Leonid Muravjov, VP at the Blockchain and Crypto Technology Association of Kazakhstan, the government is actually spending huge amounts of money to digitize the economy, which is currently heavily reliant on the export of mineral resources. Kazakhstan and Belarus to Cooperate on Blockchain Astana and Minsk intend to strengthen their ties in the field of blockchain implementation. Kazakhstan and Belarus have signed a memorandum of cooperation that will allow experts from the two former Soviet republics to exchange experience and improve their competitiveness on the world stage through wider adoption of new technologies. Both countries are members of the Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU ).\n“The bottom line is that this (blockchain) is a multinational technology, and the development of some real solutions, both at state level and in the private sector, does not make sense in the context of a single state. The memorandum aims to develop the most optimal solutions through exchange of experience and personnel, and to share already working solutions based on blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies,” said Stanislav Baskov, Director of the Belarussian Distributed Ledger Technologies Association.\nAccording to a press release by Astana Hub , Kazakhstan’s IT Park, the agreement was signed during the international expo TIBO – 2018 in Belarus. It would allow Kazakhstan to take advantage of the Belarusian experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency integration. Recently, Minsk legalized crypto-related activities for entities registered with its Hi-Tech Park with a presidential decree that came into force on March 28. Iran and Russia to Create Crypto Alternative to SWIFT\nRecognizing the opportunity to minimize dependence on the US dollar, Iranian authorities have turned their attention to cryptocurrencies. Iran’s central bank has commenced work on proposals to use cryptocurrency in international trade, as requested by the parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs, Interfax reported. “Cryptocurrencies offer a good opportunity to circumvent the use of the dollar, and also replace the SWIFT system,” said Mohamad Reza Purebrahimi, who heads the commission. Teheran has established cooperation with Russia on the matter following a meeting with the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, Dmitriy Mezentsev. Purebrahimi said that the two countries may be the first to use cryptocurrency in bilateral trade transactions.\n“Against the backdrop of US pressure, the expansion of settlements in national currencies, as well as the possible use of payment systems like [the Russian] Mir and the Iranian Shetab is promising,” Mezentsev commented. According to official sources quoted in Moscow, Russia may put its version of SWIFT, the SPFS , on blockchain as early as next year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the highlights in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

The pair has to move above the $8,500 resistance the 100 hourly simple moving average to gain momentum.\nBitcoin price is struggling to break the $8,500 resistance against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may trade in a range above $8,200 before the next move. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter forming a base around the $8,080 , bitcoin price started an upside recovery against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair managed to move above the $8,200 resistance level to post intraday gains. It also broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low. There were a few positive signs above the $8,200 level, but the price struggled to break a major barrier at $8,500.\nThe 100 hourly simple moving average at $8,500 prevented gains . There were two attempts by buyers to break the stated $8,500 resistance, but they failed. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low also acted as a resistance. It seems like there is a breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is currently declining and testing the triangle support at $8,200. Should it break the triangle support, there could be a downside move towards the $8,080 low.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly struggling near $8,500. A proper break above this is needed for a push towards the $8,750 level. On the flip side, the $8,080 low is a decent support followed by the $8,000 handle.\nLooking at the technical indicators :\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI has moved back below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,080 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T11:16:37.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3a3166a5782e65b9f051bc0d14c817bafc3e0df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYRZ5FmDp4pCsYOWEbxR6D3M1Pl3jXjyxthCau.tehDz9FiZ9bToKRf2J6GM4UdeNkS2FS1qyYzI__QSa9jtyx.KgCdjaoBW.7_eLrTpBnZk5", "site_full": "mymixfm.com", "site": "mymixfm.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | News | MIX-FM", "title_full": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | News | MIX-FM", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.056, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/17/2018-05-17T191021Z_1_LYNXNPEE4G1M2-OUSBS_RTROPTP_3_BUSINESS-US-CRYPTO-CURRENCY-INDEX.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3a3166a5782e65b9f051bc0d14c817bafc3e0df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYRZ5FmDp4pCsYOWEbxR6D3M1Pl3jXjyxthCau.tehDz9FiZ9bToKRf2J6GM4UdeNkS2FS1qyYzI__QSa9jtyx.KgCdjaoBW.7_eLrTpBnZk5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | News | MIX-FM", "text": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index Thursday, May 17, 2018 3:10 p.m. EDT Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTE\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com .\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:57:43.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aba87a9a084ba478b8fa3b9c85cce8e4b023fe15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTX1o96V.caSqbJMQ59ed9TicCByN4l4EBCU2MBEKIKE6kdXUg67lc9Yvtjjtw.v82Qh4EBnaKRqZVPdy3rTT0bcZs8H1F9PYo-", "site_full": "crypto-lines.com", "site": "crypto-lines.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jack Dorsey strongly believes Bitcoin is the currency of the future - Crypto-Lines", "title_full": "Jack Dorsey strongly believes Bitcoin is the currency of the future - Crypto-Lines", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://crypto-lines.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jack.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aba87a9a084ba478b8fa3b9c85cce8e4b023fe15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTX1o96V.caSqbJMQ59ed9TicCByN4l4EBCU2MBEKIKE6kdXUg67lc9Yvtjjtw.v82Qh4EBnaKRqZVPdy3rTT0bcZs8H1F9PYo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Basil Kimathi", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jack Dorsey strongly believes Bitcoin is the currency of the future - Crypto-Lines", "text": "Basil Kimathi 0 Comments Bitcoin , consensus conference , Jack Dorsey\nJack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO was speaking to a crowd of crypto enthusiasts during the ongoing consensus conference when he said he strongly believes Bitcoin is the currency of the future.\nDorsey, the CEO of Square Inc. and Twitter was addressing crypto enthusiasts on Wednesday at the Consensus meeting and he says:\n“The internet deserves a native currency; it will have a native currency. I don’t know if it’ll be Bitcoin or not, but I hope it will be.”\nThe consensus conference is hosted by Coindesk and it’s currently ongoing in New York City. It focuses on blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\nThis is not the first time Dorsey has spoken fondly of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Back in 2016, he tweeted that he would love to see cryptocurrencies thrive.\nAt Square, Dorsey has helped promote cryptocurrencies. In 2014 the company started allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin. Fast forward to today and the San Francisco based company is set to launch Bitcoin trading on its Cash App. The app allows users to send money to family and friends.\nHowever, Dorsey says not everyone at Square was so enthusiastic about the move. He adds the decision was heatedly debated among key members of the company.\n“A number of people were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier.”\nHe adds that even today there is debate and even fights on the topic and some of Square’s board members are still opposed to virtual currencies.\nEarlier this month the company reported that it had made $34.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 selling Bitcoin. However, the report also indicates the company spent $33.9 million buying the tokens which means the company made a profit of only $200,000.\nDorsey ended his speech by saying he strongly believes Bitcoin is the currency of the future and work has to be done to educate regulators and the SEC on why this new technology is important.\nDo you agree with Jack Dorsey that Bitcoin is the currency of the future?

Image: Coinbase\nCryptocurrency is going legit in a big way.\nLeading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is going after institutional investors with four new major products, all of which cater to the needs of professionals and big institutions, making it easier for them to trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. SEE ALSO: Facebook is working on its own cryptocurrency\nThe new products address many of the issues that big investors such as hedge funds face when trying to enter the cryptocurrency market, providing liquidity, safe storage of assets, quality support and advanced products such as OTC (over-the-counter) and margin trading.\nIf institutional investors take the bait — and judging by announcements from banking giants such as Goldman Sachs , they will — Coinbase’s new tools will clear the path for an even larger outpouring of money into cryptocurrencies.\nCoinbase Custody, launched in partnership with “an SEC-regulated broker-dealer,” provides safe storage of cryptoassets, paired with third-party auditing. Coinbase claims it’ll draw on its experience of storing more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency to make this the “most secure crypto storage solution available.”\nCoinbase Prime is a platform with all the bells and whistles institutional investors are used to, and by the end of the year it should have advanced tools such as margin trading, algorithmic orders and multi-user permissions. Note that individual investors should use Coinbase’s trading platform GDAX; Prime is for institutions and professionals only.\nCoinbase Markets is a centralized liquidity pool for all Coinbase products, which, besides Coinbase’s digital wallet and exchange, include trading platform GDAX and now Prime. This product will be headquartered in Coinbase’s new office in Chicago.\nCoinbase claims that more than 100 hedge funds announced plans to trade/invest in cryptocurrency in the last few months alone.\nFinally, the Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group will work from Coinbase’s New York City office to provide support to clients including research and market operations.\nThis is a major upgrade to Coinbase’s product lineup, which has so far been mostly oriented toward individual investors. “There is clear demand from institutional clients and financial services professionals for more specific solutions with regard to cryptocurrencies that address their sophisticated needs,” Adam White, Vice President and General Manager of Coinbase Institutional, said in a statement. Coinbase claims that more than 100 hedge funds announced plans to trade/invest in cryptocurrency in the last few months alone.\nCoinbase was reportedly adding more than 100,000 users per day in late 2017, when the cryptocurrency craze — and Bitcoin price levels — was going off the charts. The company reportedly had more than $1 billion in revenue in 2017, and valued itself at $8 billion in April 2018.\nDisclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.

This is even as Beijing tightened grip on cryptocurrency trading , mining, exchanges and equipment.\nReuters reported that Canaan supplies world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power. This was according to an interview with chairman Jianping Kong last month. The company expected to grow propelled by China’s demand for domestic chip industry. It was valued at $500 million as at mid-2017.\nHowever, the valuation of its IPO is not set yet due to lack of companies. It can be compared with and due to the fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies. The company’s float is sponsored by Credit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley.\nOn its part, Ebang delisted from the China ’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board in readiness for Hong Kong listing.\nMany companies seek public listing in a variety of ways in many countries. This include mergers, take-overs and acquisitions. Miners Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining have partnered with other companies to see these mergers list. Genesis Mining partnered with Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company based in Canada and the latter was renamed to Hive Blockchain.\nAustralia-based DigitalBTC went public after a merger with Macro Energy, and thus listed on the public exchange.

JPMorgan Trader Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe bitcoin price entered another bearish trend this week after failing to pierce $10,000 earlier in the month. The flagship cryptocurrency now sits more than 58 percent below the all-time high it set in December, but one former JPMorgan trader remains confident that it will trade above $20,000 before the year is out.\nDanny Masters, who now serves as chairman of investment firm CoinShares, told CNBC that, despite last year’s parabolic run-up, the cryptocurrency is still largely bereft of the tools that institutional investors need to operate effectively in the nascent markets.\n“We need to see this structure continue to build,” Masters said of the cryptocurrency industry, adding:\n“We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.”\nThat’s been a common refrain from investment professionals who operate in institutional circles, and it wasn’t Masters’ only complaint.\n“We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle,” he continued. “And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.”\n“We’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet,” he said.\nHowever, the industry — which to date has largely been comprised of retail investors — is gradually building out its institutional infrastructure.\nAs CCN reported , retail brokerage giant Coinbase this week unveiled a robust line of institutional products, ranging from trading tools to custodial services. Meanwhile, Japanese holding company Nomura partnered with cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger to launch a cryptocurrency consortium that will develop products and services for institutions.\nOther mainstream firms are preparing to dip their toes into the ecosystem as well. Goldman Sachs will offer its clients a type of bitcoin futures product, while Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) — the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) — is holding serious discussions about opening a bitcoin exchange.\nThese developments, Masters predicted, will propel the bitcoin price to a new all-time high in 2018.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny masters", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinshares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:52:23.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89691e432efeae4c98512b6c128b9b1d146408bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVJxlCrlBUKR2kc_Ee8GYHQ31gUuHoVU9ltY61NJbHRodZT5O2UhXpRc5zhF2YXglhrK6o9UAYEXBuFvDbkiY21Q--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitfinex Starts Sharing Customer Tax Data with Authorities - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Bitfinex Starts Sharing Customer Tax Data with Authorities - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitfinex-tax.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89691e432efeae4c98512b6c128b9b1d146408bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVJxlCrlBUKR2kc_Ee8GYHQ31gUuHoVU9ltY61NJbHRodZT5O2UhXpRc5zhF2YXglhrK6o9UAYEXBuFvDbkiY21Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kai Sedgwick", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitfinex Starts Sharing Customer Tax Data with Authorities - Bitcoin News", "text": "6068 Bitfinex Starts Sharing Customer Tax Data with Authorities\nBitfinex, an exchange famed for its opaque banking arrangements, has begun ordering its users to submit their tax details. The platform, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, a known tax haven, will retain this information and may share it with tax authorities in their customers’ jurisdiction. The news has caused quite a stir.\nAlso read: Thailand Waives 7% VAT for Individual Cryptocurrency Investors Bitfinex Wants Your Tax Details\nIn an email issued to a portion of its users, Bitfinex has outlined a new KYC policy. Not content with knowing the identity and location of its customers, it now wants their tax details. It has been stated that this is to accord with local laws in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) where the exchange is registered. The platform’s tax data gathering won’t stop there however: it notes that the BVI government “may then exchange that information with the tax authorities of the customer’s country of residence”.\nUp until a few months ago, Bitfinex didn’t even enforce basic KYC for its users. It’s now gone from being one of the laxest major exchanges to one of the most regimented, with a tax sharing policy that surpasses anything enacted by the likes of Coinbase or Bittrex. After Bitfinex’ new policy was called out on Twitter, the exchange clarified its position, explaining: “We have not sent this message to all users. We have deliberately targeted users that we believe have an obligation to self-disclose. If a user has _not_ received a message from us, she need _not_ self-certify anything to us at this time.” There appears to be an inference, however, that all users will eventually be obliged to comply. Bitfinex Users Plan a Boycott\nPredictably, a number of Bitfinex customers have stated their desire to boycott the platform and take their trading elsewhere. Due to increased regulation, coupled with the transparency that is inherent to blockchain technology, cryptocurrency users are already among the most heavily scrutinized investors in the world. Many feel that Bitfinex’ latest policy, regardless of its legal basis, is a step too far.

Wave C has clear subwaves of 5 and thus its label is well qualified. The recent bounce was also in a five wave impulse (white) and price is currently correcting as a requisite next step. Many years ago, I started combining chart patterns with Elliott Waves because EW doesn’t always show the fullest picture. Chart patterns can fill in alot of missing information regarding the state of sentiment especially when EW is at an impass or has too many alternate counts. The below chart shows a potential Cup & Handle pattern. The handle is being formed and could be nearly complete. Price needs to decisively breach the upper white line and start impulsing upwards in order for the trend reversal to be maintained. Bitcoin has a similar pattern of a downward wedge and a Cup & Handle pattern. This similarity might be reflective of many WPR holders also holding BTC; hence the uniformity of sentiment.

Announced on May 14, the nascent cryptocurrency investment platform will launch its two index funds MiX10 and MiX10 Institutional. From Retail to Institutional Investment\nAs blockchain applications and integration continue to pervade industries worldwide, retail and institutional investors alike have grown to demand better instruments for measuring the overall cryptocurrency market. Founded in 2012, IronChain Capital is a San-Francisco-based digital assets investment firm.\nEmerging this year, cryptocurrency indexes like the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) and Coinbase Index Fund have made their way into the open market – allowing accredited investors a way to measure and invest in a diversified portfolio of digital assets.\nFollowing this trend, new outlets for institutional investments have developed – including the MiX10 funds launched just two days ago by IronChain Capital . About IronChain Capital\nUsing a basket of up to 10 of the top cryptocurrencies weighted by market cap, the MiX10 and MiX10 Institutional funds offer accredited investors a mutual fund-like instrument for long-term holdings. The IronChain Capital MiX10 Cryptocurrency Index Fund aggregates the top cryptocurrency funds by market capitalization.\nDescribed on their website ,\n“Iron Capital was created with the vision of applying a rigorous framework similar to the S&P 500 to the cryptocurrency industry.”\nAccording to this blog post by founder Jonathan Benassaya, IronChain seeks to resolve current issues surrounding cryptocurrency investment through improvements in liquidity and valuation.\nThe recently launched investment platform advertises a 1% management fee, daily liquidity, and institutional-grade security through partnerships with Kingdom Trust, Ledger, and Xapo. In addition, the funds utilize a hybrid liquidity pool drawing from both exchanges and OTC desks.\nIn an effort to streamline the investment process, Benassaya describes their inspiration for the new cryptocurrency investment platform here :\n“IronChain Capital lowers the economical barrier by taking away the high price tag and eliminating many of the complications associated with investing, such as picking the right digital assets, trading them and having to worry about safekeeping them.” Major Cryptocurrencies Boosted by Index Funds\nWith the rise of funds like those of IronChain and Coinbase , a new facet of opportunity for major institutional investments in cryptocurrency are made available. Related Story: Coinbase Announces Cryptocurrency Index Fund\nThe normalization of cryptocurrency investing has evolved into structures similar to those used to invest in traditional asset classes, establishing a secure platform for future investors to join the market.\nGiven that these funds track the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin become backed by the pooled funds that invest in them – boosting their overall valuation and serving as a cushion for their future growth.\nCryptocurrency continues to attract new retail and institutional funding, and we can only expect more outlets for investment to become available as the industry matures.

Telegraph Reporters The ethereum cryptocurrency - © 2017 Bloomberg Finance LP More Ethereum is a rising star in the cryptocurrency world. It has quickly become the second largest digital currency in just over two years, booming in value and spurring the rise of hundreds of new rivals to Bitcoin. Launched in 2015, the value of ether (ethereum's currency) has increased rapidly. It hit highs of $1400 in January before showing intense volatility, slumping to less than $400 and then rebounding to about $700. But to put it all in context, last year saw near continual growth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin. Ethereum started the year trading for about $10 per coin. What is ethereum? Ether is the second most valuable form of digital money after Bitcoin in terms of market value. The technology it runs on is called the ethereum blockchain, which was first described by the then 19-year-old bitcoin programmer Vitalik Buterin in 2013. The ether cryptocurrency has rocketed in popularity - and price - in recent months. The total value of all the ether in circulation as of December 27, 2017 was $73 billion at $736 per coin, against the $268 billion value of all the $15,000 Bitcoins . Buterin envisaged ethereum as an improvement on bitcoin. Like Bitcoin , it is a decentralised payment network, with its own cryptograpic currency, that allows anonymous payments to be sent across the internet without the need for a bank or other third party. Coded transactions are stored in a decentralised ledger, the blockchain, and are visible for everyone on the network to see. How does it differ from bitcoin? As the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, ethereum has inevitably drawn comparisons to it. Its rapid rise has also led to claims of a bubble. But advocates say ethereum has several advantages over bitcoin that make it more useful. The first is that ethereum allows for \"blocks\", the records of cryptocurrency transactions, that can be created much more quickly than bitcoin. While bitcoin has been more widely adopted by online retailers and even some physical stores, ethereum's fans believe its efficiency makes it better for transactions, rather than storing value. The Ethereum logo More But the major advantage of ethereum is that the technology allows for third party applications, not just the currency, to run on the network. Bitcoin's appeal lies in money that is not controlled by any one party and does not have to run through a central server, but ethereum allows not just money, but all sorts of other things to run on the network. If you store files on a cloud storage service like Dropbox, you are trusting Dropbox to take care of it, but on a decentralised storage network you are putting your faith in others who are using it and have an interest in maintaining it. A number of apps are being built on Ethereum, and the network is also being used by start-ups to raise money with initial coin offerings , which exchange ether or other currencies for special \"tokens\" that grant access to a service. What affects its price? The price of ethereum has risen rapidly this year, alongside Bitcoin. When first launched, it held steady at around $10 for the first 18 months. Then in March 2017 it started to climb steadily, hitting a peak of $395 in June before plummeting to $155 a month later and then rising again. In December 2017 almost doubled to more than $800. Story Continues The rise was in no small part thanks to a spike in the value of bitcoin, which has fuelled interest in online currencies. It has also received high profile backing in recent months from large organisations. Its dramatic dips in the past have been related to security concerns and general market wobbles, including sell-offs by big investors or a rush of news. In July the price of ethereum dropped more than 20 per cent in a day following a drop in confidence and a rumour, later proved false, that founder Buterin had died. Bitcoin | Your essential guide More Who created ethereum? One of the biggest mysteries in the technology world is who created bitcoin. The enigmatic pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto has plagued cryptocurrency users and journalists who have sought to unmask the inventor. Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's creator has always been in the open. A Canadian citizen born in Russia, Buterin published his idea for the digital currency in 2013 when he was 19, and went on to set it up over the next two years. Buterin was mathematically gifted from a young age and won a bronze medal at the International Olympiad in Informatics in 2012. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin Credit: Romanpoet/Wikimedia More Buterin started writing for specialist bitcoin websites after hearing about the cryptocurrency from his father when he was 17. He proposed the idea for ethereum in 2013 as a \"decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one\". After receiving a Thiel Fellowship worth $100,000 in 2014 he dropped out of the University of Waterloo. Buterin and Canadian entrepreneur Joseph Lubin co-founded Ethereum Switzerland GmbH later that year. How many people use ethereum? There are more than 15 million cryptocurrency wallets that hold ether, according to Etherscan . Wallets are the equivalent of accounts for ethereum and individuals can have more than one. The number of wallets with ether in has dramatically increased in recent months, up from 1.6 million in May. What can I spend it on? Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is known for being largely anonymous and secure against fraud and theft, as its transactions are logged in a decentralised ledger. Users can transact large sums without having to pay fees because middle men, such as banks, are cut out. Ether can be spent in a handful of online stores and with cryptocurrency Mastercard and Visa \"credit cards\" . They can also be stored in online wallets in the hope the currency will gain in value and their investment will accumulate into a lucrative sum. Should I invest in ethereum? Ethereum's price soared last year. But throughout its rise many conventional analysts warned that investors could get burned by the volatility of cryptocurrencies. They have been proved right during the first quarter of 2018 with huge losses. But that could make now a good time to buy again.

He is very positive on Bitcoin Cash and predicts that the coin will hold a value which is as high as Bitcoin’s.\nRoger Ver is a well-known cryptocurrency investor. He is one of the first people to invest in Bitcoin and is known for his site Bitcoin.com. He has high hopes for cryptocurrency and believes that it will become the future of currency.\nIn the interview, Roger is questioned about the Fork to Bitcoin Cash. He comments that it was an upgrade to BCH resulting in increasing the number of transactions for the coin. The main reason for the upgrade was to make the coin more accessible to investors. The upgrade makes BCH’s transactions speed 30 times greater than Bitcoin’s.\nHe also says that BCH has more utility and can be used as money in various countries. Countries like Bangkok accept BCH for food, coffee, and other things. He also advises business startups to start using Bitcoin Cash.\nThe interviewer then proceeds to question the liquidity of Bitcoin Cash and how would it rise in value. Roger then replies that BCH has a higher market cap than what Bitcoin did a year ago and hence shows a bullish sign. He also says that companies are coming up with new innovations based on Bitcoin Cash and not Bitcoin.\nHe then proceeds to criticize Bitcoin saying that it is slow and unreliable. He praises the developers of BCH saying that they work hard to make BCH successful, as they follow the same path which made BTC successful.\nRoger Ver says:\n“I am very bullish on Bitcoin Cash, just like I was when I was the very first investor of Bitcoin in 2011.”\nAnother interviewer asks whether Bitcoin Cash can be used in day to day life like in America just like it is in Thailand. Roger replies by stating that companies like Coinbase are already using BCH to accept payments with Bitpay as the payment processor to accept payments.\nHe says the reason why BCH is more popular is that it can be stored and be spent as cash, something the top cryptocurrencies lack.\nWhen asked to give his thoughts on BCH surpassing BTC, Roger says a lot of people are already lobbying BCH and he witnessed an exchange which supported BCH. He says BCH is growing fast and furiously.\nHe gives an example of how BCH surpasses BTC stating that he received his first Bitcoin on a site called Bitcoin Faucet, but now it is not possible. It is possible to receive $0.15 worth BCH on a site called free.bitcoin.com. He predicts Bitcoin will be 10 to 20 times higher than the current value and BCH will be 2 times more value in a year.\nRoger Ver says:\n“All of the new innovation is taking place on Bitcoin Cash, it’s no longer taking place on Bitcoin.”\nBehc39 a Twitter user says:\n“1. Who is that idiot (besides Roger) saying Bitcoin Core? 2. Roger assumes she will call it an HF so he sticks to his canned response saying it was an upgrade, even though she used the term upgrade. 3.

Now, he’s similarly-bearish on a new asset class: cryptocurrency.\nEisman, whose career is chronicled in The Big Short , told CNBC that he has yet to meet anyone who can persuasively argue that cryptocurrencies have social utility.\nHe said:\n“I’m not an expert on cryptocurrency, but I have my doubts about it. My doubts center on the fact that, ‘What’s the social utility of cryptocurrency?’ I’m not talking about blockchain. The technology, I think, has real value. But currency markets are the most liquid, most efficient markets, probably of any markets that exist.”\nWhile conceding that there are a few exceptions to this rule — Venezuela, for instance — the Neuberger Berman portfolio manager argued that in developed countries the only use cases for cryptocurrency are speculative investing and money laundering.\n“I think the social utility, at least in developed countries, is extremely small. The only thing I can really figure out the usage of it is that it’s good for speculation, and it’s good for money laundering.\nThe interview marked the second time in this week alone that Eisman had bashed bitcoin. As CCN reported , he said at an industry convention in Hong Kong that he believes the asset class has no legitimate purpose and that he won’t touch it.\nEven so, Eisman reiterated that he has no plans to make bitcoin his next “big short,” both because he does not specialize in currency trading and because he does not believe it is possible to assign bitcoin a fair market value.\n“It’s like arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin,” he said. “I have no idea how to value it, and I don’t think anybody else does either.”\nFeatured Image from YouTube ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuberger berman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:56:28.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83a567614b38bcc79f4ddf83df0340d0011f8c28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ41AXY.jKyFLsZGaeXO1YzKU4GPFnpWEgxXc1x4yH85_r76mDXRm8M1NwzmGLtNpNMFVq0UH3PyySbciIMftZiLbOz56rsswJI5HTO4kMx6UIlptTY4F_yUw--", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto investors advises hold bitcoin cash and ethereum, sell ripple", "title_full": "Crypto investors advises hold bitcoin cash and ethereum, sell ripple", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/01/17/104950133-GettyImages-871795390-1.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 477, "comments": 0, "shares": 477}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83a567614b38bcc79f4ddf83df0340d0011f8c28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ41AXY.jKyFLsZGaeXO1YzKU4GPFnpWEgxXc1x4yH85_r76mDXRm8M1NwzmGLtNpNMFVq0UH3PyySbciIMftZiLbOz56rsswJI5HTO4kMx6UIlptTY4F_yUw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kellie Ell", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto investors advises hold bitcoin cash and ethereum, sell ripple", "text": "With so many digital coin options out there, it can be difficult for investors to know how to navigate the cryptocurrency universe.\nRan Neu-Ner, founder of Onchain Capital and host of CNBC Africa's \"Crypto Trader,\" offered a few tips to \" Fast Money \" traders on Thursday.

Dorsey: ‘We Could be in Every App Store Instead of Five’\nJack Dorsey, the founder and CEO of Square and the co-founder and CEO of social media platform Twitter, was speaking at the Consensus conference today in New York.\n“The internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.”\nDorsey is of the opinion that the use of the number one digital currency or another altcoin as a global payment would lower the barrier for the payment company to enter new markets, reports CNBC . He added:\n“If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.”\nHe stated that as the company deals with fiat currency it had to approach the market differently, find a unique banking partner, and work with different regulators.\nThis isn’t the first time that Dorsey has been bullish on the future of Bitcoin. In March, it was reported that the Square CEO said that he believed the digital currency would become the globally accepted ‘ single currency ‘ of the Internet within the next 10 years.\nIn November, Square began the introduction of Bitcoin buying and selling options on Square Cash, the mobile payment app developed by Square, for a small section of their users. Since then the payment company has rolled out additional features for its users, which now sees them able to buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin with the app. Dorsey has also committed personal funds to Lightning Labs as the team continues its work on the Bitcoin scaling proposal known as the Lightning Network.\nEarlier today it was reported that Square Cash is growing at a faster rate compared to PayPal’s Venmo, according to Nomura Instinet. Analyst Dan Dolev said that with the roughly 28 million downloads, the number of Square Cash downloads was just one million fewer than Venmo’s levels.\nIn a note to clients, Dolev stated that:\n“Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017.”\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Square reportedly sold $34.1 million in Bitcoin; however, it spent $33.9 million purchasing the cryptocurrency, meaning it’s adjusted revenue amounted to $200,000.

The two sat down for a fireside chat to discuss the future of bitcoin in regard to its ease of use.\nDorsey founded Square to solve a critical problem for his friend, who was selling handmade glass art and could not accept credit card payments. Rather than following a traditional path of credit card processing, Square's mission became to enable entrepreneurs and individuals to send and receive money easily and instantly. Its services include buying, selling, and paying in bitcoin ; the process is meant to be seamless, without recipients knowing when payments are even made in bitcoin.\nDorsey went on to say: \"The internet needs its own native, global currency. I don't know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be.\"\nDorsey and Stark have been working together on improving the speed of bitcoin transactions. The Lightning Network, developed by Lightning Labs , allows individuals to transact with each other off-chain for a period of time, and settle their final balances on the blockchain when they close their payment channels (like when you settle a tab at a bar, rather than paying after every drink). This prevents congestion on the bitcoin blockchain and allows for much faster transactions.\nWhen asked about her opinion on cryptocurrency's future, Stark responded that she is \"really seeing the value of having the ability to transact easily without central bodies.\" The two leaders shared their vision for helping to financially connect individuals and provide them with the ability to transact with anyone in the world quickly, simply, and affordably.\nIt's important to note, however, that Square currently does not accept bitcoin as a form of payment for its products.

Are they, as enthusiasts would have us believe, fed up with credit card fees and prefer the settlement speed of new currencies like bitcoin and bitcoin cash? Or are they already enthusiasts themselves, who want to create a new economy? We sat down to chat with Mike Verweyst, owner of the Two Dogs Taproom in central Tokyo, to ask about his decision-making process.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts\nDo Small Businesses Really Like Bitcoin?\nTwo Dogs Taproom is a restaurant and craft beer bar in Roppongi, one of Tokyo’s liveliest entertainment districts. It’s also in a small strip that was frequented and targeted by bitcoiners in the earlier years in an effort to create a district where visitors could choose a variety of establishments within a small area to spend their BTC.\nBitcoin’s fortunes in the area (like in the wider world) have ebbed and flowed since then. Four businesses there have hosted various kinds of bitcoin ATMs over the years, though unreliable technology and new regulations have put a damper on that trend in Japan. Verweyst initially used Coinkite point-of-sale machines, and was forced to change processors when that company “pivoted” away from selling and supporting them.\nWe hear of many (perhaps too many) businesses who announce they’re accepting bitcoin payments, only for disappointed punters to turn up months later and find it ended long ago.\nVerweyst still accepts bitcoin and bitcoin cash, and does a roaring trade when Two Dogs Taproom hosts either the BTC or BCH meetup nights. Watch the full interview above to hear the whole story.\nAre cryptos still useful for daily purchases like this? How often do you pay for meals with bitcoin?

Bitcoin and Electricity Usage That said, determining exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy in the future, is not straightforward. According to blockchain specialist Alex de Vries , who works at the tax advising firm PwC in the Netherlands: “We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.” The estimates, based on de Vries’ background in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts — as noted, almost as much electricity as Ireland. Another comparison puts a single transaction as using about as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in an entire month. One of the biggest factors that contributes to the coin’s high electricity usage is also an inherent part of its design. Since its inception Bitcoin’s decentralized consensus has been enabled by its proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, and the mining machines that perform this ‘work’ need tremendous amounts of energy to do so. According to research published in April by equity analyst Charlie Chan and his team at Morgan Stanley, the key price point for Bitcoin mining profitability is $8,600 . As per their simulation, if the coin can’t stay above $8,600, many Bitcoin miners will likely find it unprofitable to keep creating the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s Energy Cost Moving Forward Moving forward, the electricity needed to operate the Bitcoin network is only going to increase. By the end of 2018, de Vries predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts — as much electricity as the European country of Austria. Looking further ahead, if the price of Bitcoin continues to increase as some experts predict , de Vries believes the network could someday consume as much as 5% of the world’s total electricity, a tenfold increase from today’s 0.5%. “To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. Another consideration environmentally is Bitcoin’s carbon footprint. The problem is that much of the coin’s network is fueled by coal-fired power plants in China , where electricity is produced at very low rates, but the impact on the environment is more marked. Based on ‘conservative’ estimates from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index , the carbon footprint for each unique Bitcoin transaction totals almost 450 kilograms of CO2, which translates to 32,898 kilotons annually for the entire network.

REUTE\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com .\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:14:54.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b46fd15dc48fd84500fe7ef885f5a0b0eda10dea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFuzeBfWyhmrRnuwkuSyf21luPOd6GEarwcV34cTT05gNOW9Wm1CqffkAIgK_izMCUs48DAa3pq2UO", "site_full": "www.cryptocurrenciescoin.com", "site": "cryptocurrenciescoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May 2018", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cryptocurrenciescoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin_may2018.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b46fd15dc48fd84500fe7ef885f5a0b0eda10dea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFuzeBfWyhmrRnuwkuSyf21luPOd6GEarwcV34cTT05gNOW9Wm1CqffkAIgK_izMCUs48DAa3pq2UO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May 2018", "text": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May 2018 May 17, 2018 tweet\nBitcoin value discovered help above $8,000 and recouped pleasantly against the US Dollar.\nThere is a breakout design shaping with protection close $8,500 on the hourly graph of the BTC/USD combine (information sustain from Kraken).\nThe combine needs to move over the $8,500 protection the 100 hourly basic moving normal to pick up energy.\nBitcoin cost is attempting to break the $8,500 protection against the US Dollar.

I'm particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don't think we are ready. So I'm still paying attention to Alipay ... to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don't care about Bitcoin.\"\nLast year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln.

Later, in April, Alibaba subsidiary Taobao banned all ICO-related advertising from its platform.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been quoted in the media recently.\nIn their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the “Oracle of Omaha” has a general distaste for bitcoin.\nFor those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as “rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual shareholder meeting. The Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets\nOne of the key counterarguments to Buffett’s assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna.\n“Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven’t taken the time to really understand what’s going on here,” said Wilson. “If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you’ll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn’t exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we’re going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.”\nThe LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the “Web 2.0” phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed “Web 3.0.” This Is Very Different From Buffett’s World\nWilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett’s approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains.\nTalking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them.\n“The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,” said Wilson.\nIn short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market.\n“There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we’ve ever seen,” Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem.\nWhile Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved.\nAdditionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.

Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts - as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five per cent of the world's electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins - a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power .\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said. 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/bitcoin-to-use-0-5-per-cent-of-worlds-electricity-by-year-end/articleshow/64202618.cms&title=Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "positive"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:50:56.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "441945c8e682b9c9267f05d067ef072d1ac50247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8fFwUAeeDLvVtMbzYejh1I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "441945c8e682b9c9267f05d067ef072d1ac50247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8fFwUAeeDLvVtMbzYejh1I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

As attendance more than quadrupled from 2017, to over 9,000 attendees, there was plenty of hype and heavy anticipation of the positive effect Consensus 2018 would have on cryptocurrency markets.\nUnfortunately, the conclusion of Consesnsus 2018 has not had the positive impact expected. Since local highs from May 15, the global cryptocurrency market has net a loss of over 10%, and this trend has not yet shown signs of slowing. In contrast, the previous three conferences had spawned massive bull runs, led by the more than four times growth in the weeks following Consensus 2017.\nAfter yesterday’s conclusion, many participants suggested the conference was a complete mess. Ran by controversial crypto news outlet, Coindesk, attendees suggested that the tickets, which cost an average of about US$2,000 a piece, were taken up by crypto celebrities, enthusiasts, and snake oil salesmen, rather than the inventors and innovators that truly drive the future of the cryptocurrency space. These complaints were accompanied by a consensus that the booking for the event was completely mishandled. Twitter erupted with pictures and videos of clear signs of over saturation of guests. Check in lines at a local Hilton, for example, wrapped for hours. At one point, elevators at the conference in one area were rendered unusable because maximum occupancy was reached on each floor. TFW eating at a 2000$ conference next to the toilets #consensus2018 pic.twitter.com/8SWKDp8Yoq\n— Ambroid (@anambroid) May 15, 2018\nHowever, others suggest that the conference itself is a poor representation of the weight of Consensus. As is the case every year, alternative arguments suggest that the true impact of this massive convention are the negotiations and partnerships that form behind-the-scenes, at the after parties and private events situated around the conference. These individuals also go on to suggest that the recent dips are not alarming or indicative of any sort of failure. The Consensus event of past years have also seen momentary dips either during or immediately after conclusions, and the true impact will be seen in the coming days and weeks.\nRegardless, the drops seen are certainly not insignificant. Leading up to the conference, Bitcoin appeared as if it was looking to challenge the US$9,000 benchmark once more. After a mid-conference high above $8,800, however, the price movement has redirected, and Bitcoin’s current price of $8,070 is inching ever closer to the $8,000 support level. Whether Bitcoin can maintain a price above that psychological level or not may very well determine the near future for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets as a whole.\nRegardless of immediate price movements, the fundamentals and developments that enable the cryptocurrency space are growing each and every day. While the fluctuations each day may encapsulate a short term uncertainty, the long term inevitability can best be predicted as a radically prosperous future.

However, he also points out a few things that need to happen before that.\nIn an interview for CNBC, the chairman of the popular investment company, CoinShares, stood firm that Bitcoin’s price will surge once again in a manner similar to the one in 2017. Yet, he outlines that there are two things that need to happen before that – better structuring as well as a comprehensive life cycle after Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Enhanced Structure – What Does it Mean?\nAs for the first premise for a potential Bitcoin price surge, Masters outlines that the structure of cryptocurrencies has to continue to build. In his words:\nWe need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build, […] We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.\nWith this, Masters hints that there are plenty of ways for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go prior to reaching a state of maturity. In other words, the field is still in a rather early stage of its life cycle. To build on to that point, the Chairman of CoinShares says:\nWe’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet.\nA lot of things have to come together to solidify the structure of cryptocurrencies. For one, clear regulations have to be laid down. Cryptocurrencies need to be defined. Governments across the world seem to be torn in the way they see them. While some countries like Thailand have already stepped forward to regulate cryptocurrencies as digital assets, others are still to take serious legislative actions. ICOs – An Important Part\nMasters also stressed the importance of ICOs, and, most importantly, the way they turn out after the fundraising event is finished:\nWe need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle, […] And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\nThe statements do have a lot of merit behind them. As it turns out, almost half of the ICOs didn’t have any development work done before the ICO itself. What is more, it also seems that the post ICO performance is also poor due to the lack of value of the assets which are being sold. In other words, the tokens people are investing in are not really needed for the system, as noted by a study from ICORating .\nWith such improvements in the cryptocurrency sphere showing that the space is maturing, Masters believes that a rally in the price of Bitcoin will happen.\nDo you think that we’ll see a surge in Bitcoin price like we did in late 2017?

J.P Morgan Chase ‘Looking Into’ Bitcoin (BTC), Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies Posted by Cryptobble on May 17, 2018 4:10 pmCategories: News Top Stories In a complete 180 degree turn from previous comments by J.P Morgan Chase CEO and Chairman, Jamie Dimon, and with regards to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, the company’s co-president, Daniel Pinto, has stated that they are looking into the crypto space. In an interview with CNBC, Mr Pinto had this to say when asked about Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies: We are looking into that space. I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role. [Regarding bitcoin], you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities. That will have a very short life, because people will stop believing in it, or the regulators will kill it. I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form. He also remarked about the current trend of Wallstreet firms offering Futures products on Bitcoin and other prominent cryptocurrencies: If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No Mr. Pinto’s comments came almost 6 months after Jamie Dimon had slammed Bitcoin by calling it a fraud. Mr. Dimon had further declared that his firm was willing to fire any employee willing to trade Bitcoin for it was a stupid act. He would later backpedal on his comments to the delight of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who in turn predicted that it would only be a matter of time before he sees the benefits of the crypto and blockchain industry. J.P Morgan Chase has done just that when it filed for a blockchain patent back in October. The news was not unveiled until earlier this month. The patent outlines a system that would essentially use distributed ledger technology – blockchain – to keep track of payments sent between financial institutions. In a nutshell, ‘big’ Wallstreet firms have finally seen the light and are in the process of investing in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. [Photo source, money.cnn.com]\nThanks for reading!

Mai 2018  Die Frankfurter Northern Bitcoin AG setzt die Maßstäbe für nachhaltiges Bitcoin-Mining. Sie schürft (mint) neue Bitcoins klimaneutral sowie emissionsfrei und verwendet dafür die modernste Mining-Hardware. Damit zeigt sie, dass man die neue Kryptowährung Bitcoin nicht nur umweltverträglich, sondern auch gleichzeitig effizient und  im Hinblick auf die Zukunft  nachhaltig minen kann. Dazu kombiniert Northern Bitcoin die effizienteste Mining-Hardware mit den einzigartigen Standortvorteilen eines ehemaligen Bergwerks: In der Lefdal-Mine in Norwegen, ca. 180 Kilometer nördlich von Bergen, hat Northern Bitcoin seinen ersten Standort gefunden. Dort ist hundert Meter tief unter der Erde im Fels eines umgewidmeten Olivin-Bergwerks ein hochmodernes Rechenzentrum entstanden, das zu 100 Prozent klimaneutral betrieben wird. Der Strom dafür kommt aus erneuerbaren Energien, gekühlt werden die Miner mit dem kalten Wasser des benachbarten Fjords. Die Energie- und Betriebskosten sind gering, in den Hallen tief unter der Erde ist die Mining-Hardware von Northern Bitcoin außerdem sicher vor elektromagnetischen Störungen.Wir haben Norwegen als unseren Standort für das Mining gewählt, weil wir dort mit der kühlen Witterung, dem schnellen Internet, den günstigen Strompreisen und nicht zuletzt der politischen Stabilität ideale Rahmenbedingungen vorfinden, sagt Moritz Jäger, Chief Technology Officer der Frankfurter Gesellschaft, und erläutert: Wir sind sehr erfolgreich dabei, dort einen energetisch hocheffizienten und gleichzeitig nachhaltigen Bitcoin-Mining-Pool aufzubauen. Die Mining-Hardware ist jeweils als eigenständiges Rechenzentrum in standardisierten 40-Fuß-Containern installiert. Das erhöht die Flexibilität und garantiert unbegrenzte Skalierbarkeit. Es sind vor allem zwei Faktoren, die das Bitcoin-Mining bestimmen: Die Hardware und der Standort, sagt Jäger, und weiter: Es liegt auf der Hand, dass man in diesem Geschäft nur erfolgreich sein kann, wenn man beides in optimaler Weise kombiniert. Dabei spielt für uns die Nachhaltigkeit eine zentrale Rolle.\nDer Bitcoin wird digital gemined und transferiert. Er ist fälschungssicher und nicht manipulierbar. Dazu muss die Computer-Hardware der Bitcoin-Miner aufwendige Rechenoperationen mit enormen Strombedarf durchführen. Da der Bitcoin weltweit zu großen Teilen auch mit Strom aus fossilen Energieträgern gemined wird, belasten die Emissionen die Umwelt. Der berechtigten Kritik daran tritt Northern Bitcoin mit seinem nachhaltigen Konzept entgegen.Der Bitcoin beruht auf einer revolutionären Technologie. Er ist die Digitalisierung des alten, analogen Bezahlens, aber ohne zwischengeschaltete Banken, das erste dezentrale Peer-to-Peer-Bezahlsystem mit komplett digitalem Geld. Während Währungen länderspezifisch sind, ist der Bitcoin global. Er fördert Globalisierung und Welthandel. Jeder Mensch weltweit, der ein Smartphone besitzt oder Zugang zu einem Computer hat, kann den Bitcoin nutzen. Er macht rund dreiviertel des weltweiten Volumens an Kryptowährungen aus und ist die führende Kryptowährung.

The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nNot everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move.\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,” Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s “Blockchain Week.” “We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.”\nNow read: Bitcoin mining rig maker files for $1-billion IPO bitcoin Consensus Jack Dorsey Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:45:01.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e20d548c3dcd36e1557014b2cce6c867ad382a03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5xMeqvwKshRpQHt2EQ8VUo-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e20d548c3dcd36e1557014b2cce6c867ad382a03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5xMeqvwKshRpQHt2EQ8VUo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nEarn Bitcoins while using Mozilla Firefox!

The currency was trading at a measly $8,200 during yesterday’s afternoon hours, but has since spiked by roughly $100 to trade at its current price of $8,300. It’s nothing huge, but it’s a step in the right direction.\nBitcoin had previously started a journey that many of us originally thought would ease the currency closer towards recovery. A price bump had initially occurred after the start of the Coindesk Consensus Conference on Monday, and bitcoin was trading for as high as $8,500.\nWith the Conference now over, bitcoin incurred another $300 spike to $8,800 about 48 hours ago, though it has since slumped by $500, suggesting that the hoopla surrounding the Conference and the prospects of learning about bitcoin may have been short-lived. As a three-day event, it was probably silly on our part to assume that any sort of craze or bitcoin boost would last beyond that point.\nOne source discusses the Conference’s inability to push bitcoin any further. It states that the currency ultimately encountered hardcore resistance at $8,400, which it was unable to pass. It states that the coin has now entered a stalling period, and likely won’t incur growth in the immediate future.\n“After holding $9K support for several weeks, bitcoin finds itself under this widely watched support level,” explained Jani Ziedins of Cracked Markets. “As I warned readers two weeks ago, there comes a point where support turns into stalling. This is what happened here. I’m skeptical of BTC at these levels, and it needs to recover to $9K as soon as possible to prove me wrong. Otherwise, expect nervous selling to return and push us back under the $6K lows.”\nBitcoin last graced $6,000 back in March before incurring a $1,200 rise in 48 hours to bring it up to the low $8,000 range.\nWe’re also witnessing more bearish attitudes amongst analysts, like one who claims that Fundstrat’s method for understanding and predicting bitcoin’s price is completely outdated. Known as the “ Labor Theory of Value ,” it says that the price of a good or service is ultimately determined by the work required to produce it.\nFundstrat allegedly uses the expected path of break-even bitcoin mining costs to forecast the price, which will reportedly stand at $36,000 by the end of 2019. Many sources and competing analysts cite this method of decision-making as popular amongst Marxist economists, and believe it is ineffective when one is truly trying to determine the coin’s future. These analysts are much more reliant on what they call “ subjective valuation ,” which states that the value of a good or service is whatever someone pays for it, regardless of the effort that went into it.\nIn basic terminology, bitcoin will always be worth whatever the “other person” is willing to pay. If you’re able to find someone who will pay more for bitcoin, the price can rise. If traders begin purchasing bitcoin at lesser prices, the total value of the coin will fall, suggesting that the crypto market is probably more speculative than many of us would like to think.
