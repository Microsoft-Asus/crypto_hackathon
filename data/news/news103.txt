The recovery rate was more than 4 percent.\nWhile we can't be sure if this is the beginning of a dramatic recovery for the softcoin considering its high volatility, such a short-term bullish rally was rarely seen in recent weeks.\nBitcoin still has a long way to scale back to last Monday's high of $8,644.\nThe bullish trend is a welcome change to a crypto market that has been bleeding for over three weeks now.\nThe latest phase of Bitcoin's bullish-to-bearish trend change started early this month after the price almost touched the $10,000 mark on May 6.\nBitcoin suffered a decline of around 35 percent over the last 30 days.\nEthereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin too are on the rise.\nby Joji Xavier RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:54:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e153ceb0f43eb70e2d9c4ec0c6f28409b204fff0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ntJ0wakVKbLM8kvh.80T4VI7hQsI41H4y8YPL7yQu9QezNAtixwuhWgryxM9g_7ctX1ThdddM7A--", "site_full": "www.bn1magazine.co.uk", "site": "bn1magazine.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.bn1magazine.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Conference", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Conference", "published": "2018-05-29T17:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bn1magazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e153ceb0f43eb70e2d9c4ec0c6f28409b204fff0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ntJ0wakVKbLM8kvh.80T4VI7hQsI41H4y8YPL7yQu9QezNAtixwuhWgryxM9g_7ctX1ThdddM7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jack Kane-Hall", "published": "2018-05-29T17:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Conference", "text": "29 May 2018 0 Shares Cryptocurrency conference BitBrighton is coming to Brighton on Sat 23 Jun to discuss and enjoy all aspects of the revolutionary currency, Bitcoin. The conference will hold hourly workshops with the hopes of delving into the history of the cryptocurrency and also why it exists, where it comes from and how to use it. Those involved will be shown how looking after your cryptocurrency safely requires you to fully understand exactly what it is you are storing, explained in simple terms avoiding technical lingo as much as possible. Matthew Baldock from Portsmouth Crypto will be hosting the workshops and will hold a free discussion for all workshop attendees to discuss the use of the similar crypto currency, Altcoin. The discussion will involve learning about the various types of alt coins, where they come from, why they exist and what it is that they do. The conference, which will be held at The Latest Bar in Brighton from 12pm – 5:30pm, will also hold a presentation and Q&A with Fiona Cooper, who is also known as Brighton Crypto Woman. Tickets, which are free, also include entry to the Bitcoin cinema at the venue throughout the day. On show will be documentaries on the Bitcoin revolution and a presentation by Andreas Antonopolos, a well-known advocate for Bitcoin.\nFor more information and for tickets, visit BitBrighton here . 0 Shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitbrighton.org/conf2018/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fiona cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew baldock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brighton crypto woman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:02:48.064+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a4a513eb227b747447868186161068c4306a33b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3WQysYFI1SYap7ZI7MwvJztm5adYbrOfmUEkxPGROtl45t7ZthsiGshY1i7Hmb5HPDs2RqFP_LnUxPoRcI3N3VDSao2hDH_.AlIDoZqWI8vg4J1IQcHHh8Ghvs1dTLZaGgBxFof_JziddYWg6rx7Tcwfc6Tq6qtnHIWvwRaHV9VzvuBX8k5Gn6GJjnmeQB5PMNJ_jk06z_ehGWQLH2NvH", "site_full": "www.liputan6.com", "site": "liputan6.com", "site_section": "https://www.liputan6.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Berita", "title": "Masjid di London Buka Layanan Infak dan Sedekah dengan Bitcoin", "title_full": "Masjid di London Buka Layanan Infak dan Sedekah dengan Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T17:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 314, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a4a513eb227b747447868186161068c4306a33b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3WQysYFI1SYap7ZI7MwvJztm5adYbrOfmUEkxPGROtl45t7ZthsiGshY1i7Hmb5HPDs2RqFP_LnUxPoRcI3N3VDSao2hDH_.AlIDoZqWI8vg4J1IQcHHh8Ghvs1dTLZaGgBxFof_JziddYWg6rx7Tcwfc6Tq6qtnHIWvwRaHV9VzvuBX8k5Gn6GJjnmeQB5PMNJ_jk06z_ehGWQLH2NvH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T17:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Masjid di London Buka Layanan Infak dan Sedekah dengan Bitcoin", "text": "Ilustrasi Bitcoin (iStockPhoto)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "masjid di london buka layanan infak", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:28:28.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8632fa72c1ca70ac2acf984c6f8c4c6e2eda91ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXIbq4kvUPSvBDhxtiLfK5Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin can be useful for a troubled economy", "title_full": "Bitcoin can be useful for a troubled economy", "published": "2018-05-29T17:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.137, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8632fa72c1ca70ac2acf984c6f8c4c6e2eda91ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXIbq4kvUPSvBDhxtiLfK5Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "d0flaming0", "published": "2018-05-29T17:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can be useful for a troubled economy", "text": "Yes Bitcoin and other Cryptos can be beneficial to struggling countries.

CoinDesk The Bitcoin price has spiked after both of the first two halvening events\nWhile the Bitcoin price has climbed somewhat ahead of both subsequent halving events, the price has gone on to boom in the subsequent 12 or so months.\nMany Bitcoin and financial experts think this is similar to the way traditional markets price in changes to interest rates or changes to commodity supply.\n\"Previous halvenings have shown negligible impact on Bitcoin's price. This is because — rather like a much anticipated interest rate cut — everybody already knows it's going to happen way in advance,\" said Glen Goodman, Bitcoin analyst and author of forthcoming book The Crypto Trader.\nIf the market knows the supply is due to be reduced at a certain time, and by what it will be reduced by, it will begin applying that reduction to the price gradually — avoiding sharp spikes and dips.\n\"Historically the cut has had very little immediate impact, although the price usually rose after,\" said Chris Wilmer, professor at the University of Pittsburgh and co-author of Bitcoin for the Befuddled.\nThe rise in price makes sense in so far as large buyers of Bitcoins have to either buy on the market or get them through mining, and after a halving event it forces more people to buy on the market.\n\"Cryptocurrency markets are often very event driven, and as we get closer to the next halving bitcoin’s price will receive a boost from those anticipating the forthcoming reduction in new supply,\" said Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain and co-founder of Mosaic. \"In the months leading-up to the last two halving events we saw bitcoin's price steadily trend upward, and then power higher following the reward halving.\"\nThere are more factors in play, however...\nThorsten Koeppl, professor of economics at Queen's University in Canada, said: \"It appears to us, any cryptocurrency should economically do the opposite of what Bitcoin is doing.\n\"The value of Bitcoin is partly driven by its potential as a payments tool and, before the fees rose along with the price, there were people using Bitcoin for international transfers. This has become more expensive to do now. But the price is still being supported.\"\nThe increase in fees over the last couple of years — along with the rise in Bitcoin price — is a direct result of more people using the Bitcoin network.\nIn December there were roughly 400,000 transactions per day though this has now fallen back to around 200,000 transactions per day , and fees are back down with it.\nAs the Bitcoin reward for mining new blocks on the blockchain falls, miners will increasingly rely on fees, which they get as an incentive to confirm Bitcoin transactions.\nMiners use the miner fees attached to transactions to decide which ones to confirm — choosing the biggest ones first. Eventually, once all the 21 million possible Bitcoins are mined, miners will rely entirely on these fees for their income.\nThe Bitcoin halvening and miners\nThose first affected by a Bitcoin halvening are the miners, with new Bitcoin coming at the expense of computer processing time and electricity.\nIn recent years the cost of mining has risen significantly, although both big Bitcoin mining consortiums and smaller miners are still able to make money despite some claiming Bitcoin mining globally is now using more electricity than the whole of Ireland .\nBut for miners, a halvening means a big drop in revenue.\nAhead of the second halvening in 2016 the price of Bitcoin at the time meant one block mined resulted in new Bitcoin worth around $16,000. That would have fallen to $8,000 directly after the halvening.\nHowever, it's possible for the network to balance itself. As mining difficulty increases, fewer miners will be able to continue.\n\"If the potential rewards from mining are lower because of the halvening, that may discourage many people from mining Bitcoin\", according to Goodman.\nBut the beauty of the Bitcoin protocol means that if hashing power leaves the network then the difficulty of mining a new block will automatically be reduced. So less hashing power and less electricity will be required to mine each new Bitcoin.\nHileman added: \"I do not anticipate a significant change in the total mining hash rate due to the halving, at least not in the short run. Miners have historically shown a willingness to maintain or increase computing power through halving events because they expect future bitcoin price increases to offset the reduced block reward.\"\nAccording to Charles Hayter, chief executive of cryptocurrency data analysis firm Crypto Compare, t here will be a \"wipe out of old miners profitability\", though Hayter suggested improvements in chip technology will bring better power ratings, efficiencies and price.\nMeanwhile, if the price of Bitcoin rises enough — or is pushed higher by the miners who now need to be better compensated by fewer coins per block — there will be as many miners as before.

At launch, the operator will support trading of a limited number of cryptocurrency pairs and offer zero trading fees for the first three months. BTCC Exchange to Launch New And Enhanced Platform In June\nThe oldest Bitcoin exchange in the world is reforming its modus operandi by enlarging its cryptocurrency trading offering as well as by optimizing to include offline cold storage and SSL encrypted traffic to protect its customer’s digital assets.\nBTCC Exchange has more than seven years of experience in bringing together buyers and sellers of Bitcoin (BTC). It is new enlarging the scope of its offering to Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and their respective trading pairs. For the first three months starting in June, users will face no trading fees.\nThe launch of the new BTCC Exchange platform will introduce its users to enhanced liquidity, faster deposits and withdrawals, and small bid-offer spreads, according to the company. Technically, the exchange says it has invested in a cutting-edge system proper for trading at the highest standards. The operator is now using a multi-tier, multi-clustered system with an optimized, high-speed memory trading engine.\nAs cryptocurrency exchange hacks present one of the most difficult challenges for both sides, operators and customers, the oldest Bitcoin platform in the world reminded users that it has never been hacked in more than seven years online, but it is still optimizing security through cold storage and encryption systems.\n“BTCC’s exchange is backed by seven years of operational experience and has been optimized to include offline cold storage and SSL encrypted traffic to protect your digital assets. We take security very seriously and are proud of the fact that we have never been compromised.”\nRecent virtual currency exchange thefts include the CoinSecure hack in April 2018. Worth 438 Bitcoin (approximately $3.3 million), the company accused one employee for the inside jobs. In February, the BitGrail hack amounted to $195 million worth of NANO. The exchange failed to secure its coin storage. The most valuable hack in 2018 so far was on Coincheck exchange , who seems to have neglected security measures on NEM. The hack was worth over $500 million.\nThe operator is also promoting user referrals, verifications, and deposits, with its reward point system that provides benefits across the BTCC ecosystem, including both BTCC Pool and Mobi wallet.\nBTCC Exchange offers Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange services, a digital currency wallet, physical bitcoins, and mining pools.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/10/nano-foundation-offers-support-in-lawsuit-over-bitgrail-xrb-hack/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/03/28/another-class-action-suit-coincheck-hack-aftermath/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/17/coinsecure-confirms-victims-recent-hack-will-refunded/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oldest bitcoin exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btcc exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:46:56.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "444e5012c6f29b5e38cb758812029085f7184126", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNGSv7fpOGnrYvnJkSORdM0GIijYVqYCjqX8CAwJ3IWV_zE0iTm1FtYtHpJ6fk6uc", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "BestMixer.io Unveils Bitcoin Mixer Service", "title_full": "BestMixer.io Unveils Bitcoin Mixer Service", "published": "2018-05-29T17:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bestmixer.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "444e5012c6f29b5e38cb758812029085f7184126", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNGSv7fpOGnrYvnJkSORdM0GIijYVqYCjqX8CAwJ3IWV_zE0iTm1FtYtHpJ6fk6uc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-29T17:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "BestMixer.io Unveils Bitcoin Mixer Service", "text": "BestMixer.io Unveils Bitcoin Mixer Service May 29, 2018 323 Privacy oriented crypto users can take safe haven in new anonymization tool\nSignaling a new era in privacy for cryptocurrency users, Bestmixer.io has revealed a game changing bitcoin mixer service that has forced the industry to take notice. Unlike previous bitcoin anonymization tools, Bestmixer.io features complete, verifiable anonymization for bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cash, ethereum, and litecoin.\nIn the world of cryptocurrency privacy is an issue that should be central to all users. The evidence for this is clear when leading figures in the industry such as Ian Balina have their accounts targeted and compromised leading to multi-million dollar digital heists. Bestmixer.io’s bitcoin mixer ensures its users the maximum in digital currency protection by making it impossible for bad actors to follow digital tracks using the signatures left behind by the movement of cryptocurrencies between wallets. Just take a look at their funny short video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYDTKpTkCs\n“Each user in a Blockchain network has at least one alias, which is a receiving address. As long as the receiving address is associated with an individual, its owner’s financial activity can be traced in the public registry of transactions,” said the BestMixer.io team in a recent update. “Most financial services adhere to policies such as KYC and AML, which require clients to provide identification documents in order to use the services of these financial service companies. Even if you use cryptocurrency only for purchasing physical goods, you will still need to provide certain personal information like your delivery address, name, and contact information.”\nBestMixer.io recognizes the importance of breaking the link between old and new addresses by using a method akin to a bitcoin laundry. The service works by having users deposit their bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, or litecoin into the BestMixer.io reserve pool. The pool contains the coins of other users and blends them together, resulting in a mix of coins that are essentially cleaned of their previous origins. These untraceable coins fend off forms of surveillance such as blockchain analysis which is used to search rich lists and target small and large wallets alike.\n“BestMixer.io mixes client’s coins using anonymous funds. To defend your transactions from blockchain analysis, solving them like a huge Sudoku, bitcoin mixer BestMixer.io sends a combination of random split of up to 0.1% of the intended fund to multiple clients’ wallets. Also, to reinforce protection of customers’ privacy, we use deferred transactions with accuracy in minutes, and custom service fees,” noted the BestMixer.io team in a recent bitcoin mixer Reddit discussion.\nSome users will have very large sums of cryptocurrency that need the utmost in anonymous protection, and to address these needs the Bestmixer.io team have created three pools (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) to provide increasingly intricate bitcoin blender services. This is especially useful in light of the recent rise of Chainalysis, a bitcoin forensics startup working with the IRS to link individuals to bitcoin wallets. The use of BestMixer.io’s Gamma pool ensures that user funds will be undetectable by forensics startups like Chainalysis by drawing funds from private, reliable sources of coins.

Trademark infringement is not enforceable?\nHowever, it is still unclear whether the accusatory company will actually proceed with his threats, or whether the trademark infringement is work actually. According to another Reddit user who commented on the post, the claim is “unenforceable” because the term “Bitcoin” is much too General.\n“Basically, it is not executable, mt.gox had it protected years ago (“security”) in the UK, but even that was understandable, since the Name” Bitcoin “is much to General to be trademarked (I checked this years ago, personally)”\nThe sue company also holds the trademark rights to the “WESTWORLD”, which is probably thanks to the eponymous TV Show on HBO.

The market value of Bitcoins has had wild swings in value and even a market cap.\n-Bitcoin is a social network. The Bitcoin \"community\" is active and acts like other online social networks.\n-There are only 21 million bits so it has the same value as gold.\nBitcoin have value because we are all expecting for the price increase that will give everyone a big profit.

Mr. Woo, via twitter, indicated that his analysis did not see BTC holding at $7,000 and would plunge further to $5,500 – $5,700 levels before any signs of recovery.\nHe had this to say via twitter:\nI think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can’t see $7000 holding. Most likely we’ll balance a bit, then we’ll slide through. Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess\nHe outlined 4 reasons in the follow up to the tweet, for the lack of stability in Bitcoin\nThe NVT signal is still too high for BTC. The market needs more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. The said transactional activity is highly unlikely in a bear market. Therefore, there will be further decline in BTC The volatility is still too high The standard NVT is high and more time will be needed to bring it down A Volume profile cliff below $6,800 What exactly is an NVT signal/ratio? Standard NVT Ratio is simply the Network Valuation divided by the Transaction Value flowing through the blockchain and then smoothed using a moving average. NVT Signal then applies the moving average to only the transaction value. The signal is the work of Willy Woo and Dimitry Kalichki.\nFurther insights by Willy Woo about the current trend. Willy Woo would further state that he does not see BTC falling further down the $5,000s levels. He was also quick to point out that given the historical background of the crypto markets, there is more data to work with than in 2014. He stressed that the price of BTC follows an adoption curve where we see a climb, then consolidation, then another climb and consolidation.\nMr. Woo had this to say to summarize his observations:\nSo, in summary, my best guess… slowish bleed down to $6800… then a steeper slide to $5700, then a leveling out of the drop… then a flat zone. This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement.\nIn conclusion, the situation in the crypto markets will get worse before it gets better with the next rally possibly in the third quarter of 2018.\nDisclaimer: This article is not meant to give financial advice.

All that shows a possible strength and is optimistic for the future.\nThis article is written by Tomasz Wisniewski, a senior analyst at Alpari Research & Analysis\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: USDCAD Manages to Breach 1.30 Price Handle Ahead of BOC Rate Statement Wheat Prices Surge Testing Resistance; Corn and Soybeans Follow DAX Index Falls on Italian Fears Blockchain Technology Is About to Open the pre-IPO Market to Retail Investors EUR/USD, AUD/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY Daily Outlook – May 29, 2018 Technical Update For EUR/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD & AUD/USD: 29.05.2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/markets/gbp-jpy/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usdcad-manages-breach-1-30-price-handle-ahead-boc-rate-statement-505462", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbpjpy-jumps-cliff-bitcoin-lower-line-triangle-505468", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbpjpy-jumps-cliff-bitcoin-lower-line-triangle-505468&quot;", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VmXim_17TU?feature=oembed", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/gbp-jpy/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/505417-505417", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/technical-update-eur-usd-usd-jpy-usd-cad-aud-usd-29-05-2018-505495", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-chf/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/wheat-prices-surge-testing-resistance-corn-soybeans-follow-505483", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-aud-usd-gbp-usd-usd-jpy-daily-outlook-may-29-2018-505449", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/btc-usd/overview", "http://alpari.news/en/our-team/", "http://alpari.news/en/our-team/&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/btc-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/blockchain-technology-open-pre-ipo-market-retail-investors-505514", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-chf/overview"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tomasz wisniewski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alpari research & analysis this", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:59:53.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40d2c6f36331ba5caebbf6ce5343b40fe7ac5541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8rBmJcD77ELu6zrVjcbptQKwqaXVb93muaTsR8JHc4A0vubhkn2.SP2odV9wkvkm336nqWTrrOhdAPrQhO54ODds2lH7nj9RbgmDj18qCpkUCC7xwb7.fykagwkCz6u8do6cv9yZow--", "site_full": "blog.successwithagile.com", "site": "successwithagile.com", "site_section": "http://blog.successwithagile.com/index.php/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Agile Blog", "title": "Lots of Blockchain Jobs – Rise and Fall with Bitcoin Price?", "title_full": "Lots of Blockchain Jobs – Rise and Fall with Bitcoin Price?", "published": "2018-05-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40d2c6f36331ba5caebbf6ce5343b40fe7ac5541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8rBmJcD77ELu6zrVjcbptQKwqaXVb93muaTsR8JHc4A0vubhkn2.SP2odV9wkvkm336nqWTrrOhdAPrQhO54ODds2lH7nj9RbgmDj18qCpkUCC7xwb7.fykagwkCz6u8do6cv9yZow--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "edtheadmin", "published": "2018-05-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lots of Blockchain Jobs – Rise and Fall with Bitcoin Price?", "text": "FROM: https://decentralized.tv/bitcoinzap-like-bitcoinyomama-but-worse/ BitcoinZAP… it’s a thing apparently… will you… invest?

The local company General Bytes, that is also one of the largest Bitcoin ATM manufacturers in the world, has been in charge of the installation of the ATMs.\nPrague’s Bitcoin Metro System Prague has one of the most important metro systems in Europe and the 5th busiest in the continent, transporting over 1.6 million passengers a day. With the new ATMs several individuals will be able to have access to the crypto market. People traveling in the metro that want to gain some exposure to cryptocurrencies will now be able to buy these digital assets.\nThe information has been revealed by the Czech firm, General Bytes which is one of the most important cryptocurrency-related companies in the country. The machines will be located in 10 of the most important metro stations in the city: Mustek, Nádrazí Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černy Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádrazi.\nSome of these metro stations are located in very touristic places, something that could be very promising for the crypto community in the city. At the moment, there are several places and shops that accept virtual currencies, including a Coffee Shop that accepts only BTC; and the Crypto Anarchy Institute known as Paralelní Polis.\nIt is important to mark that General Bytes has an important share of the worldwide Bitcoin ATM market. At the moment, it has installed 861 crypto ATM’s in different countries, and in the future this number is expected to keep increasing.\nThe Czech Republic is one of the countries with the highest number of crypto ATMs installed in the world. At the moment there are 46 locations with Bitcoin ATMs and is the 7th country after the United States (1965 locations), Canada (532 locations), Austria (177 locations), United Kingdom (134 locations), Spain (55 locations) and Russia (49 locations).\nThe Czech Republic Moves Towards Cryptocurrencies The installment of 10 new ATMs in the Metro is just one of the latest events related to virtual currencies in the European country. Some days ago, an important Czech utility company, known as Pražská Plynárenská started to accept cryptocurrency payments for its services. The company is one of the major suppliers of natural gas in the country, and is engaged in other commercial activities.\nPavel Janeček, Chief Executive Officer of Pražská Plynárenská, said about it:\n“In June we are opening a payment gateway, which will automatically transfer our bitcoin payments into regular currency, so that we don’t have to speculate with cryptocurrency. But if anyone wants to pay in an alternative way, we want to allow them to do that.”\nAt the same time, the important retailer in Czechia, Alza.cz, accepts Bitcoin payments and since the beginning of this year, it decided to accept Litecoin (LTC) payments.\nThere are many other smaller places in Prague that are working with virtual currencies and involved in the market. Moreover, the community is very active and there are crypto-related meetings in the city very often.\nThe post Prague Metro System Has Now Installed Bitcoin ATMs Everywhere appeared first on Ethereum World News.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nádrazí veleslavín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hlavní nádrazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skalka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prague metro system has now installed bitcoin atms everywhere prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin metro system prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general bytes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejvická", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zličín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankrác", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T05:12:59.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e08761cb912ff43e5ba33224096c9242e6674a68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtEg61x5cGZBdK6i4wI6gU5GJ057HybiUXNAKvebr2z_cxE8yIrpgmOg--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Nowadays Investing In Bitcoin Be Like....", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Nowadays Investing In Bitcoin Be Like....", "published": "2018-05-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e08761cb912ff43e5ba33224096c9242e6674a68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtEg61x5cGZBdK6i4wI6gU5GJ057HybiUXNAKvebr2z_cxE8yIrpgmOg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Nowadays Investing In Bitcoin Be Like....", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:13:57.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fcfc9d42fd9881d1b0f6190f2d50bdcaf60b2cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPXBupyTb3Y6rMe2UNu7nuIg7RQCeL7xHfWvPvuAjn6InNLQUaapaDv0vGPIisTYTOBv1PNWXr2YopQDYaTffG4", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "BTCC Exchange, the world’s oldest Bitcoin exchang", "title_full": "BTCC Exchange, the world’s oldest Bitcoin exchang", "published": "2018-05-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6fcfc9d42fd9881d1b0f6190f2d50bdcaf60b2cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPXBupyTb3Y6rMe2UNu7nuIg7RQCeL7xHfWvPvuAjn6InNLQUaapaDv0vGPIisTYTOBv1PNWXr2YopQDYaTffG4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ricardo Esteves", "published": "2018-05-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTCC Exchange, the world’s oldest Bitcoin exchang", "text": "BTCC Exchange, the world’s oldest Bitcoin exchange has announced an upgraded platform next June.

November 30th 2017 /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Technology - syndicated/ The Bitcoin craze is creating a new breed of problem gambler. Source:AFP A HOSPITAL in the UK has begun offering treatment for bitcoin addicts as the cryptocurrency craze fuels a new breed of gambling addicts.\nCastle Craig Hospital in Scotland has launched a program aimed specifically at people who are hooked on trading digital currencies like bitcoin.\nThe hospital specialises in treating addictions and had been asked to help people with cryptocurrency problems. It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were “a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction”.\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n“It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it’s mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.”\nAnd that’s where the havoc begins.\n“People dive in because they don’t want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.”\nIn that regard, it wasn’t surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n“I think it’s an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That’s what a compulsive gambler wants.” A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically Source:AFP\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n“It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It’s a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.”\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n“It’s relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don’t know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it’s relatively easy.”\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n“A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don’t want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.”\nThe situation “just goes bad” from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n“They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don’t realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.”\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late.\n“Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.”\nThe moment of realisation was depressingly familiar.\n“It’s usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.”\nCastle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery. trending in technology", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://castlecraig.co.uk/resources/gambling/cryptocurrency-addiction/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "castle craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp a hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nottingham trent university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:08:28.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebeb953e8b63ea83efb576edb2e9276608a23923", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eHxrFQW2u5u.3U8W2wWUheEQyYmKqzT3ynHErnr2A6epH3AWsdenX_Els5ySu4DZjlOI9ITN5qXuI4mle.R0vBQYZ0qUtjw3v", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "'Bitcoin (BTC) To Test $5,500 - $5,700 Before Any Signs of Recovery,' says Analyst - Ethereum World News", "title_full": "'Bitcoin (BTC) To Test $5,500 - $5,700 Before Any Signs of Recovery,' says Analyst - Ethereum World News : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-05-29T16:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.403, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebeb953e8b63ea83efb576edb2e9276608a23923", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eHxrFQW2u5u.3U8W2wWUheEQyYmKqzT3ynHErnr2A6epH3AWsdenX_Els5ySu4DZjlOI9ITN5qXuI4mle.R0vBQYZ0qUtjw3v", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JohnPNjui", "published": "2018-05-29T16:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Bitcoin (BTC) To Test $5,500 - $5,700 Before Any Signs of Recovery,' says Analyst - Ethereum World News", "text": "submitted by /u/JohnPNjui\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-btc-to-test-5500-5700-before-any-signs-of-recovery-says-analyst/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T13:02:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75ac2f1b00bca597b38cb2ff1f5f2335e08f0d92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J2eLSvO9um7niQDgFcodiappTeKLeeUhZiKNC_TB_iDQlnXUgAk6FZSUoV6odCaUo-", "site_full": "earnforum.net", "site": "earnforum.net", "site_section": "http://earnforum.net/viewforum.php?f=17", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "EarnForum.net - Online Money Making Forum - Earn Online - Earning offers • View forum - Online exchanges", "title": "Convert Bitcoins on pay pal", "title_full": "EarnForum.net - Online Money Making Forum - Earn Online - Earning offers • View topic - Convert Bitcoins on pay pal", "published": "2018-05-29T16:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.096, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75ac2f1b00bca597b38cb2ff1f5f2335e08f0d92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J2eLSvO9um7niQDgFcodiappTeKLeeUhZiKNC_TB_iDQlnXUgAk6FZSUoV6odCaUo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "abdelkaderfarm", "published": "2018-05-29T16:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Convert Bitcoins on pay pal", "text": "Had you bros had experience with www.x-crypto.com giving Bitcoins with having cash with peypal account?

We cover these opinions in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Of course, positive predictions are almost always balanced by some negative expectations; in this case they are part of a short-term prognosis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints McAfee Sees Bitcoin Beyond $15,000 in June\nSoon after tweeting that “institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” cybersecurity guru John McAfee issued another bullish prediction. Focusing on short term analysis this time, which he admits is not his favorite, he turns attention to several events that may influence the cryptocurrency market – which, in his words, “will turn before June 12.”\nAccording to McAfee , the “Korea deal is done and Trump will sign the documents in Singapore on 12 June […] The various noises being made are propaganda for domestic consumption,” he notes. After Singapore, the software businessman expects a visit by the US President to Japan, where “talks on creating a gold backed US currency will commence.”\nBitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicts. His post also features several altcoins like golem, docademic, bezop, bitcoin private, and EOS. McAfee, who is a known supporter of cryptocurrencies and their adoption, has previously stated that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million per coin by the end of 2020.\nIn recently recorded video , the internet security expert also talks about “the war we are all engaged in.” The banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto, in his judgement. In a rather calm tone, McAfee advises crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. John McAfee calls on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” Bitcoin Still a Buy, Good for Store of Value\nMcAfee is not alone in the optimists’ camp. According to blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart, bitcoin is still worth buying, despite its continued losses. The increased number of use cases is a proof that BTC is becoming more institutionalized, he told CNBC . “Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,” Bogart said, noting that banks are either going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform, or are opening up a trading desk. Spencer Bogart advised investors to sell coins like cardano, tron, IOTA and NEO, but said they should hold cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum, ripple, and EOS.\nAccording to Matt Hougan, Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, the most compelling use case for bitcoin today is as a store of value, although he admits the idea is often dismissed because of the volatility of the cryptocurrency. “Gold is solid. Bitcoin is volatile. It’ll never work – these statements are ignorant of gold’s history and devoid of imagination,” Hougan recently wrote in an op-ed piece for Forbes .\n“Before 1971, the US dollar was hard-backed by gold, and gold’s value was effectively vouchsafed by the full faith and credit of our government. When Richard Nixon took the US off of the gold standard, it set gold loose from its moorings,” Matt Hougan explains. “What followed was a period of huge volatility, as gold fought to establish itself as an independent store of wealth. In 1974, for instance, gold bullion prices rose 73%, before falling 24% in 1975. In 1981, gold lost 33% of its value, after being up 121% just two years prior,” he details. Russian Experts Expect Further Decline in Prices\nCrypto experts contacted by Russian media are not so optimistic, at least in the short run. The value of bitcoin core (BTC) will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold, they claim. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $7,450, while bitcoin cash (BCH) holds over $900.\nThe downward trend is largely due to decisions and statements made by regulators in a number of countries, points out Vladislav Antonov, analyst at Alpari. Several factors have caused the weakening of bitcoin, according to the expert. Recently, the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into supposed price manipulations in the cryptocurrency markets. News came out that authorities in India may impose 18 percent tax on crypto trading.\nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , Antonov also mentioned the crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects and suspicious crypto activities, part of the coordinated “ Operation Crypto-Sweep ” in North America. Another event that has influenced the prices is the expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25th.\nIgor Zartdinov, co-founder of the ICG crypto fund, says the decrease in the value of bitcoin occurs on a neutral-to-positive news background. He thinks that market manipulation is a possible explanation, as big players usually earn at the expense of small investors. “That’s what we are seeing now,” Zartdinov believes.\nWhat are your predictions about the future of crypto markets?

But on the other hand, it is reaping the dark side of the digital currency.\nI think Bitcoin is very useful for criminals who want to hide money from their crimes. Because if they save money in the bank, the money from the crime can be easily traced. Bitcoin can also be abused by people who want to hide their income from government, and avoid paying taxes. Then, the state revenue from the tax will be lost because of the money that is not tracked. Not only in the criminal acts alone, the most basic lack of Bitcoin also occurs because of its unreal form.\nNot to mention the instability of the value of Bitcoin currency if converted to other conventional currencies are very volatile. Today, maybe the owner can be very rich by having Bitcoin worth 1,000 US dollars. However, who knows if in the future the value of money is only left 50 US dollars.\nsome minor events that cause huge losses for Bitcoin owners. A man once lost about 600 US dollars for doing a reset on his smart phone and in fact, he accidentally permanently remove the Bitcoin digital wallet.\nA number of online platforms are testing the payment with Bitcoin currency, among others WordPress, Reddit, Namecheap, Mega, and Zynga. However, some countries even banned transactions with Bitcoin. The Chinese government, for example, forbids all financial institutions from receiving Bitcoin transactions. While the EU rate Bitcoin more easily stolen. In terms of investment is also bad because the currency is determined only based on market demand and has a high fluctuation rate.\nDespite all of the advantages and the goods of bitcoin, it also has the its bad sides. One of these is its ability to change its price depends on the time. The volatility of bitcoin is dangerous because once that we ought to invest money that we have or maybe we gave our 99% on it, wemight gain profit, at the same time we might loss as well. That is why bitcoin became that risky because of its feature. Another one is that bitcoin today might be late and there must be or there should be a better digital currency that it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:39:54.073+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba3b4f0991c1873e8fe01b7d9c539e8af5f5d757", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbJhdy6SToplEs8Bes2Hm9vRLMrSdaEa.pVdbPkc_pNOTpLxXQ1I1e4NyVZQBxh4gI9tC_EUKQwScbWw2rrdmE", "site_full": "evilspeculator.com", "site": "evilspeculator.com", "site_section": "http://evilspeculator.com/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Evil Speculator", "title": "Bitcoin And The Trough Of Disillusionment", "title_full": "Bitcoin And The Trough Of Disillusionment", "published": "2018-05-29T16:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://evilspeculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Crypto_Hype_Cycle.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba3b4f0991c1873e8fe01b7d9c539e8af5f5d757", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbJhdy6SToplEs8Bes2Hm9vRLMrSdaEa.pVdbPkc_pNOTpLxXQ1I1e4NyVZQBxh4gI9tC_EUKQwScbWw2rrdmE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Mole", "published": "2018-05-29T16:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin And The Trough Of Disillusionment", "text": "Bitcoin And The Trough Of Disillusionment Key Concepts In Risk Management Top Ten Crypto Exchanges For Traders Popular Now VIX Sell Signal Versus Equities Living Inside a Broken Clock by The Mole May 29, 2018\nI hope you all had an eventful Memorial weekend, yet still managed to spare a few minutes of appreciation for our proud fighting men and women, here at home as well as abroad, in times past as well as at the present. Wherever you went, I hope it wasn’t Chicago .\nI for one spent my time away from the blog productively by putting the finishing touches on a new intra-day trading system I have been developing over the course of the past year in collaboration with another quant. It takes advantage of recurring IV inefficiencies in pertinent ETPs, and after hundreds of hours honing the system we are very excited about finally being able to deploy it live.\nReleasing a new system is always accompanied by a mix of emotions as it, per Murphy’s Law, will invariably head straight into a losing streak. Once the training wheels are off it is however exciting to see if reality is inclined to live up to theory. What’s most rewarding to me are all the things I learned in the process and the new skills I picked up, all of which of course will feed into future system development.\nSystem traders truly are like sharks but not in the fashion the gullible public would like to believe – rather in that stagnation without fail eventually leads to death. Trading the financial markets has always been and will continue to be an arms race, but it is one I deeply enjoy as it is one of the few remaining niches of life where good intentions without skill or talent mean nothing, while hubris, arrogance, and herd behavior are usually punished instantly and most severely. I personally wouldn’t want to have it any other way. Crypto In Decline\nNow while markets are starting to catch up after a low participation pre-holiday week of annoying whipsaw I thought I’d get us started with some musings regarding the drastic change in sentiment we have witnessed across all things crypto over the past six months. Whereas you could easily find yourself being tarred and feathered and then carried out of town on a rail by merely suggesting the possibility of a corrective phase in crypto currencies as late as mid December 2017, it’s hard to find anyone who’s bullish crypto these days.\nSo, what happened? Well, if you believe in the Gartner hype cycle, Bitcoin and the entire crypto space by extension entered its peak of inflated expectation in early 2018 and has since descended toward the trough of disillusionment. Now wait a minute, what exactly is a Gartner hype cycle and where can I buy one? Wikipedia defines it as:\nThe hype cycle is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner , for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific technologies.\nOf course none of this is completely new. Having followed technology for over 30 years now this reminds me a lot of the technology adoption curve described by Jeffrey A More in his 1991 book ‘Crossing the Chasm’, which was all the range back then. Where the Gartner curve differs however is in not focusing on discrete segments of population, (e.g. early adopters, majority, and laggards) but in outlining the progressing of perception and the hype that accompanies a particular concept or technology.\nTo be clear, the Gartner curve does not reflect an inherent quality of a particular technology, idea, or type of business, rather its premise lies in quantifying our collective perception of technological progress as well as that of its future value. Now wait a minute – future value? Doesn’t that sound a lot like the basic concept all futures markets are based on? Well, if you believe the hype then yes! (pun intended)\nThe graph above shows Gartner’s 2017 hype cycle for emerging technologies and at that time (July 2017) blockchain had already progressed far beyond its own peak with Bitcoin most likely already leading it lower. The underlying reasons for that are plentiful and most likely better explained by analysts more keyed into the crypto sphere as a whole. What’s The Big Deal?\nWhat I see personally is a phenomenon that I see regularly in the financial markets, which is a trending phase based on hype, a big shake out that punishes the late comers and greedy pigs, followed by an extended mind numbing corrective phase. All of which eventually leads into less volatile and more mature long term growth until the onset of the next hype phase.\nWhich of course brings me to Bitcoin, the actual financial currency many of us have been using, accumulating, and trading over the past few years. One would have to be blind not to see a pretty convincing correlation there. I did not find a bitcoin specific hype cycle issued by Gartner but given that the hype around Bitcoin was leading the somewhat delayed blockchain hype by at least six months if not a year, it’s rather interesting to realize that Bitcoin must have been pushing past its own peak in the Gartner cycle way ahead of the its market peak in early December of 2017.\nI’m not surprised there would be a significant delay between max hype and valuation, because that seems to be the nature of things. And once you start to recognize the underlying characteristic of a hype – pure greed mixed with unbridled optimism, it actually becomes quite easy to pin a bubble when you see one.\nFor there is nothing truly new under the sun. To make that point here are some seminal thoughts posted in Fortune magazine in 1996 (several years before the big 2000 dotcom crash) in reference of the 1929 crash, and by none other than John Rothchild, one of the direct descendants of Nathan Mayer, Freiherr von Rothschild the person who probably stands as our archetype of evil speculation:\nJOE KENNEDY, a famous rich guy in his day, exited the stock market in timely fashion after a shoeshine boy gave him some stock tips. He figured that when the shoeshine boys have tips, the market is too popular for its own good, a theory also advanced by Bernard Baruch, another vested interest who described the scene before the big Crash:\n“Taxi drivers told you what to buy. The shoeshine boy could give you a summary of the day’s financial news as he worked with rag and polish. An old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market. My cook had a brokerage account and followed the ticker closely. Her paper profits were quickly blown away in the gale of 1929.”\nAre we at the same fatal stage in the market today, when people who aren’t expected to have stock tips have stock tips, including hot dog vendors, shoeshine boys, the homeless, pedicurists, barroom dancers, toll takers, and the trumpet player at the racetrack? Will stock prices fall off the cliff under the weight of enormous popularity?\nAnd as we all know today, yes – they would and then some. Out Of The Ashes\nNow what follows the bust is usually a sobering period of normalization and I mean that in a very literal sense. After the hype and the ensuing loss (monetary as well as public attention) what usually remains is the true potential of a technology or idea. Which then either is abandoned, displaced, and forgotten – or it serves as the fertile ground that feeds into the rebirth of the Phoenix, but this time with slightly trimmed feathers, and a height ceiling 😉\nWhether Bitcoin and crypto in general will be heading into a more sustained long term future of course remains to be seen. I personally hope it does as I, despite my nefarious personal disposition and obvious character flaws, see a true benefit in the direct unfettered global exchange of financial value and information. And somehow I have an inkling that I may not stand alone.

The trademark holder has allegedly served an Etsy seller with a cease and desist order for using the BTC logo on his themed T-shirts. Bitcoin– It’s Official\nA.B.C. IPHoldings South West, LLC, a UK-based company and subsidiary of Monopolip LTD, has managed to secure a successful trademark registration for the term “Bitcoin” in three different asset classes as it follows: Class 25 – Clothing, footwear, and headgear. Class 32 – Fruit beverages, fruit juices, syrups, beers, mineral and aerated waters and other non-alcoholic beverages. Class 33 – Alcoholic beverages (excluding beers).\nThe owner of Monopolip LTD is Kjell Halvor Landsverk, a Norwegian entrepreneur. Despite the fact that there’s not a lot of information surrounding the company or its owner, registering the “Bitcoin” trademark does seem to fall in line with its nature of business dealings.\nPublic information on UK’s Company House official website shows that one of the two main fields of expertise of Monopolip LTD is “Leasing of intellectual property and similar products, except copyright works.” What is more, the company does seem to have applied for another potentially interesting trademark for the term “Westworld,” which is currently a popular HBO series. Swinging the Gavel of Litigation\nDespite the fact that the “Bitcoin” trademark has been approved and entered in the official registrar on April 13 th , 2018, it seems that the IP holder doesn’t plan to lose any time. A Reddit thread popped on May 25 th , a little over a month after the trademark had been registered, posted by a person who says that he has been served with a cease and desist order to refrain from furthering his conduct.\nThe user says that he has been selling T-shirts on Etsy. Some of his items seem to be related to cryptocurrency and Bitcoin , carrying the BTC logo on them.\nWhat is more, the user has attached a redacted version of the letter, outlining the demands of the trademark holder, which includes surrendering all trademark-infringing stock and profits made to the trademark holder.\nThere’s no further clarity on the matter and it remains questionable how a seemingly unknown company has managed to land a trademark on one of the hottest, mainstream terms in the last year. Community reaction has definitely been on the side of the Etsy seller, which is fitting due to the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency .\nDo you think “Bitcoin” is a term which should be eligible for trademark registration?

They “fully expect blockchain technology to achieve widespread, mainstream adoption in these sectors sooner rather than later.” But their research shows that long-term, sustainable success is only possible through careful planning and scheduled work programs.\nThe capability of blockchain to track, trace, and authenticate products, record contracts, guarantee the movement of information and record transactions means it can be put to use across the entire value chain. The benefits are consequently being passed on to the consumer in the form of savings, increased trust and transparency, and safer and higher quality products.\nPractical applications of blockchain\nThey delineated data into three use-case groups that distinguish between the reasons for the blockchain application:\nConsumer – Improving and protecting the consumer experience\nSupply-chain – Improving process efficiencies across the supply chain\nPayments and contracts – Improving transaction processes and ensuring the validity and implementation of contracts\nAssessing opportunities and responding to blockchain\nBusinesses need to understand how much blockchain can generate additional commercial value and how it aligns with the overall business strategy. Depending on the strategic objectives of the enterprise, there are four segments of impact:\nTrial projects - Opportunities that have a lower immediate value relative to others due to a narrower blockchain application\nExplore - Opportunities relative to trial projects in terms of value but similar complexity (and cost), offering greater value relative to investment in the short-term\nWait and see - Opportunities that currently offer a lower value relative to other blockchain opportunities and are more complex (and costly) to implement\nPlan - These offer the most attractive opportunities in terms of potential value\nBlockchain is not a cure-all, but should be used as a tool to achieve strategic goals. This is the key to seeing a tangible valueadd from this emerging technology. Consumer focused businesses that have the resources and capabilities should be considering how they can harness the power of it.\nEPAZ\nNews: Deloitte #Blockchain\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

May 29, 2018 105\nBitcoin , as the first and the original coin representing a prototype of a blockchain-based digital asset that has set all standards for the future coins that came after BTC several years later, seems to be registered as a trademark. That is no wonder as all teams have registered their ICOs while branding their ledgers, assets, and platforms in order to make the rights to these assets visible to the eye of the public. Now, Bitcoin has been a long-term favorite of many crypto enthusiasts and programmers, however, the person who registered Bitcoin seems to have nothing in common with the blockchain industry or Bitcoin.\nWho Registered Bitcoin?\nEverything started out when a merchant on the well-known online shop, called Etsy, was notified that he will be pursuit by the law in case he continues to sell t-shirts with the name Bitcoin on it.\nThe merchant got a letter that stated that IP-Holdings will be legally pursuing him in the following period unless the merchant doesn’t pull the t-shirts out of the sale on Etsy. The t-shirts were being sold to Bitcoin fans and had Bitcoin logo and name on it.\nIt seems that the mentioned merchant did have to stop with his offer on Etsy as IP-Holdings, which is a London-based company that doesn’t have anything to do with Bitcoin, has registered Bitcoin as their trademark and branded the coin as the original property of IP-Holdings.\nOne is for certain and that is that whoever stands behind the IP-Holdings, can’t possibly be the father of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who should be the only rightful owner of the first digital coin ever to be issued.\nHowever, it is a commonly known case that no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and those who might hold some information are keeping their silence for 10 years already.\nSo, it is less likely that we are going to find out who stands behind this alias any time soon.\nBut, as Satoshi Nakamoto is nowhere to be found, and has no interest in branding his own creation, it seems that anyone could have done that instead of them.\nIP-Holdings seem to be one of the rare companies that made it in this devour.\nThat means that the brand of Bitcoin is now an official trademark of IP-Holdings, in accordance with the information found at the British Intellectual Property Office.\nThere you can find the information that Bitcoin is registered under the number UK00003279106, which means that the name of Bitcoin officially belongs to the London-based IP-Holdings.\nWhether the company is lawfully entitled to trademark this brand despite the acceptance from the British Intellectual Property Office, still remains to be discovered.\nBefore this company has successfully registered Bitcoin as their own trademark in December 2017, two more companies, one based in London and the other in Russia, tried to list Bitcoin as their trademark back in 2015, but have failed in doing so, since their request was denied.\nSo, why IP-Holdings stand for the first company ever that has made it with successfully registering Bitcoin as their trademark?\nThe Bitcoin Foundation replied to this case that they believe that the name of Bitcoin shouldn’t be owned by anyone, which is in the spirit of the decentralized nature of this digital asset.\nRegardless of their opinion, IP-Holdings are sending letters to anyone using the brand of Bitcoin, threatening with lawsuits and claiming their rights.\nIt does make you mad unless of course, you have anything to do with IP-Holdings.\nHow is Bitcoin doing at the Current Moment?\nBitcoin seems to be hitting low for the past couple of days, especially now when we can see it falling below the price of 7.500$ per one unit, which is probably the lowest of BTC we have seen in a while.\nStill ranked as the top coin according to the global coin ranking list, BTC is currently dropping due to the most recent market trend, while it is trading in the red.\nFollowing the latest change in the market, Bitcoin can be traded at the price of 7.152$ per one unit, which is obviously still far from its all-time high of over 20.000$ per one unit, which also marked the golden period for this crypto.\nNow, for a reason still unknown, we can see it falling far below its all-time high while the dropping is interrupted only with an occasional bounce off that doesn’t last more than 24 hours as per the usual case in the last couple of weeks.\nDo you believe Bitcoin will be able to retain its old glory when it comes to its price in the market and the market demand?\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

We cover these opinions in today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Of course, positive predictions are almost always balanced by some negative expectations; in this case they are part of a short-term prognosis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints\nMcAfee Sees Bitcoin Beyond $15,000 in June Soon after tweeting that \"institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,\" cybersecurity guru John McAfee issued another bullish prediction. Focusing on short term analysis this time, which he admits is not his favorite, he turns attention to several events that may influence the cryptocurrency market – which, in his words, \"will turn before June 12.\"\nAccording to McAfee , the \"Korea deal is done and Trump will sign the documents in Singapore on 12 June […] The various noises being made are propaganda for domestic consumption,\" he notes. After Singapore, the software businessman expects a visit by the US President to Japan, where \"talks on creating a gold backed US currency will commence.\"\nBitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicts. His post also features several altcoins like golem, docademic, bezop, bitcoin private, and EOS. McAfee, who is a known supporter of cryptocurrencies and their adoption, has previously stated that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million per coin by the end of 2020.\nIn recently recorded video , the internet security expert also talks about \"the war we are all engaged in.\" The banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto, in his judgement. In a rather calm tone, McAfee advises crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. John McAfee calls on his followers to also write the SEC and ask \"to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.\"\nBitcoin Still a Buy, Good for Store of Value McAfee is not alone in the optimists' camp. According to blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart, bitcoin is still worth buying, despite its continued losses. The increased number of use cases is a proof that BTC is becoming more institutionalized, he told CNBC . \"Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,\" Bogart said, noting that banks are either going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform, or are opening up a trading desk. Spencer Bogart advised investors to sell coins like cardano, tron, IOTA and NEO, but said they should hold cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum, ripple, and EOS.\nAccording to Matt Hougan, Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, the most compelling use case for bitcoin today is as a store of value, although he admits the idea is often dismissed because of the volatility of the cryptocurrency. \"Gold is solid. Bitcoin is volatile. It'll never work – these statements are ignorant of gold's history and devoid of imagination,\" Hougan recently wrote in an op-ed piece for Forbes .\n\"Before 1971, the US dollar was hard-backed by gold, and gold's value was effectively vouchsafed by the full faith and credit of our government. When Richard Nixon took the US off of the gold standard, it set gold loose from its moorings,\" Matt Hougan explains. \"What followed was a period of huge volatility, as gold fought to establish itself as an independent store of wealth. In 1974, for instance, gold bullion prices rose 73%, before falling 24% in 1975. In 1981, gold lost 33% of its value, after being up 121% just two years prior,\" he details.\nRussian Experts Expect Further Decline in Prices Crypto experts contacted by Russian media are not so optimistic, at least in the short run. The value of bitcoin core (BTC) will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold, they claim. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $7,450, while bitcoin cash (BCH) holds over $900.\nThe downward trend is largely due to decisions and statements made by regulators in a number of countries, points out Vladislav Antonov, analyst at Alpari. Several factors have caused the weakening of bitcoin, according to the expert. Recently, the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into supposed price manipulations in the cryptocurrency markets. News came out that authorities in India may impose 18 percent tax on crypto trading.\nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , Antonov also mentioned the crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects and suspicious crypto activities, part of the coordinated \" Operation Crypto-Sweep \" in North America. Another event that has influenced the prices is the expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25th.\nIgor Zartdinov, co-founder of the ICG crypto fund, says the decrease in the value of bitcoin occurs on a neutral-to-positive news background. He thinks that market manipulation is a possible explanation, as big players usually earn at the expense of small investors. \"That's what we are seeing now,\" Zartdinov believes.\nWhat are your predictions about the future of crypto markets?

Starting with transport, they’re offering something different to the norm — and have plans to expand into multiple other industries. Read on to find out how.\nMay 29th, 2018. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: Beldex’s first offering is a taxi booking service with the ability to autonomously set price rates for different places at different times. The power of a decentralized taxi service utilizing blockchain technology creates new efficiencies as prices are set by aggregating those offered by customers and approved by drivers.\nThis is just one of many examples of how big data and blockchain technology is reshaping our daily lives. With the release of its decentralized ecosystem. Beldex aims to create a wider range of use cases for cryptocurrency worldwide.\nThe Beldex team has worked to produce a cross functional and “outside the box” platform. This is done by transforming the already existing cryptocurrency ecosystem into something more practical.\nA Coin With as Much Privacy as You Need\nBeldex has produced a “privacy enabled” coin for its network, while evolving its untraceability features. As a result, Beldex Coin can be used for both traceable and untraceable transactions. The coin itself has multifaceted uses on the Beldex platform.\nWhat is Beldex Ecosystem?\nThe Beldex ecosystem includes the taxi service named Bel Trips, and a delivery service named Bel Needs for delivery even to far-flung local places. There’s also the Beldex Debit Card allows coin holders to spend their balances even with merchants outside the network. Together, all these form the Beldex ecosystem.\nCoin Utility and Privacy Technology\nLet’s take a look at the technology behind Beldex Coin: optional sender privacy is protected using Hexagonal Ring Xtensive Transactional Signatures, where the senders’ public keys forming the ring are mixed together, obfuscating the original sender. It utilizes the Schnorr algorithm using the Ed25519 curve. Transaction amounts themselves are also protected by ring confidential transactions, which morph the figures by multiplying them with a random number generator function. It uses Pedersen commitment for this process.\nBel Trips\nThe cab industry worldwide is valued at around $44 billion USD and has gained prominence from last 15 years, with a CAGR of 8.47%. It’s anticipated that a decentralized taxi cab service could double that in the next five to eight years, in terms of monetary value and CAGR.\nBel Needs\nThe concept of making deliveries to a widespread and hyper local consumer base has also been gaining attention as technology advances. This untapped market can be made more profitable with the advent of a decentralized platform, one that purely satisfies the barter-style needs of Beldex coin holders within the ecosystem.\nBeldex Debit Card\nBeldex Coin holds real value within the Beldex ecosystem, with the potential to make it more useful than local fiat currency. Both service providers and users will be able to hold, save and spend the coin with peace of mind.\nThe company’s vision is to ensure the coin remains liquid, and rewards coin holders in the Beldex user base. A pre-sale of the tokens kicked off on May 10th 2018. Anyone can purchase the coin and become a part of the wider Beldex ecosystem.\nStay tuned for more updates, as Beldex aims to continually conceptualize and develop value-added wins in the cryptocurrency sector, disrupting the status quo and introducing new innovations well into the future.\nVisit the Website – https://beldex.io/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://beldex.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "beldex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beldex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T20:48:01.109+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "772d44de7e8a3351965c9e896e66335c91c6a5d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmb2IPSW6I26PAB6q7jwxpvk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is it too late?

But the upward momentum, however minor, was welcome relief from the relentless tide of bad news that’s lately been the norm.\nAt mid-morning, bitcoin was up to $7,400 per single coin, up nearly three percent over the last 24 hours. Other coins in the top ten showed renewed vigor as well, with ether up more than five percent and Bitcoin Cash approaching a six percent gain. Litecoin, Ripple and Cardano (boosted more than 11 percent, the day’s major gainer) were also heading north on the price charts.\nThe only down notes were from EOS (down close to two percent) and TRON, which dipped less than one percent.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending May 29, 2018 at 1:00 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $8,345.94 on the Simex exchange at 3:25 pm yesterday. Simex saw $25,745,900 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $6,761.01 on Simex’s exchange at 4:31 am today. Simex’s 24 hour volume was $25,745,900.\nThe average price on the surveyed exchanges, as weighed by volume, was $7,218.11.\nVolatility was a bit above average, with the BlockTribune Volatility Index coming in at 55.9. A higher number indicates greater price volatility with 50 describing an average day.\nThese statistics were consolidated from 14 different exchanges. It includes only BTC/USD trades and only on those exchanges that had at least 1% of the total volume of BTC/USD trades during the measurement period.

The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.\nAs a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtow n, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum .\nBut as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost.

I just browsed the r/cryptocurrency sub and every other comment in just about every thread are \"redditors\" questioning cryptocurrency as a whole. R/bitcoin is a wasteland of memes, censorship, propaganda and bot voting. R/btc lately is filled by what I recognize as buttcoiners, ie commenters who obviously don't care about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, sound money or liberty at all yet manage to hang around here all day posting nonsensical bullshit and slander. Interesting threads are buried while stupid memes and bullshit controversies are upvoted. This sub is barely functioning and the regular commenters barely manage to outweigh the shills and bots.\nTo me it is obvious that TPTB (The Powers That Be) recognize Bitcoin Cash as a great threat to their infinite money supply and control over information.\nAs the threat grows, TPTB will be even more desperate and places like Reddit and Twitter will become totally useless for discussion. Armies of basement dwellers or third world labour will be joined by a new industry of AI specifically aimed at swaying peoples minds with advanced psychological warfare. Bots and shills will outweigh us by 10:1.\nThe silver lining is that by destroying legacy social media they are only accelerating the rise of incentive based, uncensorable media like yours.org, memo.cash or blockpress.com. The power in these tools for spreading truth and value is enormous. It just blows my mind. To me, this is the Internet fully coming to bloom. All the middle men, all the censors, the statists, the leeches and rent seekers will fall to the ground like dead flies. A new bright age or renaissance of the internet if you will.\nSo to conclude this second language rambling: This is good for Bitcoin, and by that I mean Bitcoin Cash. BTC (my first love, now only an empty ticker symbol) is fucked. Even if they managed to remove the all encompassing tumours of 1Mb limit, Segwit, RBF, Core and Blockstream, there's no way they can turn the ship around or get back the community of productive developers and users. Meanwhile, BCH community has been vaccinated against all the failures of BTC. Satoshis invention is alive and kicking and stronger than ever. Look at all the great stuff happening in BCH. It's a great time to be alive I say, and those of us who are here in these early days are very lucky.

Their value also fluctuates like shares.\nCastle Craig Hospital in West Linton has been inundated with inquiries about helping people addicted to trading in the modern currency and is treating it in the same way as gambling addiction. 'Like a slot machine'\nMichael Parsons is a Bitcoin expert.\nHe told BBC Scotland's Stephen Jardine Programme why this modern activity has become addictive: \"I think because Bitcoin entered the mainstream last year and it went up ten times in value, people have a fear of missing out and want to jump in.\n\"They are incorrectly looking at the historical rise of Bitcoin and think that will be repeated - which it may be or may not be - so they are buying purely on speculation and not on understanding.\"\nHe said the practice is based on hope - like putting money into a slot machine.\n\"Bitcoin has gone up ten times last year, over the last 12 months it's gone up 240%, in the last month it's gone down by 23% and today it went down almost 3% itself,\" he said.\n\"People are looking at the wild fluctuations and thinking they have to jump on the bandwagon and perhaps make some money out of it.\" What is cryptocurrency?\nThere are now thousands of different crypto-currencies, but Bitcoin is still the best-known.\nBitcoin has no notes or coins: it is digital and largely exists online and it is not issued by governments or traditional banks.\nBitcoins are created through a complex process known as \"mining\", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.\nIt was reported in January 2018 that the total value of all cryptocurrencies was almost £500bn\nIt is estimated there are between 13 and 28 million active users of cryptocurrencies in the world today.

We see this as potentially large.\"\nHe said: \"You have the elements of poor regulation, an air of mystery about it, and the idea of gambling can seem a sort of noble thing to do.\n\"That and the combination of potential huge gains is really attractive to a lot of people who would never dream of any other addictive activity.\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Bitcoin's value has been very volatile during its nine-year history\nHe says the gravity of this potential issue cannot be underestimated.\n\"This is an addiction and illness that causes a lot of people to end up in despair, even suicide, so it has to be taken very seriously and people need to take practical measures,\" he said.\nChris explained the warning signs to look out for: \"They are quite obvious.

(Photo: Bitcoinist.net) Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 per cent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.\nClick on Deccan Chronicle Technology and Science for the latest news and reviews .

Their value also fluctuates like shares.\nCastle Craig Hospital in West Linton has been inundated with inquiries about helping people addicted to trading in the modern currency and is treating it in the same way as gambling addiction. 'Like a slot machine'\nMichael Parsons is a Bitcoin expert.\nHe told BBC Scotland's Stephen Jardine Programme why this modern activity has become addictive: \"I think because Bitcoin entered the mainstream last year and it went up ten times in value, people have a fear of missing out and want to jump in.\n\"They are incorrectly looking at the historical rise of Bitcoin and think that will be repeated - which it may be or may not be - so they are buying purely on speculation and not on understanding.\"\nHe said the practice is based on hope - like putting money into a slot machine.\n\"Bitcoin has gone up ten times last year, over the last 12 months it's gone up 240%, in the last month it's gone down by 23% and today it went down almost 3% itself,\" he said.\n\"People are looking at the wild fluctuations and thinking they have to jump on the bandwagon and perhaps make some money out of it.\" What is cryptocurrency?\nThere are now thousands of different crypto-currencies, but Bitcoin is still the best-known.\nBitcoin has no notes or coins: it is digital and largely exists online and it is not issued by governments or traditional banks.\nBitcoins are created through a complex process known as \"mining\", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.\nIt was reported in January 2018 that the total value of all cryptocurrencies was almost £500bn\nIt is estimated there are between 13 and 28 million active users of cryptocurrencies in the world today. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Baroness Michelle Mone explains why her venture was attracted to Bitcoin\nIts value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for.\nThere is no registry linking real names to addresses, which helps some Bitcoin users to protect their anonymity.\nBitcoin \"wallets\" operate like privately-run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.\nThe anonymity afforded by digital currencies has attracted people wanting to make illegal purchases on the internet.\nA growing number of businesses - including a property venture launched by Scots businesswoman Michelle Mone - now allow customers to buy goods and services with Bitcoin.\nThe man who helps cryptocurrency addicts is Castle Craig therapist Chris Burn.\nHe told BBC Scotland the attraction is the same as for those who are pulled into gambling: \"It is a kind of a bubble situation that is very exciting for people, particularly for compulsive gamblers, because excitement is a big part of any addiction. We see this as potentially large.\"\nHe said: \"You have the elements of poor regulation, an air of mystery about it, and the idea of gambling can seem a sort of noble thing to do.\n\"That and the combination of potential huge gains is really attractive to a lot of people who would never dream of any other addictive activity.\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Bitcoin's value has been very volatile during its nine-year history\nHe says the gravity of this potential issue cannot be underestimated.\n\"This is an addiction and illness that causes a lot of people to end up in despair, even suicide, so it has to be taken very seriously and people need to take practical measures,\" he said.\nChris explained the warning signs to look out for: \"They are quite obvious. You may be making a profit on your trading but if you are spending 16 hours a day staring at a computer you may be losing an awful lot of other elements in your life - friendships, work, exercise. You may be damaging yourself in ways you are not aware of.\n\"People can get extremely anxious and display physical symptoms - sweating, shaking, unable to sleep, really serious physical symptoms.\"\nDetails of organisations offering information and support with addiction are available at bbc.co.uk/actionline or you can call for free, at any time to hear recorded information on 08000 155 947.

The cryptocurrency’s technical charts saw a doji candle on Sunday, signaling short-term bearish exhaustion.\nHowever, a corrective rally remained elusive as bitcoin ran into offers above $7,400 and closed (as per UTC) at $7,143 – the lowest daily close since April 12, according to Bitfinex. Prices continued to drop today, with bitcoin hitting a 7-week low of $7,040 this morning.\nAt time of writing, the price was at $7,130. The losses signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900 – a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost.\nIf they can’t, prices may go as low as $5,000. BTC created a bearish outside-day candle on Monday.\nThese occur when a high is above the previous day’s high and the low is below the previous day’s low. In simple terms, it means trading on Monday started with optimism and ended with pessimism.

Massive price swings occur on a regular basis and cause a fair bit of negative market pressure. One of the main questions is whether or not there is effectively any degree of Bitcoin price manipulation taking place. The proof is in the pudding, but it remains difficult to say for sure. The Wild Bitcoin Price Swings\nOver the past nine years, there have been many debates regarding the Bitcoin price . It is an extremely unstable market, which tends to see ups and downs when people least expect it. To some users, this is a clear sign of market manipulation. Others see it as “another day at the office”. In a lot of cases, the BTC price is fluctuating for no apparent reason at all.\nFinancial markets, in general, seem to be prone to manipulation. It has happened before, and it will continue to happen for some time to come. People with a lot of money to spend will look for any way to improve their portfolio. This is no different in the world of cryptocurrency, which is perhaps even easier to manipulate, to a certain degree.\nMore specifically, all cryptocurrencies have a rather low market cap. Albeit $150 billion sounds pretty steep for Bitcoin, it is a small market compared to traditional assets. Anyone looking to influence cryptocurrency prices will effectively manipulate the markets whenever they see fit. Proving this is done on a large scale, however, will always remain rather challenging. The Manipulation Will not Stop\nThe US Justice Department is looking into Bitcoin price manipulation right now. Whether or not they will find anything out of the ordinary, remains to be seen. Even so, indicting anyone for this manipulative behavior will pose another big problem. Large holders of Bitcoin can effectively influence the market with a few clicks of a button, but that isn’t necessarily nefarious intent.\nVery few people benefit from a lower Bitcoin price. Miners need a specific BTC value to break even, let alone make a profit. Large holders of Bitcoin are not inclined to see their portfolio value drop either. Exchanges have no real benefit from a lower Bitcoin price either. As such, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence regarding cryptocurrency price manipulation. Not enough to effectively change this situation overnight, unfortunately.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Rest assured the manipulation will not stop, for better or worse. Those driving the price down will continue to do so until they are satisfied. The ultimate objective of doing so remains a bit unclear at this stage. An uneasy Bitcoin price situation will remain in place for quite some time to come.\nImage from Shutterstock Bitcoin Price Manipulation Steers World’s Top Crypto in Difficult Direction was last modified: May 29th, 2018 by JP Buntinx ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:06:11.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "399652c665c92863b470a2581207823d3c90ac43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn79sXq.JtY8kkTE7HGFszYeRVPXbU4PGpfym86TD8WQHFWKD4bFrHXBJjuMsaP7xq2Fy8VGFcISMLcZ6pnBMQ.XQeDzgXDYrT_", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Fork Renamed ”Bitcoin Core” Seemingly To Cause Maximum Confusion", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Fork Renamed ”Bitcoin Core” Seemingly To Cause Maximum Confusion : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-05-29T15:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "399652c665c92863b470a2581207823d3c90ac43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn79sXq.JtY8kkTE7HGFszYeRVPXbU4PGpfym86TD8WQHFWKD4bFrHXBJjuMsaP7xq2Fy8VGFcISMLcZ6pnBMQ.XQeDzgXDYrT_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "haumeris28", "published": "2018-05-29T15:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Fork Renamed ”Bitcoin Core” Seemingly To Cause Maximum Confusion", "text": "submitted by /u/haumeris28\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://toshitimes.com/bitcoin-cash-fork-renamed-bitcoin-core-seemingly-to-cause-maximum-confusion/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T13:00:14.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4ffeb5a5fd1b0c955e4513768d95bb497f936c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWJWXpD4rGXZFRUbDNk6iho-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Money for school fees.

Peter said he thinks we’re seeing a lot of movement in a number of markets that are counter to the long-term trends. For instance, oil dropped late last week, but he expects it’s long-term trend to continue upward. The dollar has picked up strength, but the broader trend is toward a weaker dollar. And bond yields fell, but the overall trajectory for interest rates is up.\nLISTEN\nHighlights from the Podcast\n“I think this is more technical noise. I don’t think the uptrend in the price of oil has changed based on this pullback from 73 now to 67-and-a-half. Maybe we have a little bit more downside but if you look at the chart, you can barely see the decline … I’m still bullish on oil.”\n“It’s not a coincidence that both [bond] yields and oil prices are falling at the same time because they rose at the same time, which also makes sense. If inflation is driving up oil prices, then inflation should also be driving up interest rates. And that’s exactly what we’ve been experiencing in these markets. And just as I think the upward trend in oil is intact, I think the upward trend in interest rates is intact.”\n“I think the dollar is going to run into some resistance. I thought it might have already happened. Maybe it’s going to go a little higher, but to me, the primary trend is down. We are in a bear market. The bear market started in January of last year, but there’s always corrections in every market whether it’s bull or bear. In this case, if I’m right, this is early in a dollar bear this is one of the first corrections – the correction being the up-move and it’s sowing the seeds of its own destruction.”\n“I think the renewed optimism about the Fed hiking rates I think will soon give way to the new reality that they’re almost finished raising rates, and they’re not going to be able to raise rates nearly as much as the markets once believed.”\n“Bitcoin has probably lost more value this week than any of the emerging market currencies.”\n“The cryptos currencies did not do what they are marketed to do. This is when they’re supposed to shine, right? If you’re in an emerging market and your currency is going down, you’re supposed to buy the cryptos as a hedge. But that’s not happening. I mean, maybe somebody did buy Bitcoin as a hedge, but the hedge didn’t work out. If somebody sold their fiat currency on Monday and bought into Bitcoin, they jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire, because chances are Bitcoin went down by more than the currency they were worried about.”\n“What’s interesting about this decline that we’ve had (in Bitcoin) is that there hasn’t been any big panic. It’s just been a slow meltdown. And there have been plenty of rallies along the way, but they sell into every rally and it’s just a slow erosion of the price of Bitcoin.”\n“Overall, the immediate effect of tariffs would be to raise the cost of cars, and that is not going to bode well politically, so I don’t think the tariffs are going to happen.”\n“The question is what does more damage to the economy? The deficits or the tariffs? Because they both do damage. I mean personally, I would think that the deficits would actually do more damage, but that damage is more long-term. The more immediate damage is probably the taxes, right? Because we have some immediate benefit to the economy of the tax cuts, long-term we’re going to have problems. The tax cuts are going to be a net negative because they led to bigger deficits, which in the long-run are a bigger problem for the economy than the tax cuts are a solution. But the same thing would apply if we had tariffs.”\n“Every time there is a government program, it’s here forever.”\n“I want taxes as in-your-face as possible so when a politician raises taxes, the taxpayers immediately see it and they know that they’re the ones paying it because then politicians will be less like to pass a tax that’s going to hit in a very obvious way their constituents.”\n“My dad always described government aid as being a blood transfusion from your right arm to your left arm and you spill half the blood on the floor.”\n“And the point is, had 10 or 20 people died in this restaurant, it would have been a huge story. It would have been all over the news. And what would the consequence had been? ‘We need to ban guns.’ And at the very least we need more gun control. But you would have had a lot of people coming out saying, ‘We need to ban guns! Guns kill! We need to outlaw guns!’ Well, in this case, guns didn’t kill, unless you count the shooter. Guns saved lives. These guns saved the lives of all the people in that restaurant who might otherwise have been shot had these other people not had guns to intervene.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter schiff potpourri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter schiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:40:34.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "016ae47ba7be12477fb9fee2831077aa9b47b3f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg..cZ_unWETCItABcYtl87EdpoEbIEIFUlT0rTwfuAe1E_Y889gzJyrevqLMmfFAKKnGVxTu04cZHQTnqCHQa2WBKxTaHFBlpsAnvW_OAfBCg--", "site_full": "wonderfulengineering.com", "site": "wonderfulengineering.com", "site_section": "http://wonderfulengineering.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Wonderful Engineering", "title": "600 Computers Stolen In World’s Biggest Bitcoin Theft", "title_full": "600 Computers Stolen In World’s Biggest Bitcoin Theft", "published": "2018-05-29T15:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/30931037323_02b6e84d96_b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20017, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "016ae47ba7be12477fb9fee2831077aa9b47b3f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg..cZ_unWETCItABcYtl87EdpoEbIEIFUlT0rTwfuAe1E_Y889gzJyrevqLMmfFAKKnGVxTu04cZHQTnqCHQa2WBKxTaHFBlpsAnvW_OAfBCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Admin", "published": "2018-05-29T15:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "600 Computers Stolen In World’s Biggest Bitcoin Theft", "text": "\nBitcoin has enjoyed a lot of popularity in the news recently, with the volatility of the cryptocurrencies worth and the passion of the dedicated fan-base ensuring constant front-page attention. As with any potentially immensely profitable pursuit, Bitcoin mining has recently entered an age where theft of computer mining farms is not only a risk, it is an inevitability. This has been the case in Iceland recently, where thieves stole 600 powerful computers specifically designed to act as dedicated miners, worth around $2 million in total. In fact, this might indicate the risk of a much greater trend.\n“Bitcoin statistic coin ANTANA” (CC BY-SA 2.0) by antanacoins Mainstream Criminality\nStealing computers is generally not a simple task. They can be unwieldy and their multitude of cables make them a pain to manage. To steal 600 of them at once, even if they were standardised and set in an efficient array, is a time consuming and physically difficult task, yet one which the thieves in question managed to pull off.\nThe reason for this lies in the market itself, and the difficulty which cryptocurrency enthusiasts face when attempting to generate, or mine, a currency of their own. While the initial stages of a cryptocurrency allow for the relatively simple mining of these coins, an increasing user and miner-base mean that each following coin will prove slightly more difficult and time-consuming to unearth. This is why these Bitcoin server farms exist in the first place, as for any individual or group to realistically make a profit from mining Bitcoin today requires a coordinated effort among hundreds of active computer systems.\n“Hacker stealing information” (CC BY 2.0) by cafecredit\nThis is further aided by the fact that these systems often include powerful graphics cards, which are some of the best-dedicated calculator pieces which can work with cryptocurrency mining software. In fact, there have been hardware shortages reported recently for gamers which have come about by cryptocurrency miners buying all the stock for which they were not ostensibly built. A Modern Problem\nAs Bitcoin still enjoys a huge worth, it is very likely that this type of theft will be repeated in the future. While in the case, some 11 people were arrested for the crime, there are other types of Bitcoin illegality which prove more difficult to detect. Specifically, malware based Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency miners are becoming increasingly popular, sneaking their way onto devices and using a portion of the computing power to send fractions of coins back to the end user. Thankfully, in cases like these, there are many antivirus programs which can protect the user, and there are plenty of review sites to help you read more…\nIn the case of physical thefts, like this one, then the thieves have a real problem in long-term anonymity simply owing to the nature of these large-scale computer systems. For one thing, cryptocurrency mining requires an enormous supply of electricity , so simply relocating the involved devices would allow authorities to track their location through checks of local power draws. In the case that these are stripped for parts, as you might see in a vehicular chop-shop, there still remains an issue of serial numbers and hardware signatures which need to be removed one-by-one.\nOf course, as this sort of theft becomes better known within the criminal world, it is only natural that there will be solutions to these problems discovered and enacted. Another piece of tech to worry about losing, so if you are the type to engage in any type of mining beyond small-scale, we would recommend keeping that information to yourself and using a developed security system.

Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency or digital currency. It is now considered as a worldwide payment system. Launched in the year 2009, this cryptocurrency works using a peer-to-peer network. With the help of this network, the users can make the transactions directly without the intervention of a third party.\nAs of 2017, more than 5 million users use this cryptocurrency as their payment system. Yet another advantage of bitcoin is that it can be exchanged for other products, currencies, and services.\nBelow mentioned are some of the important facts about bitcoin in our current society. Unlike other transactions, bitcoin assures user anonymity. The transactions made by a bitcoin user will never be known to the world unless he/she exposes it to the world himself. It is similar to cash-only transactions. Nobody will be able to track you down from the payment made using bitcoin. The bitcoin address of each user changes after each transaction and hence, your identity will be 100% safe with this cryptocurrency. Opening an account in the bank can be a hassle at times. This does not happen in the case of bitcoin. You do not have to submit any address proof or other identity proofs to get a bitcoin address. Once you download the Bitcoin Wallet Program, a bitcoin address will be generated and you can start the transactions. Moreover, you can have unlimited number of bitcoin addresses in this system. Bitcoin is one of the cheapest and quickest transactions available today. Even today, we have to wait for days or even weeks for the international wire transfers. Whereas, bitcoin transactions will take only an hour to complete. Also, unlike the other conventional payment methods, Bitcoin transfers are cheaper. One of the most notable advantages of bitcoin transactions is that a third party will never interrupt the users during the transactions. Any bank, government or other financial sectors do not have the authority to stop a transaction happening via the bitcoin. As the transactions made using bitcoin cannot be tracked or interrupted, the users do not have to pay any sales tax for the purchases made. Bitcoin has all the advantages similar to an online transaction. People can use this service at any time and anywhere in the world as long as they have a solid internet connection. One of the main features of the bitcoin which makes it different from the other conventional payment systems is that no personal information of the user is required to initiate a transaction. Bitcoin prevents people from being vulnerable to identity thefts and other frauds. Once you become a bitcoin user, you will be given full control over your money. Nobody else will be allowed to take a decision with your money other than you. Just like the conventional currency system, you can invest and earn returns with bitcoin too. Bitcoin usually gives more interest compared to the other types of currencies. The yet another advantage of bitcoin is that you do not have to wait long to access the interest generated after the investment. There are no long-term plans for bitcoin investment. Hence, you can use the profit of the investment as soon as it is generated. Bitcoin is the easiest method of payment available today. Whenever you want to make a transaction or a purchase, your clients can scan the QR code in your Bitcoin Wallet app. You will not have to sign up, sign, or swipe your card while using bitcoin. If you use bitcoin, you will not have any risks of inflation. No excess currency will be issued during bitcoin transaction, which is one of the major factors of inflation. This will be beneficial for both the buyers and the sellers. All the bitcoin transactions are signed using an authentic digital signature. Only after this, it will be sent to the blockchain. Thus, the bitcoin app is the safest place where you can store your cryptocurrencies. The lower transaction fees of bitcoin make it an ideal payment system for the small-scale industries. By using digital currencies, they will be able to save more money and thereby earn more profits in their business.\nBitcoin is, hence, an important form of currency in the world. There is no better currency in this world which is cheaper than the cryptocurrency. We live in a world where we are always vulnerable to identity theft and frauds. Bitcoin is the one and only solution to save ourselves from all such mishaps. television The television is undoubtedly one of the most momentous inventions of the twentieth century.

Bitcoin's main attraction was as a tool of speculation. Even the most fervent believers argued everyone should buy and HODL rather than actually use it for any practical purpose. It's too volatile and expensive to actually use as a means of transaction. That means that, when it appears large appreciation is a thing of the past, bitcoin has nothing left in its favor. There's evidence we are at that point. In 2017, enthusiasm was fueled by the fact that bitcoin never went two months without making a fresh record. Now, it's been more than six months since a high was seen. And, given we're more than 60% below the most-recent peak, the situation isn't going to change soon. That means no imminent hype/excitement to encourage fresh followers into the world's first decentralized ponzi scheme. With higher global yields -- in the U.S., in EM, in the euro zone -- the opportunity cost of having your money tied up in bitcoin has risen significantly in recent months. When yields were rock-bottom, it was a nearly free bet with potential massive positive returns. Now, it's an increasingly path to losing value week in, week out, with little hope for any positive return. Technically, it looks sick. Two weeks ago, there was a death cross of the moving averages -- the first since Sept. 30 , 2015, when it was trading at $237. That was just before the ``Consensus'' bitcoin conference in NYC was supposed to spur the next rally ``to the moon'' -- yet no major bounce was managed. $7293 is the average price point of the past year, according to Bloomberg charts. Roughly, it suggests that below that point the majority of those who bought in to the mania late -- in the past year -- are offside. How long more will they sit there watching their wealth erode?

This is an attack on bitcoin -- not the concept of cryptocurrencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:40:06.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4278a819848333b0effce5e54b2bc7891e20462", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNBHBw3eHEt9SVNd8OMR9m0suoR845lWmPPiCzgariCfrVd4mk0UO6b7f2YPnU9ktw", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin is the Best Digital Currency to Buy: Spencer Bogart", "title_full": "Bitcoin is the Best Digital Currency to Buy: Spencer Bogart", "published": "2018-05-29T15:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4278a819848333b0effce5e54b2bc7891e20462", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNBHBw3eHEt9SVNd8OMR9m0suoR845lWmPPiCzgariCfrVd4mk0UO6b7f2YPnU9ktw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T15:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is the Best Digital Currency to Buy: Spencer Bogart", "text": "Bitcoin is the Best Digital Currency to Buy: Spencer Bogart\n/u/OnlineBlow\nsubmitted by /u/OnlineBlow\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spencer bogart bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "best digital currency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:35:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b206218a4308e7c6b9b9bab30a4aae2c5018e7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQTmHPMKqP6SBEmIv4pTor9XZKzcFCLx7CuG3ql7yiKXFPmB1Qqslx3XfgxTrFxtb5RzxH2omDVe8437wm8DNVbV0vN4pwiYhVbYrND7WcYBx9zD8F1BDwAWMtBaUXYVMXgDedsZkO1eTDeUNIO3.Ums5EDg6EBXBC3r7_PV0g.4.P1VhQEhGylE16YFLAHq_3VQVCpexz5rw--", "site_full": "verytastyfood.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://verytastyfood.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "RT @CryptoCoinsNews: London Police Seize £500,000 in Bitcoin from “Cyber Crime Wave” Hacker https://t.co/aHk9vmTYhR – Very Tasty Food", "title": "RT @CryptoCoinsNews: London Police Seize £500,000 in Bitcoin from “Cyber Crime Wave” Hacker https://t.co/aHk9vmTYhR", "title_full": "RT @CryptoCoinsNews: London Police Seize £500,000 in Bitcoin from “Cyber Crime Wave” Hacker https://t.co/aHk9vmTYhR", "published": "2018-05-29T15:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b206218a4308e7c6b9b9bab30a4aae2c5018e7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQTmHPMKqP6SBEmIv4pTor9XZKzcFCLx7CuG3ql7yiKXFPmB1Qqslx3XfgxTrFxtb5RzxH2omDVe8437wm8DNVbV0vN4pwiYhVbYrND7WcYBx9zD8F1BDwAWMtBaUXYVMXgDedsZkO1eTDeUNIO3.Ums5EDg6EBXBC3r7_PV0g.4.P1VhQEhGylE16YFLAHq_3VQVCpexz5rw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "verytastyfood", "published": "2018-05-29T15:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "RT @CryptoCoinsNews: London Police Seize £500,000 in Bitcoin from “Cyber Crime Wave” Hacker https://t.co/aHk9vmTYhR", "text": "London Police Seize £500,000 in Bitcoin from “Cyber Crime Wave” Hacker https://t.co/aHk9vmTYhR\n— CCN (@CryptoCoinsNews) May 28, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nfrom Twitter https://twitter.com/cryptosima\nMay 29, 2018 at 02:28PM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:33:35.045+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 21908, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=10300", "requestsLeft": 559}
