Latest figures from Square, however, show that is not necessarily the case. At least not in the short term.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Is Not Used by Organized Crime Says Hong Kong Government\nSQ Reports Strong Q1 Square Inc (NYSE:SQ), the developer of the mobile payment app Square Cash, has posted its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 on Wednesday, showing overall strong performance. Total net revenue was $669 million, up 45% year over year, and Adjusted Revenue was $307 million, up 51% year over year.\nDespite its impressive yearly growth, the company's stock price fell by about 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Many analysts attribute this drop in SQ shares to the disappointing figures the company presented via its bitcoin-related business. Bitcoin revenue contributed $34.1 million to total net revenue in the first quarter, but cost was $33.9 million resulting in a minor add to adjusted revenue of just $200,000.\nTaking the Long View Square CEO, Jack Dorsey, addressed questions about his take on the bitcoin business in the conference call with analysts following the release of the quarterly report. He thinks that the company has a very different customer base than the majority of bitcoin exchanges so they wanted to initially provide just a safe way to participate in the market. \"It's a demographic that typically would not be able to use other exchanges or would find those complicated and something that we wanted to make super easy, but at the same time, continue to protect and make it safe.\"\n\"In terms of the strategy long-term, the first step we wanted to take is to learn as quickly as possible, to offer something that people would find valuable. And the reason we started this initially is because we did see cash customers wanting to buy crypto, utilizing their cash accounts. So, we made that a little bit easier. But we want to learn what this meant for us as a company and also for our industry and really pushed ourselves a lot to make sure that we were best in class in terms of providing a simple easy of exchange and then we can build off of that.\"\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey in happier times. Answering a question about other potential uses for blockchain technology, the CEO said \"there is no other technology apart from artificial intelligence and machine learning and deep learning that affects the way we can operate our service and the way we can build our business. We've built a service that individuals can use, providing more access to more people around this technology and this implementation. And because we are connected directly to the blockchain and using it every single minute of every single day, we have been able to learn quite quickly and how it could impact the rest of our business as well.\"\n\"There is certainly a ton of applications around creating more efficiencies within our business, but also creating new opportunities as well. So, we are still in a learning phase of where we can apply it in the right way because we don't just want to purely apply the technology where it doesn't fit but making sure we are actually solving a real need and a real problem whether that be internal or external. But, we do have a lot of excitement for what it can do. And we are building a significant expertise within the company to do that.\"\nIs this a good opportunity for longer term stock investors add SQ to their portfolios? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, Square.\nDo you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread? Thought so. That's why we are building this online universe revolving around anything and everything Bitcoin. We have a store . And a forum .

The situation made worse by the negative news, so even ardent cryptocurrency enthusiasts have become despondent. However, at the moment there is mood swings in the market and it seems that the buyers are trying to dominate again.\nThe current fall is within the framework of the long-term layout of the new global growth in the second wave, while the price may drop almost to the beginning of the first. Critical point will be leaving below $ 6000 - this will mean scrapping the current picture, and for bears, targets below $ 5000 will open.\nbtc daily chart\nWe also need to close around $ 11,000. Achievement of this level will give hope to bulls on breaking of a downside trend and continuation of the upward movement. There are already less than two weeks to realize this scenario.\nIf we talk about short-term prospects, then, as predicted in the previous analysis, during the G20 meeting, volatility may greatly increase. Cryptocurrency investors could already observe the echoes of this, when today in a matter of hours the price of the first coin has increased by about 10%... https://en.bit.news/bitcoin-price-analysis/\nToday and tomorrow it is necessary to be especially attentive and not to make rash and impulsive transactions.\nYou can see that the price of bitcoin today has been very volatile when it dropped sharply from $ 9,400 to $ 8,800 at the moment, so the fluctuation of bitcoin has made the market very confusion, almost all of the coin are falling sharply. We can see that although bitcoin prices have been rising steadily over the past month and this may be a correction before continuing to increase, bitcoin prices are still in a bear market so you must have a commercial plan. specifically, to minimize risk.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.bit.news/bitcoin-price-analysis/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T09:38:45.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb2df152d93bb1ae0d0991dd871d1c72a26e44b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgQtoVZW8x3.T9ZajvAfoTnb2H.m1XCF.jddjyQQ9rlawCeLW1.siHR1aX.dSaljNP3N_iyhBHKBxreCXw8AXVAhT2R.MWsGjOjRs7H4auUpcDB622LlU6cbalj4P70ALi", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones", "title_full": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones", "published": "2018-05-11T11:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb2df152d93bb1ae0d0991dd871d1c72a26e44b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgQtoVZW8x3.T9ZajvAfoTnb2H.m1XCF.jddjyQQ9rlawCeLW1.siHR1aX.dSaljNP3N_iyhBHKBxreCXw8AXVAhT2R.MWsGjOjRs7H4auUpcDB622LlU6cbalj4P70ALi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-11T11:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones", "text": "Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese multinational communications technology company, has announced that mobile phone users will be able to download Bitcoin (BTC) wallets on new Huawei devices starting Friday, Bloomberg reported May 10.

How ICICI India Bank fucked me up!", "text": "This is why Bitcoin should be the ONLY global currency. How ICICI India Bank fucked me up!\n/u/Hodl_it\nFirst of all, Sorry for poor English.\nSo, I am a Non-Resident Indian customer of ICICI Bank Pvt Ltd India. I hold two NRI savings accounts, 1 insurance and 4 Fixed Deposits with them. I have never had any issues with them until the last 12 days. I thought I will share it with you guys so you all understand how shitty current Banking system is.\nMy Business Partner in Kenya made a transaction of $100,000 (USD) to my ICICI NRE account on April 30, 2018, which is my profits from investments in Kenya. His Bank processed the transaction on the same day and told him that the funds will reach ICICI account in 2-3 days time.\n3 Days went past and I called my Business partner and told him to collect SWIFT Transfer status copy from his Bank. On the SWIFT Transfer status copy, I could see that the transfer was successful but my ICICI Bank didn't credit the funds in the account.\nI called my friend in ICICI and asked for an explanation for the delay. They said it will be credited by next day and so I decided to give them a couple more days. I didn't hear from them for the next two days. No Phone calls, No Emails, No SMS. Nothing.\n6'th Day. I decided to call them again to ask what's going on because I needed the Funds urgently to make payment for a Property. This time they said it will be credited by today evening. I did get angry but I had no better choice than simply waiting for them to credit funds in my account.\nNothing happened by EOD but by midnight, I received an email from ICICI mentioning that the funds are on HOLD and I need to provide proof of Relationship with the Remitter and Purpose of Remittance. I immediately sent the proof needed. After 5 minutes I received an email saying that the service request has been received and it will be processed in 2 days. So I decided to wait.\n8'th day. I received another email from ICICI saying that the Service Request has been forwarded to the concerned party. I was like, WTF, I waited two days for this shit? So I immediately called the Bank directly to report a grievance. Again they said it will be processed in 2 days. Just like before...\n10'th day. Nothing yet, So I called ICICI Head Office asking for an update on the Grievance. This time they said that this will take another 2 more days because they have sent an email to the Remitter asking for the proof of Relationship with the Receiver and purpose of remittance and waiting for a response from him. I immediately called my Business partner and asked. He said he had responded to their email 1 day ago.\n13'th day. I gave ICICI Bank three more days to verify the emails, proofs, and credit the funds. Still nothing. I called ICICI again an hour ago. They said it will be credited by today evening or tomorrow if there are no other problems with the transaction.\nI really wished I could throw a punch on his face... Now, What I think could be the real reason f or the Delay is... ICICI 2018 Q1 Profits were down by 50% because of Bad Loans. They need funds in their accounts to keep the Bank running. They are probably holding on to my Money to lend-out to some other person or business and make some profit from it. They could have returned the fund by now if the proofs were not okay or there was some other problem with the transfer. I can only hope that they will release funds soon.\nThis is first and worst experience I have ever had with a Major Bank and from now on, I will promote Bitcoin with 100X more dedication. There should be only one Banking system and it should be Decentralized.\n-Hodl_it\nsubmitted by /u/Hodl_it\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

"From Tyler Durden : Shortly after FundStrat’s Tom Lee presented his thesis for why mining will take Bitcoin to $36,000 by the end of 2019, the crypto space suddenly kneejerked lower on notable volume.\nNo obvious catalyst for the move for now…\nThis drop comes as CoinTelegraph reports of new research from Fundstrat Global Advisors places Bitcoin prices at $36,000 by the end of 2019, co-founder Tom Lee revealed Thursday, May 10.\nAnalysis of the relationship between Bitcoin mining costs and price by Fundstrat’s Quantamental Strategist Sam Doctor has led the market research firm to predict the cryptocurrency’s range will fall between $20,000 and $64,000 by 2019 year end.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nThe calculations focused on Bitcoin Price to Mining Breakeven Cost Metric, known as P/BE, which Doctor says has “proven a reliable long-term support level.”\n“We expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple,” an executive summary of the findings uploaded to Twitter by cofounder Tom Lee reads.\nThe price target is broadly in line with Lee’s own recent prediction of $25,000 by the end of 2018.\nRemaining bullish on Bitcoin has characterized both Lee and Fundstrat in recent months, a previous survey in April revealing that 82% of institutional investors believed prices had already “bottomed out.”\nThe survey also contained a prediction question, with the highest number of respondents opting for a range of between $10,000 and $20,000 by the

In the third quarter of 2017, Huawei dominated the competitor landscape accounting for 19.4 of the market share according to a November report by IDC.\nBTC.com Mobile Wallet Features: Easy access to your Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash funds in a secure smartphone app. Adjust transaction fees according to priority Full control of your private keys, giving you complete control over your coins Multisignature keys: secure backup mechanism with BTC.com where user maintains control with two out of three keys.

Mr. Wensheng also discussed his investments in alternative cryptocurrencies, and compared the present state of the cryptocurrency sector to that of the internet of the early 2000s.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Is Not Used by Organized Crime Syndicates Says Hong Kong Government\nMeitu Founder Accumulates Approximately 10,000 in 2018 In a recent interview with entrepreneur Wang Feng, Mr. Wensheng revealed that his goal of owning 10,000 BTC had been achieved following extensive accumulation during the bear trend of 2018. \"When I clearly saw the future of blockchain and bitcoin, I set a goal for myself – owning 10,000 bitcoins, and now the goal has been achieved,\" he said.\nMr. Wensheng claimed that \"Back in this January I only had several bitcoins, just to follow the trend.\" Mr. Wensheng states that he then \"realized that blockchain and bitcoin are the future,\" leading to the entrepreneur to \"set the goal of accumulating 10,000 bitcoins.\"\nDespite being enticed by the meteoric gains made by the bitcoin markets in 2017, Mr. Wensheng patiently waited for the markets to retrace. \"Last December saw the great spike and I didn't buy any bitcoin at that time. Later when the price corrected to normal in January, I began the career by buying in bitcoins at low cost,\" he recounted.\nMindset Critical to Successful Investment Mr. Wensheng stated that in his view, \"the big difference between investment and speculation is the mindset. Suppose you buy in a stock share or a cryptocurrency but the price keeps falling after that, if you are an investor, you will be delighted at the stumble for it means good time to buy more in; on the contrary, if you keep complaining of the slowdown, no offense but I think you are actually a speculator.\"\nDespite his assertions surrounding the requisite psychology for successful trading, Mr. Wensheng emphasizes the need for new investors to exercise due diligence and caution when entering the markets. \"Of course, before you get started, thorough research and analysis is a must,\" he said.\nCai Wensheng Compares Cryptocurrency Markets to Early 2000's Tech Boom In the interview, Mr. Wensheng described the current state of the cryptocurrency markets to the boom and bust-prone internet sector of the early 2000's, stating \"It is the similar case with Internet in 2000, startups die away in batches when the Internet bubble burst back then, few made it. While if you bet the right one, the returns are beyond your imagination.\"\nMr. Wensheng states that he has \"invested in a dozen of blockchain projects,\" including \"Theta, Ontology, Cortex, Arcblock, Zipper, Yeecall, Dxchain, [and] Charter.\"\nSo far, Mr. Wensheng claims that \"some\" of his cryptocurrency investments have yielded \"fairly high returns and some are still losing money\" – describing the markets' performance as \"reasonable […] as blockchain is still in its early phase and practical applications are lacking, in this way, it needs more support and patience. In the long run, it's promising and time will tell.\"\nDo you agree with the comparison between the cryptocurrency markets and the tech boom of the early 2000's?

This way, he has allowed himself to earn an income without relying on traditional avenues. Boyart managed to earn revenues from his murals without needing an exhibition in a gallery.\nThe Bitcoin QR code was a part of a growing movement artists have been using to replace the need to depend on galleries and dealers, said a report on The Next Web . They are using crowdfunded services such as Ulule and Patreon. These services are providing artists with the opportunity to achieve improved financial independence.\nThat said, there remain challenges using these services as an alternative to more traditional revenue channels. While the opportunity is open for artists to earn on their own, there is still risk that their streams of revenue will be cut off at any moment. However, with the addition of cryptocurrencies and blockchains , an even smoother opportunity has opened up. It allows them to separate themselves from corporations and deal directly with those who would support them. That’s why Pascal “PBOY” Boyart added a Bitcoin QR code to his murals.\nThe French street artist drew the attention of the digital currency world by offering creatives a new and viable option for bringing in an income. In this way, they take their income directly through their pieces. They can skip over anyone else in the middle who would take their share of the artist’s profit.\nRedditors came together to tip their hats to Boyart for his clever use of the QR code mobile payment method . Many of them approved of the way one of his pieces rose to the top of the Bitcoin subreddit discussion board. Several of the social media platform’s users took their opportunity to applaud him for using both QR codes and bitcoins as well as he did.\nThe Bitcoin QR code made it possible for people walking by the murals to scan and make a donation. It didn’t take long before he’d already earned over $1,000 using this technique.

S. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco the Launch of Bitcoin Futures is in the last year for the price fall at the beginning of the year is partly responsible. Of optimists, pessimists, supply, demand, and the need to use Bitcoin.\nNow it is official – the carnage in January, among other things, to the Launch of the futures contracts in December 2017. What we reported back in January, now confirmed by a study from researchers from around the U. S. Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco.\nIn December of last year to the upturn in the Bitcoin Ecosystem. The CBOE and the CME brought together the Bitcoin world with the traditional financial system. With the Bitcoin Futures, it should now be possible to benefit from the fluctuations in the Bitcoin price, without the need for the crypto-currency itself. What was also new: You could also benefit from a lower rate. With the futures contracts, one could speculate on the price – after purchasing the financial products, and a proper evaluation could be rich profits. Regardless of whether the price rose or fell. Study of the U. S. Federal Reserve Bank sees Parallels with the real-estate bubble\nThe team of researchers from the U. S. Federal Reserve Bank to recognize this as a Parallel to the real-estate bubble in the United States at the beginning of the Millennium. You can see in the strong price increase of Bitcoin and his case after the surrender of the Futures by the CME, a Parallel to the price developments, which had taken place in the financial theory.\nThese price dynamics follow a Trend in which the demand for a product for a financial instrument of optimists is directed, is to drive the price high as long, until the market introduces a mechanism, the pessimists allow to invest in the other direction:\n“And up to 17. December were this [optimistic] investors. As a self-fulfilling prophecy pushed optimists the price of Bitcoin in the amount and animated more and more people to join and the price high. The pessimists, however, had no mechanism to invest money in their views that the price would collapse.“\nWith the introduction of the Bitcoin Futures were now able to benefit from the pessimists. By predicting a price fall to a certain point in time, you could benefit with the futures of their forecasts. And for the time being you should keep right. First, the strong price came in December to increase at a rate of up to 20,000 US dollars, the Bitcoin is suddenly worth it. Only and then, until the beginning of February, back on up to $ 6,000 to sink. Those who had bet on had won.\nThe lead scientist of the continue to on the difference between speculative and transactional demand. This difference was apparently too high. The majority of investors speculating on high profits, while only a small part of the people Bitcoin is actually used (order to pay). And how to do it?\nThe researchers assume that the Bitcoin price will rise, if the transactional demand increases. In other words: If Bitcoin is actually used, it is also more value. This is also with the deflationary nature of the crypto-currency. Since the supply of Bitcoins is limited and the payout reduces steadily, you can increase the price with increasing use and increased demand in the end. In the end it all depends on a number of factors such as regulation, acceptance, supply and demand. So: Use Bitcoin!

Rather, \"a variety\" of associated products – the first of which will be Bitcoin futures – will grace the market first.\nExplaining the decision, which would make Goldman the first Wall Street bank to go for Bitcoin, Yared said some \"skepticism\" was still present, even among those in charge of creating the trading suite.\n\"I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,\" she continued. \"For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.\"\nA Bizarre Bitcoin U-Turn? Goldman first suggested its Bitcoin perspective was changing last month when its securities division hired trader Justin Schmidt.\nRegardless of the firmness of the plans, the news makes for surprising reading, coming from an industry that has traditionally been highly averse to cryptocurrency.\nThe negating of the \"fraud\" aspect of Bitcoin by Goldman is especially resonant, just eight months after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon infamously crashed markets by using the term in public, a move he later said he \"regretted.\"\nEven Goldman's own CEO Lloyd Blankfein claimed Bitcoin \"is not for him,\" however, a stance which Yared contrasted.\n\"It is not a new risk that we don't understand,\" she concluded. \"It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.\"\nThe bank's first step will be trading Bitcoin futures, something due to occur \"in the next few weeks.\"\nWhat do you think about Goldman Sachs' Bitcoin trading plans?

I decided to call them again to ask what's going on because I needed the Funds urgently to make payment for a Property. This time they said it will be credited by today evening. I did get angry but I had no better choice than simply waiting for them to credit funds in my account.\nNothing happened by EOD but by midnight, I received an email from ICICI mentioning that the funds are on HOLD and I need to provide proof of Relationship with the Remitter and Purpose of Remittance. I immediately sent the proof needed. After 5 minutes I received an email saying that the service request has been received and it will be processed in 2 days. So I decided to wait.\n8'th day. I received another email from ICICI saying that the Service Request has been forwarded to the concerned party. I was like, WTF, I waited two days for this shit? So I immediately called the Bank directly to report a grievance. Again they said it will be processed in 2 days. Just like before...\n10'th day. Nothing yet, So I called ICICI Head Office asking for an update on the Grievance. This time they said that this will take another 2 more days because they have sent an email to the Remitter asking for the proof of Relationship with the Receiver and purpose of remittance and waiting for a response from him. I immediately called my Business partner and asked. He said he had responded to their email 1 day ago.\n13'th day. I gave ICICI Bank three more days to verify the emails, proofs, and credit the funds. Still nothing. I called ICICI again an hour ago. They said it will be credited by today evening or tomorrow if there are no other problems with the transaction. I really wished I could throw a punch on his face...\nNow, What I think could be the real reason for the Delay is... ICICI 2018 Q1 Profits were down by 50% because of Bad Loans. They need funds in their accounts to keep the Bank running. They are probably holding on to my Money to lend-out to some other person or business and make some profit from it. They could have returned the fund by now if the proofs were not okay or there was some other problem with the transfer. I can only hope that they will release funds soon.\nThis is first and worst experience I have ever had with a Major Bank and from now on, I will promote Bitcoin with 100X more dedication. There should be only one Banking system and it should be Decentralized.\n-Hodl_it", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icici india bank", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "icici bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icici bank pvt ltd india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:27:09.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc9b3806e3c6c95fea8b686b676c416af3dbb6b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt0TTVIW0.4gW8NlqbLUr5lIWAiIXLkHlCAMAfM2rF6NJ45nrBaZgxFH6skxriofQRqPN8SVkbdtuETjuy5Zta_dJMp5dvDYudaQ.YgaVca_ULw6IHAVyMt7BWGDDam595x3mp3cN2bxfI8xGlejY_7GY.C4AxWOG6FL5pQA.a.kM", "site_full": "www.financialexpress.com", "site": "financialexpress.com", "site_section": "http://www.financialexpress.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Financial Express", "title": "This Warren Buffett ‘disciple’ says Oracle of Omaha is wrong in calling Bitcoin ‘rat poison’", "title_full": "This Warren Buffett ‘disciple’ says Oracle of Omaha is wrong in calling Bitcoin ‘rat poison’", "published": "2018-05-11T10:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2017/05/Warren-L-Reuters.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4726, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 24, "comments": 0, "shares": 24}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc9b3806e3c6c95fea8b686b676c416af3dbb6b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt0TTVIW0.4gW8NlqbLUr5lIWAiIXLkHlCAMAfM2rF6NJ45nrBaZgxFH6skxriofQRqPN8SVkbdtuETjuy5Zta_dJMp5dvDYudaQ.YgaVca_ULw6IHAVyMt7BWGDDam595x3mp3cN2bxfI8xGlejY_7GY.C4AxWOG6FL5pQA.a.kM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FE Online", "published": "2018-05-11T10:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Warren Buffett ‘disciple’ says Oracle of Omaha is wrong in calling Bitcoin ‘rat poison’", "text": "This Warren Buffett ‘disciple’ says Oracle of Omaha is wrong in calling Bitcoin ‘rat poison’ This Warren Buffett ‘disciple’ says Oracle of Omaha is wrong in calling Bitcoin ‘rat poison’ Even though this tech venture capitalist considers himself a ‘disciple’ of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, he doesn’t endorse latter’s views on the subject of Bitcoin. By: FE Online | Published: May 11, 2018 1:07 PM Palihapitiya said that Bitcoin is not correlated to the rest of the market. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\nEven though this tech venture capitalist considers himself a ‘disciple’ of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, he doesn’t endorse latter’s views on the subject of Bitcoin. “Not everybody is right all the time,” CEO, Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC. The knowledge about technology is not in the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO’s “circle of competence,” he also said. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett along company’s vice chairman Charlie Munger went on another bitcoin bashing spree this month at the firm’s annual shareholders meeting held last Saturday. Buffett said that bitcoin was “rat poison squared” and that cryptocurrencies would “come to a bad ending,” at the event.\nExplaining the complexity in understanding Bitcoin, Palihapitiya said that Bitcoin is not correlated to the rest of the market. Palihapitiya also added that he feels he is “in two different universes. I need a passport to go between the bitcoin world and the regular world.” The younger generation sees Bitcoin as replacement to gold, he said. “Bitcoin is replacement to traditional financial infrastructure,” he added.\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger are geniuses but “ in what they do,” he added. It’s important to remember what happened during the financial crisis, Palihapitiya said. “Everything broke down” and “things that we thought were hedges went away.” On Wednesday morning, Bitcoin that attracts huge criticism was around $9,275, according to industry site CoinDesk.\nBitcoin price has plunged significantly since the start of this year. For a brief period, in the later part of the last year, Bitcoin even touched $20,000-mark. The popular cryptocurrency is under huge pressure in wake of increasing regulatory crackdown in different parts of the world. Even back in India, RBI , recently banned of bitcoin trading and asked all the entities regulated by it to cut off ties with any such platforms in the given time period.\nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

The app store was launched in March and will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones. It will be rolled out to older devices in the coming months. The BTC.com wallet, which allows users to send, receive, and store bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, will be the first crypto app offered by Huawei, the world’s third-biggest mobile phone maker.\nThe move will likely have the most impact in the Chinese market, where Huawei is the biggest smartphone seller. While Chinese authorities shut down crypto exchanges and banned initial coin offerings (ICO), people are not forbidden from owning bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n“It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market,” Alejandro de la Torre, BTC.com’s vice president of business operations, said in an interview with Bloomberg. “The use of cashless payments with apps is very big, and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.”\nThe top smartphone maker by Chinese sales last year was Huawei, with shipments of 90.9 million and a market share of 20.4 percent, up from 16.4 percent in 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Huawei topped Chinese sales, with shipments of 24.3 million and a market share for the quarter of 21.3 percent, up from 16.8 percent in Q4 2016.\n“From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future,” Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services, said in a statement.\nIn March of this year, it was reported that Huawei is considering developing a smartphone that will be able to run blockchain applications. Last month, the company announced the launch of a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform to enable companies to develop smart contracts on top of a blockchain network for several use-case scenarios.

According to statements by Chinese officials, the People’s Republic is developing a national standard for blockchain technologies, which should be introduced next year. Also, the Zcash Foundation is taking steps to protect the network of the privacy coin from ASIC-based mining. Chinese giant Bitmain has recently launched its Antminer Z9 Mini designed to process transactions for cryptos like Zcash, which use the Equihash algorithm.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General China Preparing National Blockchain Standard\nChinese authorities are working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic.\nA national standard plan for blockchain is under preparation and respective departments will set up a national blockchain and distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Committee said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the Electronic Industry Standards Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Li Ming told the Economic Information Daily that the national blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards. He also added that the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future.\nAccording to a recent statement by Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, “The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp the global technological competition.” Yu Kequn also noted that blockchain technology is a new integrated application of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. “It has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, tamper resistance, and anonymity,” the official pointed out and added: “It can be applied in the production, management, and transaction chains, and it will bring the entire life cycle of restructuring to different areas, so that it can be managed and traceable.” Iceland’s Missing Mining Rigs May Have Been Found in China\nThe mining equipment which was stolen from data centers in Iceland several months ago might have reached China, according to media reports from the Nordic nation, which has attracted crypto miners with cheap energy and favorable conditions. At least 600 computers, graphics cards, motherboards, processors, and other hardware, worth an estimated $2 million, disappeared in a series of burglaries in December and January. Last month, Chinese authorities conducted a raid on a crypto mining farm in the city of Tianjin. According to local media, police have confiscated 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency in the illegal facility.\nThe suspected organizer of the heist in Iceland, Sindri Thor Stefansson, fled to Sweden after escaping from a low security prison in his country. He was recently arrested in Amsterdam and is now awaiting extradition to Iceland, where he is going to face trial. The ongoing investigation and the court proceedings are expected to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding one of the biggest burglaries in Iceland’s history. Tracing the stolen mining equipment is a priority for authorities trying to get to the bottom of this case. Their findings should prove or dismiss the media speculation around the possible connection between the two incidents. Zcash Opposes ASIC-Based Mining after Chinese Giant Launches Equihash Miner\nDevelopers of Zcash have stated that the struggle against ASIC-supported mining is a priority. They have indicated their opposition after the launch of a new application specific circuit designed to process transactions for the privacy coin. Zencash, a Zcash fork, has also announced plans to potentially change its algorithm for the same reason. Earlier in May, the Chinese mining giant Bitmain revealed the upcoming release of a new device that will be capable of working with the Equihash algorithm, which was itself introduced to prevent ASIC mining and is used by Zcash and other cryptos. ASICs were initially developed to mine mainly bitcoin. The highly specialized hardware is capable of handling the enormous number of calculations involved in the processing of its transactions.\nBitmain has a track record of successfully overcoming ASIC-resistant algorithms. The mining equipment producer has already developed powerful miners for many cryptocurrencies whose developers have tried to stop the centralization of hashing power. These include miners for the algorithms Ethash, used by the Ethereum network, and Cryptonight, used by Monero. The new Antminer Z9 Mini, developed to mine Zcash, Zencash, and others, offers a hashrate of 10k Sol/s. It was expected to hit the market in June, but according to the manufacturer, it can be ordered now. “To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we’ve set a limit of one miner per user,” Bitmain said in a tweet .\nThe management of the Zcash Foundation has decided to allocate resources to study the influence of ASIC mining on the network. An advisory council will be convened to provide a “scientifically grounded answer” to the problem. The team behind Zcash, however, may be forced to fight a war on two fronts, after researchers from the University College London recently found a vulnerability in the crypto’s algorithms. They believe that certain patterns in Zcash transactions significantly weaken its anonymity. The claim is that when the cryptocurrency is transferred from unprotected to protected addresses and then back again, the overall level of anonymity decreases significantly. Student Leaves China after Losing on Crypto Investments\nA Chinese college student has reportedly lost a small fortune by local standards due to unwise crypto investments and has already left the country in search of better opportunities to compensate the losses. Liu Ke, a sophomore in his twenties, used all his money to buy cryptocurrency, mostly aircoins, when markets were going up towards the end of last year. When cryptos were hitting their all-time highs, he spent a total of 140,000 yuan (~$23,000), including amounts he borrowed from online micro loan platforms like Alipay and Baidu. He even “invested” the money for his tuition fees. Liu Ke told the local outlet 8btc that he now lives and works in the Cambodian coastal resort Sihanoukville, where he hopes to earn more money to cover his debts.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s stories in Bitcoin in Brief?

This very interesting article draws the conclusion that the crypto market will surge, following the establishment of a proper bitcoin exchang on wall street by New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs. Personally, I share this conclusion. Eventhough it’s not exactly in line with the decentralized and unregulated original idea and core on which the crypto market’s was founded, it will absolutely simplify things for the many who simply want to be able to trade bitcoin and other crypto assets without having to register on crypto exchanges. There will always be a certain number of falling off given the uncertainty associated with the crypto market for the uninitiated. Making trading in cryptocurrencies easily accessible through well known and established institutions like New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs, people will certainly feel more comfortable and reassured and the market will surge. However, I believe that this goes against the very nature of cryptocurrencies. But that’s a whole different story. //robertVERITAS Wall Street Adopting Bitcoin Will Lead Crypto Market to Surge Brian Kelly, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, contributor to CNBC’s Fast Money, and founder of BKCM, stated on the May 9 Fast Money show that the adoption of bitcoin by Wall Street’s biggest financial institutions such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Goldman Sachs will lead the cryptocurrency market to surge in the short- to mid-term. Kelly is Shocked Earlier this week, as CCN reported , NYSE’s parent company ICE Exchange has been developing and testing a bitcoin exchange to serve investors from the traditional finance sector. Various reports revealed that ICE Exchange is not launching a futures market like CME and CBOE, rather a proper bitcoin exchange on which investors can buy, sell, and store bitcoin directly.\n“The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential,” the New York Times reported.\nKelly emphasized that while he is “shocked” the cryptocurrency market did not surge in value based on the entrance of NYSE into the market, he stated that investors have missed out on an important element, which is that like Xapo and Coinbase, NYSE and its parent company ICE Exchange will start to operate a custody solution for institutional holders.\nThe operator of the NYSE is planning to support bitcoin trading. “I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bearer instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly.\nHe further noted that the development of a bitcoin custody solution by ICE Exchange signifies cryptocurrencies have become an emerging asset class. More importantly, Kelly added that the growth of cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class will allow multi-billion dollar pensions, endowment, and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\n“Finally, it opens the door for pensions and endowments. Up to this point, it has been very difficult for them to get comfortable compliance wise in holding cryptocurrency. If ICE has a custodian solution that is SEC compliant, that’s going to open the floodgates,” Kelly added.\nWhat Will Floodgates Look Like? The cryptocurrency market has become a $0.5 trillion market with barely any capital from institutional investors, endowments, and pensions. If institutional investors begin to enter the cryptocurrency market with tens of billions of dollars in new capital, it will allow the cryptocurrency market to grow at a pace that is incomparable to its growth rate in the past. It could enable the cryptocurrency market to evolve into a multi-trillion dollar market, as many investors have expected since 2016.\nImages from Shutterstock.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T10:30:10.390+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a91f704f4d2e6955b53c0c9b3822cfe9ee282fbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVlT8m.xNywiyJI_A6v9Y1Nb0Ad.xPZ9BlKiErRwlnOaICzs3ORHp00W2ymy2K.ARynJ4CwR7k6wQVjqKqUGtQqyQeA6Pa2zycwV46vtFuPxx", "site_full": "www.dailypolitical.com", "site": "dailypolitical.com", "site_section": "http://www.dailypolitical.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "Daily Political", "title": "Bitcoin Fast 1-Day Volume Tops $1,573.00 (BCF)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Fast 1-Day Volume Tops $1,573.00 (BCF)", "published": "2018-05-11T10:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/747.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a91f704f4d2e6955b53c0c9b3822cfe9ee282fbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVlT8m.xNywiyJI_A6v9Y1Nb0Ad.xPZ9BlKiErRwlnOaICzs3ORHp00W2ymy2K.ARynJ4CwR7k6wQVjqKqUGtQqyQeA6Pa2zycwV46vtFuPxx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyrone Williams", "published": "2018-05-11T10:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Fast 1-Day Volume Tops $1,573.00 (BCF)", "text": "Tweet\nBitcoin Fast (CURRENCY:BCF) traded 16% lower against the U.S. dollar during the twenty-four hour period ending at 22:00 PM Eastern on May 10th.

Hacked Italian Bitgrail exchange is closed again after a brief reopening. It suspended operations on request from the court of Florence, following a petition  filed on behalf of one of its creditors. Also, beleaguered Romanian Btcxchange has shut down after multiple setbacks. A local bank recently closed its account.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Hacker Gets Trolled, Vertcoin Gets Hacked\nBitgrail Reopened, then Closed Again Bitgrail, the Italian crypto exchange which suspended operations after losing 17 million XRB in a presumed hack this year, has briefly reopened and closed again. On May 1 the trading platform announced it will commence operations on the following day, May 2, 2018, with trading and withdrawals available for all supported coins, except Nano (XRB). Bitgrail also promised to restore the Nano market for users at a date to be announced shortly. \"Our team is working hard on verifying all users who have submitted the documents in an expedited manner,\" the statement read.\nThe reopening, however, did not last long. Yesterday, the exchange announced it was suspending operations again after receiving a notice from the court of Florence. The court asked for the immediate closure of Bitgrail following a \"precautionary suspension request\" by lawyers representing one of the 3,000 users who suffered losses in the hack. Last week, the law firm Bonelli Erede  filed a petition on behalf of the creditor asking the court to declare the entities operating the exchange bankrupt. These are Webcoin Solutions di Francesco Firano and BG Services, formerly Bitgrail S.r.l.\nIn February, Bitgrail's owner, Francesco Firano, announced \"that internal checks revealed unauthorized transactions which led to a 17 million Nano shortfall.\" The market value of the lost cryptocurrency was estimated at around $170 million at the time. About a month later, Bitgrail stated in a Telegram post that it will refund users through the creation and issuance of BGS tokens and denied responsibility for the losses. 20 percent of the missing funds were to be returned in Nano, and 80 percent in the new BGS coin. The users who were willing to accept the offer had to restore their accounts and give up any legal claims. Almost 80 percent of the participants in a Twitter poll hosted by Francesco Firano himself voted to close the trading platform.\nRomanian Btcxchange Closing for Good Btcxchange, the oldest bitcoin trading platform in Romania, has closed down after multiple setbacks through the years. The platform informed its customers about the decision in an announcement published on its website. Btcxchange had already shut down some of its operations in February and crypto-fiat conversion was not available to its users. However, clients were allowed to deposit bitcoin and maintain their accounts. \"Please withdraw all your balances before May 1,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe Romanian crypto exchange was launched in 2014. In December of that year, its team issued its first notice asking customers to withdraw their funds. The team claimed it had been denied access to the exchange servers by their lead programmer. Btcxchange shut down its operations again in August, 2016, after it was up for sale. Services were restored in November by the new owner. The latest episode of the drama unfolded in January this year when Idea Bank closed the platform's account.\nChase Closes Erik Voorhees' Credit Card Account Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees has announced in a tweet that Chase Bank has closed his credit card account. \"Chase just closed my credit card account. No warning. No explanation of any kind. Won't tell me why,\" he said in a post on the microblogging platform.\n\"No wonder people hate that company,\" Voorhees added, correcting himself in a further comment: \"Sorry, I shouldn't have used the word 'company.' Company refers to a market-based organization that has to bring a product to market and compete openly.\" He also notes that the bank is \"more akin to a Soviet-style state-appendage that wraps itself in regulatory cronyism than a company.\"\nCoinbase Applauds New York Inquiry into Crypto Exchanges US-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase has greeted the actions recently taken by New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, in regards to crypto trading platforms. \"We applaud […] the action to bring further transparency to the virtual currency markets,\" Coinbase chief legal officer Mike Lempres wrote in a letter. The exchange, which is licensed under New York's Bitlicense regime, has published part of its response to Schneiderman's office. Lempres discloses information about the assets stored on the platform, $150 billion, and the funding it has received. The letter also notes the company's cooperation with authorities and regulators around the world.\nIn April, the Office of the Attorney General of New York sent letters to 13 crypto exchanges as part of an inquiry into policies and practices employed by the trading platforms. Not all of them have responded positively to the questionnaire. \"When I saw this 34-point demand […] I realized that we made the right decision to get the hell out of New York,\" Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell, said in a Twitter post . Mr. Powell also described acceptance of the questionnaire as \"placative kowtowing.\" His reaction has been praised by other representatives of the industry.

The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded. The tool is open source at https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org and the code can be reviewed at any time. Also, make sure you never share your private key with anyone or online. Adding funds to your cold storage wallet. The next step is you want to add bitcoin to the wallet. Just like with any other bitcoin transaction, using a wallet you may have online, scan the public cold storage wallet QR code or copy the address, and send funds to your cold storage. You can check the status of the funds at anytime using a Bitcoin block explorer. Redeeming bitcoin from cold storage.\nWhen you are ready to spend from your cold storage wallet, you will need to import the private key to a Bitcoin wallet that is online. Any wallet that supports importing private keys will work. For example, if you download the Bitcoin Unlimited wallet at https://wallet.bitcoin.com/ (which is a full Bitcoin client) you can import the private key. To do so, simply follow these steps. 1. Open the client and click on Help. 2. Select the Debug Window and click on the Console tab. 3. Type in the field “importprivkey <bitcoinprivkey>” (replace <bitcoinprivkey> with your private key and remove quotes). 4. Hit enter to import the private key; this will require a rescan of the blockchain which may take a few minutes to syncronize. In this screen, you can see the “importprivkey” command in the Console. Type “help” in the Console to get a full list of wallet commands.\nAnother alternative online web wallet that supports importing private keys is Blockchain.info at https://www.bitcoin.com/choose-your-wallet/blockchain . To import your private key on this wallet, simply follow these steps. 1. Open the online wallet. 2. Click on Settings and then click on Addresses. 3. Click on Import Address. 4. Copy and paste the cold storage private key and click Import/transfer. 5. You can safely archive the old address and transfer the funds to your wallet. Once you have successfully moved your cold storage funds online, they are ready to spend. Note: Never reuse cold storage wallets. Once you have redeemed them online, follow the process outlined above to create a new one when necessary. Want a cool place to spend your BTC?

And that’s one of their conservative estimates—although $36,000 is the Fundstrat report’s “most likely” target, Sam Doctor (one of the authors) wrote that Bitcoin could end up anywhere between $20,000 and $64,000, depending on how the financial, electricity and technology landscapes develop over the next year and a half.\nEven the lower end of that range represents a 113 percent increase from the current bitcoin price, while the more optimistic estimate represents a 583 percent increase. The reason for the report’s optimistic prediction is the steadily more cost-effective ratio between the bitcoin price and miners’ breakeven cost (P/BE).\nAs reported by CCN, this has proven to be a “reliable long-term support level” for the flagship cryptocurrency, and future mining infrastructure development will “underpin bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” “We expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple” (Fundstrat analyst, Sam Doctor). Although it is important to note that Fundstrat has always been quick to talk up Bitcoin, it is true that crypto-mining firms have been scaling up their operations following last year’s bull market (even after the crash).\nAs reported by CCN, Bitmain, the world’s dominant mining hardware manufacturer, “Is said to have made as much as $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, and Canaan — its largest competitor — is preparing to hold an initial public offering (IPO) that it believes will provide it with a $1 billion valuation.” This, combined with the news that Wall Street’s biggest financial institutions (Goldman Sachs and The New York Stock Exchange) are, as reported by The New York Times, “Working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin,” should be enough for the digital currency’s advocates to continue seeing their bank accounts through gold-tinted glasses.

With more and more advocates coming back out of the woodwork in support of Blockchain and Digital Currency, it would appear that the bulls are back to a certain extent, with the only problem being the bears are more numerous now that the futures market allows you to take a short position.\nThe stakes are high, with there being no doubt that things get very slippy when the price starts falling. For now though, a sort of eerie calm has come over Crypto markets.\nWriting for Coindesk, Omkar Godbole a technical analyst believes that the charts are telling him there is more room for the major crypto to move further to the downside after the failure near its recent high around $10,000,\n“The bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA indicates a short-term (5 days) bullish-to-bearish trend change. It also indicates the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has not run its course.” Bearish trend looms for Bitcoin\nExpanding on this bearish storyline, a clean close beneath key support would add further validation to Mr. Godbole’s view that the bull run may be over in the shorter term, as a number of important momentum indicators are now turning markedly lower and the possibility of a test of the 100-day moving average seems possible, as the analyst writes,\n“Break below $9,228 (support on the hourly chart) would add credence to the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open the doors for a drop to $8,980 and $8,868 (100-day moving average).”\nIt is not all doom and gloom as despite giving us the figure beneath which Bitcoin is likely to find its bull support removed, the next level to open up a test of recent highs is not that far away, with just a few hundred dollars needed to reignite the bull trend,\n“A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low) would confirm a bearish reversal. On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently located at $9,452) would signal the end of the pullback from the recent high of $9,990.”\nIt is therefore still a tricky time for Crypto markets, with supply and demand finely balanced the next big move could be the start of a big move.

Huawei is releasing BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet in its AppGallery app store, which will be pre-installed on all new Huawei smartphones, according to Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com. It will reportedly be the first digital currency app offered on Huawei devices. Access to apps like BTC.com’s is limited in China as the government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some parts of Apple’s App Store. While Chinese authorities shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned initial coin offerings, people can still own cryptocurrencies. De la Torre told Bloomberg: “It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.” In March, it was reported that Huawei is planning to develop a smartphone that will support decentralized applications (DApp) running on blockchain technology. Last year, Huawei shipped 90.9 mln units in the Chinese market, where it enjoys a dominant market share of 20.4 percent. Huawei’s global market share was 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement: “From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.” Last month, Huawei announced the launch of a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform focused on smart contract development, “a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security blockchain technology platform service for enterprises and developers.”\nMeanwhile, China is planning to release nationwide blockchain standards by the end of 2019.

The market leader is currently trading around $9200, but can Bitcoin ever reach and surpass its previous highs? Sure it can — here's how.\n'Better Security Infrastructure' As suggested by Forbes , the first thing which could send Bitcoin skyrocketing is increased adoption as a conventional currency — meaning as both a store of value and medium of exchange. However, for this to happen, more secure and user-friendly infrastructure must be built. Christian Ferri, President and CEO of BlockStar, explained :\nAssuming Bitcoin will be used as [a] store of value going forward (e.g. digital gold), a better security infrastructure overarching the entire crypto ecosystem will be needed for people to place trust in this new financial medium and start using it. Once this happens, more people will jump in, so a scalable infrastructure will be crucial.\nPrice Stabilization Ferri also noted to Forbes that security enhancements alone aren't enough to push Bitcoin into the mainstream as a viable currency. In order to act as legitimate tender, the price needs to be stabilized by protocol enhancements. He explained:\nIf new enhancements are done to the protocol to allow Bitcoin (or a fork of thereof) to become a medium for everyday transactions (e.g. buy your Latte with Bitcoin), we'll need a stability mechanism in place, on top of security and scalability mentioned above. This way that Latte won't cost you $5 today and $50 tomorrow.\nInstitutional Investors Thirdly, the virtual currency needs big money to come in if it ever expects to reach new highs. And by \"big money,\" we mean institutional investors . Paul A. Taylor, Executive Chairman of Fabric Foundation, told Forbes :\nThe influx of money from institutions putting money into crypto index funds will cause a cascading [effect], causing the herd to rush in.\nDarren Marble of CrowdfundX agrees, noting:\nAt this stage, institutional investors hold the key to Bitcoin's growth. Concerns around liquidity, security, counterparty risk and custody of assets have so far prevented institutional investors from buying Bitcoin on decentralized exchanges.\nRegulated Exchanges It's a well-known fact that big-money investors have begun dipping their toes in Bitcoin's waters — but for institutional investment to really come into play, regulated exchanges need to launch cryptocurrency offerings. Marble told Forbes :\nOnly when regulated exchanges — such as tZERO, Coinlist, or even NASDAQ — go live with their secondary crypto trading platforms, will the smart money begin investing directly into Bitcoin. Once this happens, the floodgates will open and we will see a new paradigm emerge; the crypto market cap will exceed $1 billion, and lead by new all-time highs of Bitcoin.\nETFs Finally, the last major thing which could push the daddy of cryptocurrency to new highs is the launching of cryptocurrency-related exchange-traded funds — otherwise known as ETFs . Chris Kline, co-founder and COO of BitcoinIRA.com, told Forbes :\nCrypto-related exchange-traded funds may allow for simpler trading through brokerage accounts, which would also contribute to hiked up prices for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The writing is on the wall; with so much momentum surrounding Bitcoin and other digital currencies, in my opinion, it's only a matter of time before prices rebound again.\nDid we miss anything?

They might be waiting for prices to recover to the level at which they invested and then they sell. When people sell in bulk, price again goes down. So we should see a lot of these fluctuations till bitcoins again reaches to $20000. Do you agree with this logic ? Click to expand... Kinda, But most people bought BTC in 15-20k ranges is already sold everything because of panic sell The rest is HODL-ERs and will wait until it surpassed 20k.

I have read a lot of it here in our forum. Thus really make sense why should we invest in bitcoin? Well i know that you can add up more when comes to the advantage of investing bitcoin from the other members as well. In fact i get a lot of idea from them from reading and reading from their post. Thus includes bitcoin as a form of savings highlights the best idea on investing bitcoin which could be later use as for emergency needs also. So how it will work? Well i have some extra money from my salary so instead of putting it to my piggy bank i will invest it here in cryptocurrency though it is not that big yet it could be consider as savings. From time to time as other members done like holding and selling it in the right time will do also. So it will be savings plus profit and that could also be use for emergency needs and easier to get or convert it to money for emergency uses unlike lending money from banks that will cater 2-3days process before you get your money. So this is the best idea i guess. How about you?Could you consider this thoughts?\nI think, It is impossible, you save in bitcoin for emergency needs. You prefer save in banks for emergency needs.

While BTC's falls have been less than other tokens over the last 48-hours, the move may signal lower prices in the short-term although the longer-term uptrend remains in place for now. The 50-day moving average at $8,280 may provide some support, along with a cluster of trades between April 13 to April 20, although a sharp break and close below may negate the recent uptrend and threaten the April 1 low at $6,438. The 200-day ma, currently at $9,374 coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $9,385 and should provide resistance in the short-term.\nBitcoin (BTC) Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (June 2017 - May 11, 2018)\nRipple Breaks Down with Further Losses Eyed\nAnother poor week for Ripple with the token falling from $0.84 to a current level of $0.675 as sellers dominate. We have discussed how the token, along with Ether, is supposedly being talked about by the SEC over whether or not it should be classified as a security - a negative outcome - and with little in the way of news flow, the bears still control price action. The February 13 swing high at $0.708 was broken easily, as was the April 25 swing low at $0.747, leaving a gap on the April 12 candle around $0.60 the next level of downside interest. To the upside, the previously mentioned $0.70 and $0.75 levels remain as short-term targets.

While BTC's falls have been less than other tokens over the last 48-hours, the move may signal lower prices in the short-term although the longer-term uptrend remains in place for now. The 50-day moving average at $8,280 may provide some support, along with a cluster of trades between April 13 to April 20, although a sharp break and close below may negate the recent uptrend and threaten the April 1 low at $6,438. The 200-day ma, currently at $9,374 coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $9,385 and should provide resistance in the short-term.\nBitcoin (BTC) Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (June 2017 - May 11, 2018)\nRipple Breaks Down with Further Losses Eyed\nAnother poor week for Ripple with the token falling from $0.84 to a current level of $0.675 as sellers dominate. We have discussed how the token, along with Ether, is supposedly being talked about by the SEC over whether or not it should be classified as a security - a negative outcome - and with little in the way of news flow, the bears still control price action. The February 13 swing high at $0.708 was broken easily, as was the April 25 swing low at $0.747, leaving a gap on the April 12 candle around $0.60 the next level of downside interest. To the upside, the previously mentioned $0.70 and $0.75 levels remain as short-term targets.

(Nasdaq: AAPL) shares and refusing to take a stand on gun control, the 87-year-old investing icon took a few shots at bitcoin, saying: “It’s probably rat poison squared.”\nAs a crypto investor , and one who believes in a better, more efficient world served by getting rid of the middleman … I’m going to (surprisingly) agree with Buffett here. Any reference to bitcoin as “rat poison” is an entirely appropriate metaphor.\nWhile rat poison might not be the best means of quenching one’s thirst, however, I don’t think that Buffett’s beverage investment, The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO), constitutes a healthier alternative.\nRat poison, on the other hand, can be extremely useful for ridding oneself of a rodent infestation. In this case, the vermin-infested governments and corporations (especially banks) that plop themselves smack in the middle of economic transactions, and then extract a Big Gulp-sized toll on societies. Bitcoin Restores Power to the People Bitcoin’s technological breakthrough allows anyone with an internet connection to buy and store something of value that’s neither tied to a state nor a bank. This allows the free market to decide what the demand (and price) should be for money, not a group of elitist, egghead economists who spectacularly fail once a decade.\nThis will be a liberating force as citizens are able to hold more of their own value and won’t be subject to the whims of a profligate government or monopolizing middleman.\nBitcoin can be a check on people in power. Citizens now have the option to swap their domestic currency for bitcoin, avoiding hyperinflation and currency debasements that threaten their purchasing power.\nVenezuela’s annual inflation rate is over 1,000%, and bitcoins are bought and sold at significant premiums as the locals ditch their worthless currency for something that can better store value.\nMost citizens simply can’t pick up and move to another country, thereby voting with their feet. And in corrupt democracies like Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe, voting is inconsequential anyway.\nHowever, the threat of millions of citizens voting with their wallets should worry dictators and autocrats from Caracas to Shanghai. A windfall of citizens moving out of their fiat currency into cryptocurrencies would be enough to spark a currency crisis and facilitate social unrest.\nThere’s a reason governments are fearful of bitcoin and have tried to suppress trading and ownership of the digital currency. When they lose control of the money, they lose control of their oppressed citizenry. The Digital Gold Rush Now, perhaps ol’ Warren simply got this one wrong. Hey, when you’ve got $84 billion in the bank, it’s hard to empathize with the little guy trying to put food on the table in faraway lands.\nMaybe he didn’t understand how investments in the new “internet of value” actually work. As he recently told Yahoo Finance: If you buy something like a farm, an apartment house or an interest in a business … you can do that on a private basis … and it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more. Buffett continued : You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble, somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow . That’s one kind of game. That is not investing. First things first. I agree with the Oracle here that the crypto asset class is entirely speculative.\nMost of the 1,500-plus cryptocurrencies have no real-world product, and therefore no utility value. Many of them likely won’t even launch anything, and they’ll end up burning their investors.\nAs I’ve written before, there’s a digital gold rush happening here, and it’s attracting entrepreneurs with great ideas and charlatans with not-so-great ideas. As the world becomes digitally connected, we will need economies of scale to manage these new networks and provision digital and real-world resources.\nThis is par for the course. Most, if not all, early-stage investments are extremely speculative and difficult to value.\nIt’s the difference between buying a fully furnished home in a well-developed neighborhood and buying a piece of land in the middle of the woods. The raw land might have more upside if the surrounding area is developed, but there’s no guarantee you’ll get your money back.\nCrypto just happens to be the hottest piece of raw property on the market, and people are paying excessive premiums to get a piece .\nEarly-stage investments are notorious for either returning upward of 1,000% or zero. That’s why early-stage investors own large, diversified portfolios of very small bets. If they lose on 90% on them but hit a few home runs, they can still outperform the indexes.\nReality (and gravity) will drag most of these crypto assets down to $0. But some will deliver products that change the world. Keep More of Your Hard-Earned Wealth Bitcoin obviates the need for a bank or government to create and store money, and this is only the first iteration in the crypto space.\nProjects like Ethereum and EOS are building the necessary infrastructure to power smart contracts, a method to exchange anything of value in a transparent way without the need for a middleman. Think about renting someone’s house without Airbnb or calling a taxi without needing Uber.\nOld valuation techniques can’t be applied to these new crypto assets. Discount cash-flow analysis is a futile endeavor. There are no companies here, just open-source software protocols. (Protocol is a fancy way of saying “way of doing things.”)\nThe value of a crypto asset relates to the demand for the digitally linked network. The tokens represent a fee for accessing the network, or a fuel to power a smart contract.\nImagine if you were charged a small fee, represented by an “email token,” to send an email. As more people move from the spying eyes of Google’s Gmail, the value of this token would increase in price.\nAdditionally, since crypto tokens facilitate economic transactions without the need for a middleman, they will allow those who provide value to keep more of their hard-earned wealth.\nIf there’s anything the world could use right now, it’s for workers to keep more of the fruits of their labor.\nI’m sure that’s something Warren Buffett would definitely agree with me on.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "berkshire hat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "designerkottayam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:29:06.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5442075633a1f81df03815675882e3e46668332", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Ykjv4r4e1immenIWb7DS_uXDfn2WoHku0kGu5dqpzigZUvKWihbBBVowFScmoraTMFDToT81Q203r1U0cZA8iGW8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Just implemented decentralized live video streaming over Bitcoin Cash + WebTorrent, powered by Memo.cash and Blockpress protocol.

Precious Lanay Fitzgerald and Lawillie Joshua Hall, the man and woman known as the \"Discount Bitcoin Bandits,\" each face multiple charges after they are accused of stealing approximately $90,000 in a fraudulent Bitcoin scheme.\nAccording to a report released by the LA District Attorney's Office, the pair allegedly posted advertisements online offering Bitcoin for sale and took advantage of potential buyers. They used these adverts and online communications to steal money from six people between October and February of last year.\nIn one instance, Fitzgerald was supposed to send the cryptocurrency to a victim after receiving a wire transfer but failed to do so. In the instances where Fitzgerald met face-to-face with victims, she is alleged to have forcefully taken the cash brought to purchase bitcoins.\nHall has been labeled as an accomplice and is accused of helping Fitzgerald with two of the robberies, reportedly using a handgun. Furthermore, an infant was supposedly present during the robberies which only adds to the pair's legal woes.\nThis is not the first time someone has been robbed while trying to purchase cryptocurrency. Amid other reported robberies earlier this year, stories surfaced of thieves breaking into the home of a cryptocurrency trader in England and holding the investor and his family at gunpoint, demanding he transfer his bitcoins to them.\nHard Fork or Hard Time? Fitzgerald was initially charged with four counts of second-degree robbery, two counts of child abuse, and one count of grand theft on March 19th. On top of those felonies, two new charges were filed on April 25th: an additional felony charge of child abuse and grand theft.\nHall was also charged on March 19th with two counts of second-degree robbery.\nBoth defendants face gun allegations, and charges against Fitzgerald include her prior convictions. These convictions reference a case in 2010 where Fitzgerald was charged with assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm.\nThe two are expected to be re-arraigned on the amended complaints during their preliminary hearing. Prosecutors are suggesting Fitzgerald's bail be set at $570,000 and Hall's to be set at $200,000.\nIf convicted, Fitzgerald faces a maximum possible sentence of 29 years and 18 months, while Hall faces up to 19 years and 4 months in prison if convicted on all charges.\nAs always, it should be stressed to do some due diligence if you're looking to buy or sell Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for cash.

With a rate of around $9,000 per US dollar, Bitcoin has become a highly valuable asset. Furthermore, Bitcoin is also a great financial transaction since it offers anonymity, privacy and lower cost of the transaction, something traditional currency and financial institutions cannot offer.

Its main goal is to introduce the easiest and safest way to purchase and use Bitcoin so that everybody can invest in this digital currency.
