I just updated the firmware and it was a fucking nightmare.\nPart of the way through the update process it got stuck. The ledger showed the word bootloader and clicking the buttons did nothing. The wallet software just said to plug it in. No options, nothing worked.\nTurns out lots of people have this problem. Their support page says that for those of us running windows 7, we will have to finish the update on another machine. One not running win7.\nI do not have a non-win7 machine and there is no way I am downgrading to win10. Nor do I want to spend money on a new machine even if that was an option.\nSo that's the situation. The update was mandatory so no way to avoid it, and it didn't complete. My coins were stuck.\nI eventually found a developer version of the ledger manager software on github, ran it and the update went through and things worked normally again. But that was pure dumb luck, could easily have been locked out of my money for months.\nGet a trezor instead. Updated the firmware on that too and it went through in seconds with no issues. Thinking about dropping the ledger and getting an extra trezor instead. Or maybe an entirely different brand would be in order.\nAll of your points seem valid, except your assertion that you \"could easily have been locked out of my money for months.\" First, you should always have your back-up seed before you do any upgrade, and you can put your back up seed into almost any wallet and get access to your funds. Only a rookie would not safeguard his backup key, especially when most wallets also prompt you to save your backup key.\nAnd they will quickly get a fix out. Sheesh, delete computers because bug.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []},

London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin", "text": "Joomla Social LONDON - Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said. Egypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision. “Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active. -

The hackers \" made deposits at cryptocurrency exchanges, traded the coins for BTC or another coin, and then withdrew the funds. Next, the attacker used their dominant computing power to force the rest of the network to accept falsified blocks that reversed their initial deposits and caused these funds to vanish from exchange-controlled wallets \", reports CCN .\nUp to $18 million could've been stolen as the attacker sent themselves over 380,000 BTG but there's no word on how many of these transactions were successful. If they were, up to $18 million is gone. The blame? Equihash, the mining algorithm behind BTG. BTG developers blamed, at least in part, Equihash; which is used with numerous cryptocurrencies.\nBTG director of communications Edward Iskra warned people on May 18, where he said a malicious miner was using the exploit to swipe funds from crypto exchanges. BTG ranks as the 26th-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $752 million and priced at the time of writing at $44.\nThis isn't the first big heist of cryptocurrencies in the last week or so, with XVG hit with up to $1.75 million taken during another mining attack.

Written by: Published on: May/28/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from North Carolina will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL NORTH CAROLINA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nThere are laws on the books that would need to be repealed or amended before sports betting could take place here.\nThis is also a conservative state that doesn't look too kindly on gambling. State legislators are not exactly rushing to push for regulation.\nThe state does have a lottery and a casino on Cherokee land. That's about it.\n“Our gambling statutes go back to 1891,” said Jeff Welty, an associate professor at the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Government. “We’ve got a pretty long uninterrupted history of not allowing gambling, but the world’s changing. That history can be set aside if the General Assembly chooses to do so.”\nNeedless-to-say, North Carolina gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:41:49.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7636864eb946337c9989c36c9d3f43247a901b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vx1Q68xoWrxXLIxiIcfgx8oEPnzKaaZzTAb5jj7P0hcP_qNx4f.FAi0U_e6c_f4GJr2HhLls9dY0A--", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Trading Down 14.7% Over Last Week", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Trading Down 14.7% Over Last Week", "published": "2018-05-29T04:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7636864eb946337c9989c36c9d3f43247a901b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vx1Q68xoWrxXLIxiIcfgx8oEPnzKaaZzTAb5jj7P0hcP_qNx4f.FAi0U_e6c_f4GJr2HhLls9dY0A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rob Logan", "published": "2018-05-29T04:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Trading Down 14.7% Over Last Week", "text": "Posted by Rob Logan on May 28th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin (CURRENCY:BTC) traded down 3.1% against the U.S. dollar during the 1 day period ending at 21:00 PM Eastern on May 28th.

Bitcoin’s official message board is bitcointalk.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be bought or sold on these cryptocurrency exchanges: Binance, Lbank, Iquant, IDAX, Bitinka, itBit, Omicrex, BitBay, Sistemkoin, Coinroom, BitMEX, Neraex, Huobi, Kraken, LakeBTC, Bit-Z, Coinsuper, Coinone, BTCBOX, Cobinhood, YoBit, CoinEgg, Negocie Coins, Poloniex, fex, xBTCe, Fisco, Tidex, GOPAX, bitFlyer, Livecoin, CoinsBank, Simex, Ethfinex, BitForex, Quoine, OEX, B2BX, TOPBTC, Coinrail, HitBTC, Trade By Trade, Bithumb, Gemini, Coinhub, DragonEX, Bibox, GDAX, Bitbank, CoinTiger, WEX, Exrates, CEX.IO, Bitfinex, Exmo, Zaif, Luno, OKEx, Gate.io, OOOBTC, EXX, RightBTC, Upbit, Bittrex, Kucoin, Paribu, BCEX, Bitstamp, Octaex, Korbit, BTCC, OTCBTC, CoinBene, ZB.COM, BtcTrade.im, Hotbit, Fatbtc, C2CX and CoinEx Market.

The long-term outlook shows shifting momentum in favor of bears that could see a large decline toward the 2018 low and even new lows for the year. The Weekly Outlook for Bitcoin\nThe weekly chart for BTC-USD on the Bitstamp exchange, shown below, gives two clear bearish signals for bitcoin for the week beginning May 28.\nOn May 28, we saw the price action move below the previous week’s low at $7,213.09, triggering the bearish saucer signal on the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Also, we see the lagging line (purple) moves below the previous price action, for the first time since spring 2015.\nFirstly, there is large significance to the bearish saucer signal in the author’s opinion, as on the weekly timeframe, opportunities like this are not found very often, e.g., in 2017, we had four bullish saucer signals on the weekly chart (zero bearish saucer). The difference between the two is the sign of the AO (positive or negative).\nFor the week beginning May 28, the AO is at -1196.93, breaking below the oscillator’s previous red crest from late April. 2014-2018 Fractal\nThe last time the bearish saucer signal was triggered for bitcoin on the weekly chart was during 2014. In fact, there were three occurrences.\nThe first bearish saucer was like the current situation presented above; the markets are suggested to be in equilibrium (inside the Ichimoku cloud) and the bearish saucer signal is triggered, with a large downward move follows due to the strengthening momentum.\nThe chart above shows the price for bitcoin between late 2013 and early 2015. We see that the first bearish saucer was triggered late July 2014, with BTC-USD moving below $595.51. The bearish saucer signal was triggered twice more, with both giving profitable moves into the downward trend, and before bitcoin eventually bottomed out at $152.40.\nOf course, the future is not always like the past, but these situations are too similar from a technical standpoint, ignoring fundamentals, they are the same trade. Sure, fundamentals are much stronger today, but the price and market structure are telling us that further downside is needed. Hence, the AO signal is an early warning that the bitcoin price may be suppressed further.\nTraders should monitor the color and magnitude of the AO; if it remains red and continues to go deeper into negative territory, any short positions should not be closed, while if the AO changes color and/or starts to move higher, we may want to consider closing short positions.\nTherefore, bitcoin is at a critical junction, either the cloud holds as support or it breaks through, marking the beginning of a long-term downtrend and echoing the price action following the previous run up, which saw bitcoin shoot up over $1,100 to eventually bottom out around the mid-$100’s. Advertisement advertisement Lagging Line Confirms Downtrend, Watch for Cloud Breakout Next\nSecondly, we see that the lagging line (purple) of the Ichimoku indicator gave a bearish signal on the close of the session ending May 27. The lagging line has moved below the price action 26 periods back, suggesting a downward trend is just now being confirmed.\nThe week ending May 27 also saw the market close below the conversion line (blue), giving another sell signal. Finally, the Ichimoku can glean some more information about the likelihood of the BTC-USD exchange rate reaching certain levels. For instance, we see that the current price action is now contained within the Ichimoku cloud.\nThe weekly chart below shows that the lower span of the cloud lies at $6,271.50, so we should anticipate support around this level. The purple box shows a strong support zone aligned with the lower span of the cloud and the fractal support from late March 2018 ($6,427.16).\nA weekly close above the upper span of the cloud, i.e., above $7391.99, could be a possible bullish scenario, but a slow drift toward $10,000 is probably more likely, after a period of further down/consolidation. As the chart below shows, the Ichimoku cloud suggests long-term equilibrium around or above $10,000 for the rest of 2018.\nOther important supports to keep in mind over the long-term are $5,920.72 (fractal low) and $5,870.03 (open of bullish Marubozu variant, Nov. 13, ‘17.)\nThe ‘record session’ count is also show on the weekly charts. Bitcoin posted a fresh high during the week of April 30 just under $10,000. However, three weeks passed with no test or breach of that high, so the count has turned in to a ‘record low’ count, instead of a ‘record high’ count, with bears swiftly taking the upper hand, with the current week the fourth ‘record low’ or near consecutive lower low.\nRemember, after seven to ten record sessions, bulls/bears are very likely to be exhausted and we can look for a major change in trend.\nWith the fourth record low in play, we could see a prolonged period of selling pressure until the week of June 18, 2018, at the earliest, using the record session count. At latest, September 29, 2018. However, if we observe three weeks in a row without a new low, the count is restarted and a chance for a bullish redemption may present itself. Short-term Outlook\nOver the short term, important supports lie at $7,000 then $6,834.1,7, which is the open of the bullish Marubozu variant from mid-April shown by the 4-hour chart below.\nA sustained break over $7,213.09 would be considered slightly bullish, with a possible resistance just under $8,000, as indicated by the upper span of the red cloud.\nDisclaimer: The author hodls some bitcoin and a leveraged short position was taken near the trigger point of the bearish saucer described above on May 28. This article should not be taken as investment advice, and readers should always do their own research. Only risk what you can afford to lose, if and when, you choose to trade the markets.

Since then, the price has dramatically dropped to a level near $7200. Even with the large swings and huge drop in price, it has not deterred certain individuals from mining Bitcoin and expanding their operations.\nBitcoin Mining\nIf you’re not familiar with Bitcoin mining , it involves using ASIC miners — devices with high processing power — to complete transactions on the blockchain and get rewarded with Bitcoins for doing so. While this takes a large amount of electricity to operate, it’s lucrative for individuals who buy the equipment and use the machines.\nOpportunity For Some Cities\nOne of the challenges of running ASIC miners is the cost of electricity. However, this has created an opportunity for certain areas around the world that have the ability to supply cheap power. Bitcoin mining farms are seeking out places where they can get electricity at low prices. One of those areas is located near Massena, New York, which is powered by a hydroelectric facility. Digital Skynet Limited, a company based in Hong Kong, has set up a large number of ASIC miners in a converted factory that’s located on the outer edge of the city.\nIn the past, Alcoa had a plant in the city that provided jobs for many people. When they downsized and moved out, the jobs went with it. Some individuals think that cryptocurrency mining may provide work when they move in so small cities like Massena have been embracing the mining technology.\nOther areas around the United States have also seen an influx of Bitcoin mining farms. Cheap power fueled by the Columbia River in Washington state drew the attention of crypto miners. They set up their farms in East Wenatchee and created a gold rush type of atmosphere.\nWill It Last?\nOne of the senators from New York state who represents Massena isn’t so sure of the longevity of the mining boom. Joe Griffo has questioned how long the jobs may last and the justification for using so much electricity. These questions are difficult to answer as the parameters of Bitcoin mining constantly change when new machines are developed or the price fluctuates.\nHowever, for now, the city of Massena is pushing forward and hoping that this first phase blooms into something bigger. Tina Barksdale, a representative from digital Skynet Limited, believes that Massena , New York can transform from a small area where cryptocurrency is mined into a ‘Silicon Valley ‘type destination where people who are interested in cryptocurrency come.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.npr.org/2018/05/28/609790069/cryptocurrency-miners-make-big-promises-in-small-towns"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:46:28.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38ee5dfd4c2f8c6c5b8e0c6d096941582657ff2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQZX6WOAG9h1MTaxKm6yoeg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=9.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-topic", "title": "Are you buying bitcoins?

unforked chain,\" one response reads.\nA Tellingly Quiet Disagreement? Meanwhile, a similar report on the lack of consensus in Bitcoin Cash post-fork focused on the lack of publicity it received.\nBitcoin core developer Kalle Alm noted that 16-17% of nodes were not following the new chain May 16, adding \"everyone would explode\" if a similar phenomenon occurred on the Bitcoin network, whose nodes are running at 100 percent with the consensus rules.\n\"You can tell BCH is not bitcoin by looking at how not everyone is losing their shit all over the place,\" he wrote.\nImagine if 20% of BTC nodes failed consensus? Everyone would explode. And there would be forks as miners are not just one dude running a farm.\nBitcoinVPC creator grubles had gone further, describing the hard fork as \"an epic screw up for a network marketed as a store of value and a medium of exchange.\"\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin Cash nodes' inability to form consensus?

That fine line between obsession and irrational exuberance is probably best exemplified in wild price fluxuations, furious buying and selling. At least one historic county in Scotland, Peeblesshire (Siorrachd nam Pùballan), believes they’ve identified bitcoin addicts, and are beginning to treat them in the same manner as those with similar attractions to gambling.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt\nCastle Craig Hospital Bitcoin Addicts are a Thing in Scotland Crypto addicts could do worse, and that’s for sure: Scotland’s Castle Craig Hospital addiction treatment center is a bucolic, sprawling campus seemingly designed to induce calm and reflection. It’s also home to a first of sorts, according to regional press: a concentrated program set to dealing with a growing phenomenon, cryptocurrency addiction.\nThe hospital’s creative writing coordinator and gambling therapist, Christopher Burn, explains how the “high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nChristopher Burn Mr. Burn can be temporarily excused from jumping his lane into speculative finance; a good guess is literally no one seeks him out for economic analysis. But the rest of his point can be valid in the sense of popular anecdotes. At what time in the journey from regular, functional adult to 21 year old Canadian living in a car to save money in order to buy lesser-known crypto, … is it an addiction? What if the example does not involve a ballsy single dude; instead, it’s a family of five with three children, parents in their late 30s, who’ve sold their house in hope of riding the-then booming bitcoin core (BTC) price? Are these examples of addiction or are they simply badass pioneers who know something the rest of us do not?\nIs Crypto Just Gambling in Disguise? Tony Marini Tony Marini, on site therapist, and someone who has also struggled with cocaine and gambling addictions himself, details, “Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.”\nA recurring word, “escape,” permeates both explanations, still admittedly fuzzy in the way of a solid definition. Nevertheless it does seem if crypto occupies too great (?) a space in a person’s mind, to a point where they chronically ignore real, ongoing life around them, they just might have a problem. And since speculative markets very often evidence fast fortunes gained and lost, and gained and lost again, there must be properties of problem behavior similar to gambling addictions (which have been well-documented).\nExperienced in treating addictions such as traditional alcohol and drug problems, Castle Craig Hospital has begun addressing addictions involving cryptocurrency. Indeed, they’re using techniques in the course developed from successful gambling addiction methods. Though more than ten million people worldwide are said to be trading and dealing in cryptocurrency, no firm numbers or percentages exist regarding the amount of people with addictive symptoms.\nDo you think crypto addiction exists?

The weekend saw bitcoin's price decline well down below the $8,000 level as reported in a recent Digital Journal article. An article by CoinDesk earlier today claims that although the odds seem still to be stacked in favor of those with a bearish outlook, technical charts are showing a certain level of indecision. The CoinDesk analysis The article notes that bitcoin fell to a 6.5 week low at $7,142 earlier today. It also breached the 50-week moving average(MA) for the first time since back in 2015. Amid the continued drop in prices the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday. This may indicate that the bears may be running out of steam. A short-term rally could happen. A doji candlestick forms when the open and close numbers are virtually the same. To many analysts the doji candle signals a reversal is coming. However, the Investopedia notes:\" Some analysts interpret this as a sign of reversal. However, it may also be a time when buyers or sellers are gaining momentum for a continuation trend. Doji are commonly seen in periods of consolidation and can help analysts identify potential price breakouts.\" The 4-hour chart shows the bearish pattern continuing with the sell-off from last Monday's high of $8,644 resuming and opening the way for a decline down to $6,800. There are other signs too of a further drop in prices. In the daily chart, the both the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are declining a short-term sign favoring the bears. A series of lower lows and lower highs also is a negative sign. The relative strength index is holding a bit above 30 indicating there is room for a further drop of 200 dollars in the bitcoin(BTC) price. The weekly chart shows the price closed below the 50-week MA and validates the view that the long-term bull market is at an end. The RSI is also moving in favor of the bears. The 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA another bearish sign. However, the doji candle the other day indicates there could be a short rally if the price has a gain for the day. However, at the close today the bitcoin price was down over two hundred dollars from its open so there was no price gain. CoinDesk's outlook CoinDesk's analysis concludes: BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425. An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800–$8,000. Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal. The present situation The price of bitcoin at the open today was $7,344.997. During the day the price declined almost to the $7,000 dollar level reaching $7,080. 28. The high was $7,431.44. At the close, the price was $105.67 not far off the low. The price managed to stay above the $7,000 level all day. About half an hour into May 29 the price had risen slightly to $7,124.67 a slight uptick from the open. The present price of bitcoin can be found here. The short term bullish trend has not been confirmed.

Written by: Published on: May/28/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from South Carolina will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. Other funding methods are available as well. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL SOUTH CAROLINA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, we would say South Carolina's chances of offering sports betting options from the state where you can walk into an establishment and actually place a wager are about a 4. The only reason we're are giving it that high a number is because this is a state full of rabid College Football bettors (a la the Gamecocks and Clemson Tigers).\nSouth Carolina currently does not offer any gambling options such as casinos or horse racing tracks.\nBut Democrats in the state legislature are pushing for legalized sports betting, so it could happen should Republicans come on board.\nThat won't happen any time soon.\nIn South Carolina, the likelihood of passing any gambling bill is plain out of luck, said state Rep. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews.\n\"Realistically speaking, it’s an election year. In a majority-Republican body, the chances of a legitimate shot at it this year are not very high. What I’m hoping is to continue to be able to talk about it,\" Ott said.\nNeedless-to-say, South Carolina gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:41:56.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e269e7a1efe11fab7d2a54b1a918e00240e944cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGnL2xeCgeEDKp5mDw8sl5yzt5KgIm_VGrXz3D9X4rWfBL77r3ZuSTo_X_xgwryCO0BicyeZ9DXtsZUQrpeabF5fuX.yH_zUGlg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Thank YOU Roger Ver for pumping Bitcoin Core Coin!

Sponsored Links\nDespite many crypto-friendly policy and investment decisions around the world, such as plans by a Frankfurt stock exchange to launch bitcoin trading, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)’s launch of bitcoin futures trading, London has primarily chosen to keep its distance from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but why? London’s Crypto Criticisms\nA globally recognized basket of currencies which have experienced dizzying rises and sharp drops in a relatively short period would seem to be a subject of keen financial interest to London’s financial establishments, but many factors have conspired to hold back the City’s interest. Speaking to FT recently, FIGC Market Standards Board chairman, Mark Yallop dismissed cryptocurrencies market for its lack of scale. He said, “Their overall size, even in aggregate, is so small that they are too small to be of relevance in wholesale markets.”\nIn keeping with this picture, the entire city seems to have adopted a wait-and-see strategy for the future of crypto, viewing it as too much risk for too little available reward with little or no solid underpinning to provide a measure of assurance.\nThis particular investment mindset looks to be one that can only change if bitcoin or one of its many competitors can achieve mainstream public adoption. As it stands, illustrated in the graph below, this may be quite some way off happening. Bitcoin Transactions. Source: Blockchain.info\nSpeaking further, Yallop said, “UK market participants have been very cautious in engaging with them (cryptocurrencies) because of fears about their vulnerability to fraud, financial crime and other ‘conduct’ risk categories.”\nDue in part to bitcoin‘s pseudo-anonymous nature and its reputation for potentially enabling private transactions, London’s forex traders have been very reluctant to enter the cryptocurrency trading market. There is a partially justified fear of in some way allowing illegal money movements or otherwise getting mixed up in illicit transactions involving everyone from Russian mafia organizations to bad state actors.\nOf course, this does not mean that nobody in London trades crypto. Spread betting firms like Plus500 and IG Index enable cryptocurrency derivatives, but the catch is that market movement that users track for investment decisions are driven primarily by centers in Asia, principally China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. In the capital of global currency trading, one very significant category of forex trading is at the mercy of Asian market forces. “Unusually Strict Regulation”\nSelf-regulation is only half of the story of why London is slow to warm up to crypto. The other half of the story is that government and banking institutions involved in London’s finance have very restrictive policies regarding cryptocurrency trading. As mentioned earlier, financial centers in Germany and the US are making headway toward mainstreaming cryptocurrencies, while Tokyo on its part enables the ecosystem by regulating crypto exchanges.\nIn London however, the story is very different. Speaking to FT, Max Boonen, formerly of Goldman Sachs, now CEO of B2c2 had this to say, “Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto. It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks had issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.”\nUK authorities and banking institutions tend to look at bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a sense of suspicion and a general lack of clear direction about how exactly to go about regulating it. The ongoing disruption of strategic coordination with Europe caused by Brexit negotiations probably does not help in creating a reliable and workable plan for cryptocurrency trading regulation in the UK.\nThe good news is that London may be waking up from this self-induced crypto summer. Speaking in March 2018, Bank of England governor Mark Carney indicated that future regulation of cryptocurrency would hold crypto exchanges to the same standards used by securities and equity trading. In his view, would address a critical loophole in present laws. To this end, a joint team of officials from the Treasury, BoE and the FCA is set to collaborate later this year on a document that lays out a blueprint for the financial industry to trade cryptocurrency assets safely and legally. Future Opportunities\nAccording to Oliver Robinson, a director of Markets Regulation at AIMA, London stands to offer a unique set of opportunities if Digital Assets trading is fully normalized in the UK. In his opinion, the same advantages provided by the City in conventional trading – a central time zone, a stable legal system and a skilled talent pool – will play a significant role in bringing London to the forefront of crypto asset trading.\nTabb Group analyst, Monica Summerville goes further. In her opinion, if London’s banks decide to engage with the cryptocurrency trading market, it would set off a chain reaction that would take the entire industry to a new level. She says, “There is a wall of institutional money just waiting for the right conditions — such as adequate technology and regulatory clarity — to enter the market’’.\nOnce London’s financial establishment makes a move into crypto, and institutional investors follow suit, the probability is that the City will become Europe’s undisputed center for digital asset trading, and will mount a challenge to Asia to become the global cryptocurrency center. However, this remains a considerable ask because according to the BoE in a statement to the UK Parliament on May 24, “There [is] little appetite on the part of banks to take direct exposure to the crypto-asset market in any significant way in the medium term.” Category: Altcoins, Bitcoin, Blockchain, Business, Finance, News, Regulation, Tech Tags: bitcoin, blockchain, business, business news, cryptocurrency, finance, Finance News, fintech, FinTech News, London, regulation, technology", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T05:49:50.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef353b8684d87f5e1793bc8704713a2f11dae2ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOie9uMaDW_jvwP1yE9C_ZQCKQ.A.ECxN1kqaTqWBIg1qAhFXrzQeOgcMAjMIy92WFukmmv16Sn4i0kvb0GJyWL3rltCLUXz644A--", "site_full": "www.freelancer.ie", "site": "freelancer.ie", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.ie/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Fork Chromium open code to build a Bitcoin Mining Browser", "title_full": "Fork Chromium open code to build a Bitcoin Mining Browser", "published": "2018-05-29T03:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef353b8684d87f5e1793bc8704713a2f11dae2ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOie9uMaDW_jvwP1yE9C_ZQCKQ.A.ECxN1kqaTqWBIg1qAhFXrzQeOgcMAjMIy92WFukmmv16Sn4i0kvb0GJyWL3rltCLUXz644A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T03:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fork Chromium open code to build a Bitcoin Mining Browser", "text": "Fork Chromium open code to build a Bitcoin Mining Browser\nNote - This is a long-term project and won't start until I get back from vacation.\n1.

That fine line between obsession and irrational exuberance is probably best exemplified in wild price fluxuations, furious buying and selling. At least one historic county in Scotland, Peeblesshire (Siorrachd nam Pùballan), believes they've identified bitcoin addicts, and are beginning to treat them in the same manner as those with similar attractions to gambling.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt\nCastle Craig Hospital Bitcoin Addicts are a Thing in Scotland Crypto addicts could do worse, and that's for sure: Scotland's Castle Craig Hospital addiction treatment center is a bucolic, sprawling campus seemingly designed to induce calm and reflection. It's also home to a first of sorts, according to regional press: a concentrated program set to dealing with a growing phenomenon, cryptocurrency addiction.\nThe hospital's creative writing coordinator and gambling therapist, Christopher Burn, explains how the \"high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nChristopher Burn Mr. Burn can be temporarily excused from jumping his lane into speculative finance; a good guess is literally no one seeks him out for economic analysis. But the rest of his point can be valid in the sense of popular anecdotes. At what time in the journey from regular, functional adult to 21 year old Canadian living in a car to save money in order to buy lesser-known crypto is it an addiction? What if the example does not involve a ballsy single dude; instead, it's a family of five with three children, parents in their late 30s, who've sold their house in hope of riding the-then booming bitcoin core (BTC) price? Are these examples of addiction or are they simply badass pioneers who know something the rest of us do not?\nIs Crypto Just Gambling in Disguise? Tony Marini Tony Marini, on site therapist, and someone who has also struggled with cocaine and gambling addictions himself, details , \"Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\"\nA recurring word, \"escape,\" permeates both explanations, still admittedly fuzzy in the way of a solid definition. Nevertheless it does seem if crypto occupies too great (?) a space in a person's mind, to a point where they chronically ignore real, ongoing life around them, they just might have a problem. And since speculative markets very often evidence fast fortunes gained and lost, and gained and lost again, there must be properties of problem behavior similar to gambling addictions (which have been well-documented).\nExperienced in treating addictions such as traditional alcohol and drug problems, Castle Craig Hospital has begun addressing addictions involving cryptocurrency. Indeed, they're using techniques in the course developed from successful gambling addiction methods. Though more than ten million people worldwide are said to be trading and dealing in cryptocurrency, no firm numbers or percentages exist regarding the amount of people with addictive symptoms.\nDo you think crypto addiction exists?

London mosque now accepts bitcoin by 0\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome.\nThe mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity.\nFrom the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said. Egypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency.

This is believed to include its speed in confirmations for deposits and withdrawals, security, liquidity and access to users globally.\nAs for the launch, only the mentioned coins above will be supported for the time being, as well as every trading pair possible. Since it will be newly released, users will be able to take advantage of the “ zero trading fees ” for the first three months of the BTCC exchange release.\nAccording to the BTCC team, the platform supposedly aims to target concerns that several other exchanges continue to face. In their statement, they suggest that the platform,\n“In terms of technical developments, our exchange will utilize a multi-tier, multi-clustered system with an optimized, high-speed memory trading engine .” They went on to state the importance of security has gone up, as several hacks in 2018, proved that loopholes still exist.\nBTCC, which was once known as BTC China, was the first-ever crypto exchange to exist as it took for some time in 2011. Unfortunately, due to China’s regulations, their services were put on hold on September 30, 2017. Instead of ceasing operations, the firm made a country change and based its services in Hong Kong and London.\nToday, BTCC is Hong Kong-based and to see that the exchange will be back in action is great news. However, this could mean that the team involved has a lot of catching up to as other exchanges already support a wide range of coins.\nThe Founder and CEO of BTCC, Bobby Lee, has expressed extreme excitement and is confident that “this gives BTCC to move faster and aggressively grow out businesses in 2018 and beyond.” Will BTCC’s re-entry have users onboard its exchange?

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

The local company General Bytes, that is also one of the largest Bitcoin ATM manufacturers in the world, has been in charge of the installation of the ATMs. Prague’s Bitcoin Metro System\nPrague has one of the most important metro systems in Europe and the 5th busiest in the continent, transporting over 1.6 million passengers a day. With the new ATMs several individuals will be able to have access to the crypto market. People traveling in the metro that want to gain some exposure to cryptocurrencies will now be able to buy these digital assets.\nThe information has been revealed by the Czech firm, General Bytes which is one of the most important cryptocurrency-related companies in the country. The machines will be located in 10 of the most important metro stations in the city: Mustek, Nádrazí Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černy Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádrazi.\nSome of these metro stations are located in very touristic places, something that could be very promising for the crypto community in the city. At the moment, there are several places and shops that accept virtual currencies, including a Coffee Shop that accepts only BTC; and the Crypto Anarchy Institute known as Paralelní Polis.\nIt is important to mark that General Bytes has an important share of the worldwide Bitcoin ATM market. At the moment, it has installed 861 crypto ATM’s in different countries, and in the future this number is expected to keep increasing.\nThe Czech Republic is one of the countries with the highest number of crypto ATMs installed in the world. At the moment there are 46 locations with Bitcoin ATMs and is the 7th country after the United States (1965 locations), Canada (532 locations), Austria (177 locations), United Kingdom (134 locations), Spain (55 locations) and Russia (49 locations). The Czech Republic Moves Towards Cryptocurrencies\nThe installment of 10 new ATMs in the Metro is just one of the latest events related to virtual currencies in the European country. Some days ago, an important Czech utility company, known as Pražská Plynárenská started to accept cryptocurrency payments for its services. The company is one of the major suppliers of natural gas in the country, and is engaged in other commercial activities.\nPavel Janeček, Chief Executive Officer of Pražská Plynárenská, said about it:\n“In June we are opening a payment gateway, which will automatically transfer our bitcoin payments into regular currency, so that we don’t have to speculate with cryptocurrency. But if anyone wants to pay in an alternative way, we want to allow them to do that.”\nAt the same time, the important retailer in Czechia, Alza.cz, accepts Bitcoin payments and since the beginning of this year, it decided to accept Litecoin (LTC) payments.\nThere are many other smaller places in Prague that are working with virtual currencies and involved in the market. Moreover, the community is very active and there are crypto-related meetings in the city very often.

There is a crucial bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $7,000 handle to avoid further losses in the near term.\nBitcoin price is under a strong selling pressure below $7,300 against the US Dollar. Let’s see if BTC/USD can hold the $7,000 support level or not.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nThere was no major upside recovery above $7,350 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair corrected higher a few points yesterday, but buyers failed to push the price above the $7,350 and $7,400 resistance levels. As a result, there was a downside reaction and the price broke the last swing low of $7,150. It traded close to the $7,000 level and a low was formed at $7,048.\nAt the moment, the price is consolidating losses above the $7,000 and it remains at a risk of more losses. An initial hurdle for buyers is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,445 high to $7,048 low. However, the most significant resistance is close to $7,250, which was a support earlier.
