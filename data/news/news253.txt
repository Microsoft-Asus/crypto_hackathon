The 55-year-old Argentinian stated he believes cryptocurrency will be important in the future, but not in its current form. Pinto Thinks Cryptocurrency Tech Is Important but Not in Its Current Form\nDuring an exclusive interview conducted by CNBC at his Park Avenue headquarters that was published earlier today, Daniel Pinto of JPMorgan Chase addressed the subject of cryptocurrencies amongst others. Whilst the high-ranking executive offered more thoughts than the outright dismissal of his CEO Jamie Dimon , they were not necessarily bullish for existing cryptos.\nPinto first confirmed that JPMorgan Chase were indeed ‘looking into’ the cryptocurrency space. He went on to state that the technology will be important in the future. However, when he addressed Bitcoin, he was less optimistic:\n“… you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities.”\nPinto continued and stated that he felt that Bitcoin will have a ‘very short life.’ For him, either people would cease to believe in the ideals of censorship resistance and decentralisation that the number one cryptocurrency represents or that it would be killed off by regulators. He then surmised his position:\n“I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form.”\nFinally, before moving onto other topics, Pinto addressed the interviewer’s mention of JPMorgan’s competitors starting to open up to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Rather than referring to the Goldman Sachs trading desk that appears to be launching imminently, he seemed to address the CME Group and Cboe futures contracts, however:\n“If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.”\nThe rest of the interview was taken up with Pinto addressing various other financial concerns. These included: the wider economy which he claimed was in ‘very good shape,’ investment opportunities in China, when the end of the current economic expansion would be, and JPMorgan Chase’s relationship with tech giants Amazon.\nDaniel Pinto was awarded the title of co-president of JPMorgan back in January of this year. He and his partner Gordon Smith are in line to take over the position of prominent Bitcoin naysayer Jamie Dimon should there be call to do so during the next few years.

Square started accepting Bitcoin in 2014 before nearly any other major credit card processing or payments platforms, and Dorsey has long been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nWhen @jack himself walked onstage to close out the Consensus conference in New York City, moderator Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs couldn't help but reference a famous crypto tweet about Jack Dorsey walking into a Bitcoin conference.\nJack Dorsey walking into the Bitcoin conference pic.twitter.com/ibQfgh3noa\n— Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) November 15, 2017 Dorsey touched on a host of different topics during his appearance: Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency landscape; the role both Square and Twitter might play in using and advancing blockchain technology; and why he thinks it's only a matter of time before we have a global digital currency. Here are some of the higlights.\nOn Square's decision to support Bitcoin in 2014 :\nDorsey: I didn't really understand the implications of it until three or four years ago when we had some Square engineers who wanted to build Bitcoin acceptance into our online store. I said yes, it took about three or four months, and they made it so any seller could accept Bitcoin without knowing they were taking Bitcoin at all.\nOn the backlash to supporting Bitcoin as a public company:\nDorsey: This was a pretty contentious move in the company. We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were skeptics of the technology. [Square] always takes the mindset that we can't wait for things to happen to us. If we want responsible, healthy uses of this technology that I believe is a fundamental shift in our world with so many positive outcomes, we need to make that happen.\nWe pushed through and it really tested us. Not just because we're a public company, but because there was more of a spotlight on us. There are a lot of unknowns, and we just ran toward them and tried to figure them out.\nOn adding support to Square Cash in 2017:\nDorsey: With Square Cash another opportunity came up back in January 2017. I saw all these conversations on Twitter about it, and the community was interesting. It felt like Usenet all over again.\nAt a hackathon that January I asked one of our engineers if we could work on Bitcoin, and the next day we committed to a goal to build a system where using my Cash card I could go across the street to Twitter HQ and buy a cappucino with a Bitcoin. We worked all week and started listening to other folks as well. We almost got there...we ran into a deployment issue and didn't actually hit the goal but it felt electric. We decided to dedicate Mike [the engineer] to building Bitcoin within Square Cash.\"\nOn the inevitability of a global digital currency:\nDorsey: We want to continue to level the playing field and give people a chance to participate in the economy. I don't know whether it will be Bitcoin or something else, but I'm a huge fan and appreciate the technology and principles behind it. We're going to have a native currency that can be global, that was invented on the internet, evolved on the internet, critiqued on the internet, and developed on the internet. It's going to happen.\nOn Square's role in the future of cryptocurrency:\nDorsey: The biggest thing I worry about as a company is making sure nothing from a corporate standpoint ever threatens the openness of the community and the open-source nature of cryptocurrency. No corporation or goverment body should own this. We're a centralized organization, but we can benefit from decentralization and I want to see more of it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6307-getting-started-with-bitcoin-in-cash-app", "https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/square-market-accepts-bitcoin-b1a2abce5eb", "https://t.co/ibQfgh3noa", "https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/930628771773853702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "elizabeth stark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neeraj k. agrawal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain twitter and square", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lightning labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:11:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "042f2ef4e3096796e2ce25f58210ddd43433176d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUuIVrIb9IQS_mwQ_kESQlECzRQD0eRSufZ90sEH9rg3tS5jXV3mARt_0szdbRDkqQ65Cp7NKwqq0.6xSjWdFw4s_QoaRQP__AbUJoyWAViTB1LY0t6avxI58TZREcln3S1pq0qNvyhgSZVjv2jONq7sTJ7TklM7lg6QdA4ul_3.A--", "site_full": "news.morningstar.com", "site": "morningstar.com", "site_section": "http://news.morningstar.com/all/dow-jones/financials.aspx", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "News Archive: Financials", "title": "Bitcoin May Be Down, but a Digital Currency Startup Soars -- Update", "title_full": "Bitcoin May Be Down, but a Digital Currency Startup Soars -- Update", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.316, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "042f2ef4e3096796e2ce25f58210ddd43433176d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUuIVrIb9IQS_mwQ_kESQlECzRQD0eRSufZ90sEH9rg3tS5jXV3mARt_0szdbRDkqQ65Cp7NKwqq0.6xSjWdFw4s_QoaRQP__AbUJoyWAViTB1LY0t6avxI58TZREcln3S1pq0qNvyhgSZVjv2jONq7sTJ7TklM7lg6QdA4ul_3.A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "morningstar.com", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin May Be Down, but a Digital Currency Startup Soars -- Update", "text": "By Telis Demos\nA digital-currency startup backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is now worth about $3 billion after a new fundraising round.\nCircle Internet Financial Ltd. disclosed the new valuation Tuesday, making it one of the most highly valued financial technology startups in the U.S.\nThe increase in the Boston-based trading firm's value, more than seven times the level achieved at a prior fundraising in 2016, stems from the recent explosion of interest in bitcoin and other so-called digital assets.\nIndeed, despite a 40% decline this year, bitcoin is still making fortunes for companies that deal in the volatile currency. In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group. Goldman is not among the new round's investors.\nFive-year-old Circle's first product was designed for buying bitcoin and moving traditional money between individuals by using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nBut in the past year, its other business, facilitating big trades of digital currencies, has surged in volume and revenue.\nThat desk, called Circle Trade, says it has traded about $4 billion in the past month, handling trades from institutions, companies and wealthy individuals, Circle said. The company has said it generated $250 million in revenue from November to January.\nBy one measure, Circle is now the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency startup. Its $3 billion equity valuation surpasses that of Coinbase, which raised money at a $1.6 billion valuation late last year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\nCircle is one of a handful of so-called over-the-counter market makers who augment the smaller-value trades on exchanges, alongside such firms as Cumberland Mining. At least one big bank, Goldman, is exploring a role for itself in trading around cryptocurrencies.\nAs part of the funding, Bitmain will also join Circle's new project to launch new digital coins that can be exchanged for a fixed amount of traditional, or fiat, currency.\nJeremy Allaire, Circle's chief executive and co-founder, said the new coin and fundraising is part of the company's \"long-term vision for what's possible in building a new global economic system.\"\nCircle also recently acquired a digital asset exchange, Poloniex, and a retail investment application, now called Circle Invest.\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com\n(END) 16, 2018 13:08 ET (17:08 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "telis demos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital currency startup soars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle internet financial ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:04:06.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da7ee9ee8fc6ae46aa36a0d748fa87a2be7ee6ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2wVwv1GOz6Msy5xK737ZFABw8Ekw2S.t5sWsmdlgeKcSRFP4zPc2NVpKsmkDgE53bbZdWhtZ02t1pxnMxcAb1Hyc_zs4pcy6jjD0tauuQWClfKakQJVCde.wrcAhE7QLBbXSVxL8QFJUp6LQqzXo7", "site_full": "www.bloomberg.com", "site": "bloomberg.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Equipment Maker Canaan Files for $1 Billion IPO - Bloomberg", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining Equipment Maker Canaan Files for $1 Billion IPO - Bloomberg", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibtVAfPRlc50/v1/1200x800.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 356, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 233, "comments": 0, "shares": 233}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da7ee9ee8fc6ae46aa36a0d748fa87a2be7ee6ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2wVwv1GOz6Msy5xK737ZFABw8Ekw2S.t5sWsmdlgeKcSRFP4zPc2NVpKsmkDgE53bbZdWhtZ02t1pxnMxcAb1Hyc_zs4pcy6jjD0tauuQWClfKakQJVCde.wrcAhE7QLBbXSVxL8QFJUp6LQqzXo7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Crystal Tse", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Equipment Maker Canaan Files for $1 Billion IPO - Bloomberg", "text": "Canaan Inc., the world’s second-biggest maker of bitcoin mining hardware, submitted a listing application to the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nMorgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are joint sponsors of the proposed offering, according to a preliminary prospectus posted late Tuesday. Bloomberg News reported earlier Tuesday that Canaan had filed for an IPO that could raise about $1 billion. The filing didn’t say how much Canaan will seek.\nCanaan aims to start trading as soon as July, a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The company, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, had revenue of 1.3 billion yuan ($205 million) last year. Net income surged more than sixfold to 361 million yuan, according to Tuesday’s filing.\nA listing of Canaan would be the first Hong Kong IPO from the cryptocurrency industry. The company has about 15 percent of the global market for bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, trailing Chinese rival Bitmain , according to a February report from Sanford C.

The company’s hardware often ends up in remote locales housing large mining pools that depend on cheap electricity, Co-Chairman Jianping Kong said in an April interview.\nCanaan co-Chairman Jianping Kong, right, with founder and CEO N.G.

BTC/USD broke this week’s directional station with support in $8,500 about the hourly graph (data feed from Kraken). The pair settled under an integral support at $8,400 along with also the 100 hourly easy moving average. Bitcoin cost made a sharp U-turn from $8,800 from the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently trading well under $8,500 using a couple bearish signs. Bitcoin Price Analysis The previous two times were mostly positive to get bitcoin cost over the $8,600 support against the US Dollar. However, the cost failed to move over the $8,800 immunity area. Buyers fought to set the purchase price over $8,800, which led to a disadvantage movement. The price dropped sharply and bankrupt a few service amounts for example $8,700, $8,600 and $8,400. The decrease was substantial since the cost settled under an integral support at $8,400 along with also the 100 hourly simple moving average . During the decrease, BTC/USD broke this week’s directional station with assistance in $8,500 about the hourly graph. The pair traded near to the 8,000 support amount and a reduced was shaped at $8,080. At the second, the cost is consolidating over $8,000s, using an initial resistance round the 23.6 percent Fib retracement level of the final decrease from the $2,854 climbed to $8,080 low. However, the most significant barrier on the upside is at $8,400 and $8,500, that were affirms before. Looking in the chart , the price action indicates a great deal of directional signs under $8,500. It might fix a few points at the brief term, but it’s very likely to confront sellers around the upside 8,500. On the disadvantage, a break below the $8,000 support might perhaps push the cost further to some bearish zone.

Speaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc , reiterated his support for the virtual coin, but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board.\n\"We have a lot of healthy scepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly sceptics of this technology,\" Dorsey said. \"There is still a lot of scepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.\"\nHe added that the \"healthy discussion\" around bitcoin extended \"all the way at the board level\", without elaborating on specifics.\nIn January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin.\nThe company made $34.1 million (£25.2 million) in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.\nProponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply.\nBut it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility, slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability.\nThe volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets. The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\nBy Anna Irrera and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:30:15.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4373769a591fe5fc9826c2275982228b76b3d073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrS3BjTSBi39Bg9XyZgLBJoStfjj62eYR3E3jme81Gj6izid4naZhQT5HnlCp9KRZpX61Lj63M0DFpL2QIZKvJNNjPWjnFvb76DQ229X_DGXgyXX_Xi_MtR", "site_full": "buzzeology.com", "site": "buzzeology.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption | Buzzeology", "title_full": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption | Buzzeology", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4373769a591fe5fc9826c2275982228b76b3d073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrS3BjTSBi39Bg9XyZgLBJoStfjj62eYR3E3jme81Gj6izid4naZhQT5HnlCp9KRZpX61Lj63M0DFpL2QIZKvJNNjPWjnFvb76DQ229X_DGXgyXX_Xi_MtR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption | Buzzeology", "text": "Home CryptoCurrency 32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption | Buzzeology 32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption | Buzzeology By\n32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption .\nTechnology\nOn May 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community upgraded the chain’s base block measurement from 8MB to 32MB. The tool development makes blocks sufficiently big to procedure a whole lot of transactions over the years — which supplies builders various respiring room to regulate the scale if it begins getting nearer to its restrict. Unfortunately, many misdirected people think the BCH chain will get started processing 32MB blocks instantly, which might result in a blockchain chain that’s a lot better in gigabyte measurement and takes longer to obtain. However, this is now not the case at this time in any respect, as a result of BCH miners procedure blocks which might be incessantly nonetheless underneath 1MB, because the 32MB code is best set to make sure the community is succesful at some point. Also Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features The Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption After the Bitcoin Cash community upgraded the day prior to this or even sooner than the fork, a couple of faulty people requested why there used to be a wish to elevate the block measurement fourfold when 8MB blocks weren’t filling simply but. The explanation why builders raised the restrict to 32MB is most likely for the reason that tool is completely able to dealing with any such activity at some point. Right now block measurement limits are set by means of the miner, and builders are there to assist set the capability so blocks can not get complete within the quick long run, and costs will stay low for moderately a while. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) community, Core builders let the block measurement fill past capability, and costs changed into unreliable all the way through the remaining quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block measurement adjustment guarantees this won’t occur to the BCH community down the street, even if transaction utilization turns into as excessive as 2017’s remaining quarter. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) neighborhood and builders don’t seem to be scared of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th improve is the second one a success laborious fork at the BCH community.Looking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a web page which data BCH chain information lately displays that mining limits are being set by means of the mining pool. Over the previous 9 months, there were a couple of 2,four, and 8MB blocks processed, however generally blocks were a megabyte or much less. So in essence, as soon as miners come to a decision its vital to extend the block sizes they procedure, they’re going to achieve this in accordance with transactions and adoption expanding over the years. In truth, present information additionally displays the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is nonetheless 34.4GB better than the Bitcoin Cash chain. After the block measurement build up miners don’t seem to be processing 32MB blocks, the improve used to be supposed to make sure they may be able to care for that capability at some point. Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by means of 186% in Nine Months At the instant Bitcoin Cash transactions in step with day are lower than BTC as there are kind of 20-25,000 day-to-day BCH transactions. But there’s additionally been a misdirected perception that the BCH chain isn’t getting a lot use, however this is merely unfaithful as information displays during the last 9 months that BCH day-to-day transaction proportion charges have larger. The decentralized foreign money BCH has noticed a gentle incline (186%) of use for the reason that August 1 fork and the growth of BCH transactions at the moment are best Five-10,000 transactions much less in step with day than the Litecoin (LTC) community — a cryptocurrency that has been round for 7 years. This is due partly to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms just like the tipping bot Tippr, the social media apps Memo and Blockpress, and different programs that assist build up BCH utilization. In simply 9 months Bitcoin Cash has greater than doubled its transaction depend, and the BCH day-to-day transaction price is slightly below LTC’s day-to-day transactions in step with day. 32X the Capacity is Merely Preparation for the Future of Bitcoin Cash Adoption Essentially the base line is the tool is now able to processing 32MB blocks because it used to be up to now able to 8MB blocks. So a ways BCH miners had confirmed the aptitude of mining a lot better blocks than 1MB a couple of occasions, clearing 1000’s of transactions from the mempool. After the a success fork on May 15, some BCH supporters are already asking builders to take away the block measurement restrict fully. The hilarious TX Highway has up to date to 32 lanes. Moreover, we all know from trying out that the Bitcoin tool is able to processing gigabyte blocks, and analysis research additional counsel the community may just care for terabyte blocks as smartly. Unlike different virtual asset builders, BCH programmers have set the bar prime for capability in accordance with the identified developments in scaling a cryptocurrency community. Instead of claiming “we don’t need to scale now,” the 32MB build up establishes a base block measurement that may successfully care for 32X extra transactions than the BTC community’s best day-to-day transaction price recorded this previous December.

We also know this fact that Bitcoin hardfork usually occurs due to blocksize. Here the battle is between two of the most famous Bitcoin binaries, BTC and BCH (Bitcoin Cash) . BTC is developing its second layer of blockchain ‘ The Lightening Network ‘ whereas BCH is increasing its block size directly from 8MB to 32MB , yet both are struggling to prove themselves the “True Bitcoin” but in order to do so, they are basically pulling each other’s legs in this process. Their explanations regarding the hardfork scenario are totally different from one another.\nSome of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer. Many miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected. Bitcoin Cash\nThis community thinks that Bitcoin (core) developers don’t want the community to grow and they have abandoned the original Bitcoin version by refusing to increase the block size. Whereas Bitcoin (core) developers think that this accusation is wrong and block size was imposed by Satoshi himself.\nSatoshi added the 1M consensus limit in 2010, intentionally set above the free market fee range. This artificial ceiling acts against network DoS, raising the cost of attack. Setting the limit above free market range resulted in a safety limit reasonably free from politics. Bitcoin (core) developer\nWhile these two are still fighting, talking about Ethereum and Ethereum Classic , we find peace between both communities. They ended their war and both of them focus on their own development rather than accusing each other. Samson Mow (BTC) and Roger Ver (BCH) argued with one another in the recent Deconomy conference. They are even fighting over Twitter and more drama has been shown there.\nJimmy Song (Bitcoin Dev) has also presented his opinion about these two opposite factions which are trying to bring each other down. By classifying these opposite groups, he defines their motives and statements as: “crypto-Keynesian” – BTC says that transaction throughput was essential if Bitcoin had any real-life value. It’s a movable asset and that’s it. On the other hand “crypto-Austrians”– (BCH) insist that they want “sound-money” and “transaction throughput is subservient to this overriding goal”.\nIf we look at the scenario generally, we will realize that both the groups and parties have different ideologies and that is the reason for their split. They should ignore each other’s existence and focus on the goals which will bring their community to the level of massive success.

Morgan Chase in 1983 as a currency trader in Buenos Aires. Thanks to his ability to manage risk in a series of roles, Pinto has climbed the ranks. In 2014, he was named head of the firm's corporate and investment bank, the world's biggest by revenue.\nIn January, he was named co-president of J.P. Morgan. That means he and partner Gordon Smith, who leads the consumer bank, are in line to succeed long-time CEO Jamie Dimon if the need arises within the next few years.\nshow chapters J.P. Morgan names co-COOs and co-presidents Daniel Pinto, Gordon Smith 5:20 PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 | 03:42 In an exclusive interview at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters and in a follow-up phone conversation, Pinto explains his views on a global economy in the latter stages of expansion, the opportunities he sees and how his bank is preparing for the inevitable downturn.\nCNBC: You spend a lot of time flying around the world visiting clients, leaders in industries from tech to energy. What are they telling you about the state of the economy?\nPinto: Pretty much everyone agrees that the economy is in very good shape. Obviously, there are different dynamics in each of the sectors. For example, this week I was in Houston talking with some of the oil companies. They are quite positive about the economy, about oil prices maintaining a range, and they are quite positive about investments going into the sector.\nWe have all these companies reporting earnings, and overall the results seem fine. The technical aspects of the markets are more balanced than they were late last year, where it was pretty much one view, and that view was that the markets will improve no matter what. So you have a bunch of components, from the technical part, to the economy performing and companies performing, which altogether makes me quite positive on the economy.\nCNBC: Where are you seeing opportunities now? You recently applied to Chinese regulators for a majority stake in a joint venture to control a business in a rapidly growing part of the world.\nPinto: The opportunities in China are huge. You have a country that clearly is headed, in a slow way, towards deregulation, allowing foreign companies to have a majority stake in the financial services industry. It's a massive equity market, a massive bond market. The payments space is evolving extremely fast. So the opportunity is great. It will be a big contribution to J.P. Morgan and we will contribute to the Chinese market as the years go by and we keep growing our presence there. In particular, the joint venture will allow us to participate more deeply in the local equity markets, do underwritings, things like that.\nCNBC: Will China be your bank's second-biggest national market after the U.S. when it comes to revenue? How long will that take, a decade?\nPinto: Yes. I have no doubt it will be, and it will happen a lot faster than 10 years.\nBitcoin CNBC: Are cryptocurrencies another opportunity for you? Your competitors already help trade bitcoin futures and are preparing to get more involved in trading digital currencies.\nPinto: We are looking into that space. I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role. [Regarding bitcoin], you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities. That will have a very short life, because people will stop believing in it, or the regulators will kill it. I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form.\nIf we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.\nCNBC: The current economic expansion is nearing a decade in age, double the average length. When does it end?\nPinto: Obviously, there will be an end to the economic cycle at some point. I don't think it's coming any time soon. If you asked me when I thought the economy is going to slow down, I'd follow [JPMorgan Chief U.S. economist] Mike Feroli. He says that the probability of a recession is extremely low in 2018, it's higher in 2019, but still low. And it probably starts going up in 2020.\nCNBC: What would trigger a recession?\nPinto: In the U.S., the risk is inflation. Does the Fed have to raise interest rates a lot faster than what the market is expecting or pricing in? For everything we can see, inflation is going up slightly, but in a very moderate way. That's why I think the probability of that happening this year or next year is relatively low.\nBut the Fed will continue to hike, and at some point that hike in rates will slow down the U.S. economy. I don't believe that that is a crisis. It's just a correction at the end of the cycle that will trigger the beginning of the next cycle.\nDealing with a bear market CNBC: You've said that within two or three years , the stock market could see a correction of 30 to 40 percent. How are you preparing the firm for this?\nPinto: When you're going towards the end of the cycle, you want to have an extra layer of prudence. [In the investment bank] we're going to start being more careful about the liquidity of the book, about the concentration of illiquid risk, about the correlations, about how the positions will trade through different stress scenarios. You keep modeling the book to something that you hope, when the correction starts happening, you are well positioned to continue to be a player in the market, and you aren't shutting yourself out. The worst-case scenario for any big player is that you end up being massively hammered when the correction happens, and you end up losing money because of your positions.\nCNBC: Many Wall Street traders today are relatively young because after the financial crisis, firms sought to cut costs by eliminating more experienced, expensive talent. Is that a concern, for the industry, when conditions turn nasty?\nPinto: All these people, whether they're senior or junior, lived in a bullish environment for the last 10 years. But I haven't, and many of my managers [have more experience], so we are prepared.\nCNBC: In the past decade, you've seen the rise of passive investments, the rise of computerized traders like quants, at the same time that regulations have curbed the ability for investment banks to deploy capital in markets. Will that impact the severity of the correction?\nPinto: All these electronic, algorithmic traders, they provide a lot of liquidity in calm markets. So today, you can trade as much as you want every day. When the correction happens, these players tend to fall away, which exacerbates the moves. There's not as much smart capital [from investment banks] to really provide that rational support to market levels.\nThat's why when the correction happens, or we have some kind of bad news, the market becomes very volatile and trading volumes shrink massively. We know how to prepare for those times, and over these days, we are slightly more conservative than we would've been a couple of years ago. We try to get through the difficult times as intact as possible to continue to provide liquidity to support the clients. That is in the minds of all the risk managers that we have, all my management team.\nAmazon as partner and competitor CNBC: Let's look a little further out. What about competition from tech firms like Amazon , which is reportedly looking to make a push into consumer banking by offering a checking account?\nPinto: We work closely with Amazon. If there are things we can do together, we will try them. That doesn't preclude them from trying to be strong in financial services, to be strong in health care, in whatever they want to be, if they are allowed. The worst thing you can do is ignore it. You have to assume in some way or another, they will get involved.\nThere's only one thing you can do. It's to create services that are as good as possible, and the best client experience, to have a shot. Ultimately, consumers will decide.\nWATCH: JPM's Kelly says this is about as good as it gets show chapters This is about as good as it gets: JPM's Kelly 4:57 PM ET Fri, 27 April 2018 | 03:24", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simon dawson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "daniel pinto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gordon smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jp morgan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pmorgan chase & co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p. morgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park ave.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buenos aires", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T14:09:43.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64a206e728c5d8e59e2e98065486afcd965b8f5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0shsybf_yxVnSK_.sWbi38-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

The road to achieve this is pretty much straightforward: all the Bitcoin Cash community needs to do is to focus on creating the tools for merchants to accept and use the cryptocurrency easily.\nIn South Africa, cryptocurrency’s push for mainstream adoption is getting a boost from a Bitcoin wallet called Centbee, which is helping South African expats send money to their family back home.\n“It’s surprising, but Africans really love cryptocurrency for a whole lot of reasons,” Lorien Gamaroff, co-CEO of Centbee, told CoinGeek. “You know, we do have a lot of people who don’t really have access to traditional banking services. We have people who work in other countries and live in South Africa and consistently trying to move money across border, and that’s really expensive.”\nGamaroff, an expert in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, co-founded Centbee with Angus Brown, who has 20 years of experience in payments and banking. Together, the two are building not just a wallet, but an entire ecosystem that uses Bitcoin Cash.\n“Centbee is trying to make it easy for people to use Bitcoin Cash,” Gamaroff said. “Right now, if you want to use Bitcoin Cash, it’s quite complex, you know. It has a lot of concepts that are quite alien to people, specifically the addresses and the confirmation times and so on. What we’re trying to do is we’re trying to make the experience very much like using it in existing social media app like WhatsApp or Twitter because we think that people are used to using those apps, and if the Bitcoin experience is exactly the same is that then the adoption will grow a lot more.”\nBitcoin is always meant to be cash\nWith its promise of delivering a game-changing ecosystem replacement, Centbee has attracted high-profile investors from the blockchain field. Blockchain research and development firm nChain Group has already taken an equity stake in the South African company through its investment entity nChain Reaction Ltd.\nAccording to Gamaroff, mainstream adoption won’t happen until people see ways to use their cryptocurrency—not as a kind of gold or investment vehicle, but as cash.\n“What I like about Bitcoin Cash is that it’s reminding us that this was always meant to be cash, but cash needs to be able to be spent, and so we are focusing heavily on creating tools for merchants to accept Bitcoin Cash easily and simply, and I think that is going to be a real drive,” he said.\nBitcoin Cash has taken yet another step closer towards merchant adoption, thanks to the successful May 15 network upgrade. The upgrade not only saw Bitcoin Cash’s block size increase to 32MB, but also restored certain OP_Codes for advanced functionalities. Restoring the OP_Codes would unleash the smart contract and tokenization capability on the security backbone that is Bitcoin.\nThree days after the network upgrade, CoinGeek will hold its inaugural CoinGeek conference. The conference, happening at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong on May 18, and will be the perfect opportunity to discuss the advances generated by the network upgrade with experts in the area. Gamaroff, along with nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen, Chief Scientist Dr. Craig Wright and other thought leaders, will be on hand to provide their expertise on a wide range of topics related to eCommerce, advancements in the BCH technology and the future of the crypto space. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna irrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wnmt square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:14:25.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38093f847d6fcd2dbf76208e61211ec930759df7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_0t6SG.fylIy_IwgJIQDTY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38093f847d6fcd2dbf76208e61211ec930759df7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_0t6SG.fylIy_IwgJIQDTY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInstall our official extension in Mozilla Firefox Store to start earning BTC – To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg More The value of cryptocurrencies is ultimately going to accrue to the token, not necessarily the operating business or cash flow of the networks, Union Square Ventures’ managing partner and co-founder Fred Wilson said at the 2018 Consensus Conference in New York Wednesday. \"When someone like Warren Buffett looks at that, he thinks, that’s no good, where’s the cash flow?

This is the first documentary of its kind to be featured at the “European capital of cinema,” and the deal itself is worth seven figures. Slate Entertainment Group has supported the production and release of the film, and they are the creators of the SLATE (SLX) blockchain network . However, the release of ‘Beyond Bitcoin’ is not planned until March 2019. Bitcoin Isn’t the Main Character\nEven though bitcoin is in the title, this documentary is actually about the use and application of the altcoin and anything that is separate from bitcoin. The two main altcoins that the documentary will use to inform consumers are DASH and LISK .\nIn the feature film, consumers will learn about what is called the “ICO-fever.” However, it also will address how regulators play a major role in the investments and blockchain, and how Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are separate. Three Main Crypto Figures Take the Lead\nThough this documentary will serve as an informative option for consumers that need to learn their place in crypto, there will also be three individuals that take the lead as well. Those three people are Ryan Radloff, Perianne Boring, and Roger Ver, and the documentary follows them through the course of a year in the life of each one.\nRyan Radloff is a financier in the crypto world and is the CEO of CoinShare UK. His company keeps a record of accomplishment for crypto investments, specifically addressing the fit-for-purpose platforms. Much of the company is made up of the former employees at JP Morgan, State Street, and Lehman Brothers.\nPerianne Boring is a blockchain diplomat and an Adjunct Professor that teaches students about blockchain with Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. She is also the President of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which is located in Washington DC. The entire point of the Chamber is to make blockchain more mainstream for use.\nRoger Ver is known as an anarcho-capitalist, and he was one of the first investors to get on board with bitcoin . In his opinion, “Bitcoin is the most important invention in the history of the world since the internet.” The Crew of ‘Beyond Bitcoin’\nBritish director Jake Witzenfield heads up the documentary, and he is accompanied by Fulwell 73, which is James Corden’s production company. Witzenfield has some experience as a director for one documentary and one episode of a small television program. Fulwell 73 is responsible for bringing ‘The Late Late Show with James Corden,’ ‘One Direction 3D: This is Us,’ and ‘I Am Bolt,’ to life.\nThe involvement of Fulwell 73 with Slate is a welcomed one. Leo Pearlman, the co-founder of Fulwell 73, has said that, “Binge is the perfect fit for our film and is the natural place for viewers to find and engage with this content.” By introducing Binge, there are multiple tools that have never been brought to the big screen.

(I have occasionally also argued that the story of cryptocurrency might actually be the opposite, that it’s about traveling back in time to progressively forget the lessons of modern finance, but never mind that.)\nIn many ways this is a snarky and condescending thing to think; the implication is that the crypto people had simplistic and naive expectations about how trustless decentralized purely market-based finance could work, and are slowly discovering the obvious-to-the-rest-of-us benefits of trust and central counterparties and regulation and non-market mechanisms. On this theory, financial history is a journey from darkness into enlightenment, and those of us who have seen the light can watch in amusement as cryptocurrencies make the same journey.\nOn the other hand that’s not actually how many people think of financial history! “The most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine,” Paul Volcker famously said, and there are plenty of people who would argue that at least the past few decades of financial history have been a story of reckless deregulation, risk, scandal, inequality, over-financialization and rent-seeking. On this view, if cryptocurrency does quickly repeat the history of conventional finance—if in two years we end up with too-big-to-fail Bitcoin banks that use chat rooms to manipulate crypto indexes and set up fake accounts for their users—then that will be bad. Cryptocurrency’s original promise wasn’t simplistic and naive; it was idealistic and pure, and importing all the controversial features of scandal-plagued modern finance will be a tragedy.\nAnyway Bitcoin has discovered co-location for high-frequency traders:\nCoinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading. ...\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times.\nCoinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location.\nThat’s fine! Catering to professional market makers—having professional market makers, for that matter—is probably a way to make the market better and more useful for most investors. “These additions will allow for a more efficient price discovery process to occur, creating tighter markets, deeper liquidity, and increased certainty of execution,” says Coinbase. It is a stage of enlightenment, an adoption of useful ideas from conventional finance. (Along with the co-location, Coinbase is also “developing several tools to lure institutional investors onto its platform,” including “custodial services where investors can store large amounts of digital currencies”; obviously having a safe place to put your Bitcoins would be a positive development—and a change from Bitcoin’s original promise of decentralization.)\nOn the other hand that’s not actually how many people think about exchanges that cater to high-frequency traders! I mean, co-location, my word:\nCoinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nSome number of people got into Bitcoin because they felt like the conventional financial system was rigged against them, and I suspect that some number of them felt like that because stock exchanges let high-frequency traders pay to run their algorithms right next to the exchanges’ servers so they could have faster access to the exchange than anyone else. And now here we are.\nObviously neither of these narratives is really right; financial history is not a story of uninterrupted progress to pure efficiency nor one of absolute corruption by evil entrenched interests. It’s mostly a series of good-faith tradeoffs under uncertainty, many of which could conceivably have gone the other way. U.S. securities laws, for instance, have an onerous and one-size-fits-all set of disclosure requirements for anyone who wants to raise money by selling securities to the general public; this makes it much easier to police fraud, but also makes it harder for disruptive entrepreneurs to raise money to fund real projects and for small investors to participate in high-growth investments. And there are those in the crypto community who argue that the tradeoff should go the other way in cryptocurrency regulation: Let a million blockchain projects bloom, accept that most of them will be frauds, but do it anyway to foster innovation.\nThat is interesting, or at least potentially interesting. (Not all of the regulators are moved by it! But some seem to be.) Watching cryptocurrency create an alternate financial history, one in which some of those choices go another way, in which the balance is struck (say) in favor of more fraud and more innovation, or more democracy and less professionalization, or whatever, is the real appeal of the cryptocurrency revolution. If, after learning all of its lessons, it just converges entirely on old-fashioned finance—but with a different set of powerful incumbent billionaires—then what was the point?\nElsewhere in crypto exchanges, here's a story about how Israeli crypto exchange eToro will open to U.S. investors. And: “Crypto Exchange Kraken Says It Will Probably Register With SEC.” And: “‘Privacy Coin’ ZCash Lands on Winklevoss’s Gemini Exchange.”\nAnd elsewhere in crypto, the Consensus 2018 conference is going on in New York this week and it is exhausting just to read about. Here’s a story about how the BitMex exchange rented some Lamborghinis to sit around revving outside the conference because, you know, crypto Bitcoin blockchain Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo. Here's a story about how “the smell of marijuana wafted through a half-filled event space in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District, as a group of cryptocurrency believers downed champagne and blood orange margaritas” and listened to Snoop Dogg at an afterparty thrown by Ripple Labs Inc.:\nAround 9 p.m., Snoop Dogg arrived to an adoring crowd sporting Patagonia fleeces, button-up shirts and Team Ripple tees.\n“So what we get drunk, so what we smoke weed,” they sang along as Snoop strutted onstage flanked by dancers in rhinestone bras and a person in a canine costume, wearing a jacket with ‘Dirty Dogg’ written on the back.\nDo you think that the majority of people at the majority of Snoop Dogg shows circa 2018 are wearing button-up shirts and Patagonia fleeces? Surely yes, right? These days I feel like the dress code for any Snoop Dogg show is probably business casual.\nCBS v. Redstone.\nWe talked yesterday about CBS Corp.’s amazing effort to get rid of its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., by issuing enough voting stock to other shareholders to dilute away NAI’s control. The point of this effort would be to prevent Redstone and NAI from using their voting power to fire CBS’s directors and try to force through a merger with Viacom Inc., another company controlled by Redstone. A flaw in CBS’s plan is that it had to give Redstone notice of the board meeting (scheduled for tomorrow) at which it will issue those new shares, and so she can fire them before they hold that meeting. But it asked a Delaware court to enjoin her from doing that, so it could go and get rid of her in peace.\nLater yesterday NAI filed its reply to that lawsuit, which denies the basic conflict that CBS claimed—\nPlaintiffs suggest that NAI intends to force such a merger by removing and replacing the CBS independent directors. There is no truth to that. NAI does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS Board or taking other action to force a merger. Plaintiffs’ supposed belief to the contrary is based on unsourced media reports and conjecture.\n—but also notes that, even if it were true, diluting away Redstone’s ownership “would still be egregiously overbroad and unjustified”:\nIf Plaintiffs were genuinely concerned that NAI would seek to force a merger upon the company, and NAI had not committed to refrain from doing so during the pendency of this action, the relief to which Plaintiffs would even plausibly be entitled would be an injunction to prevent NAI from forcing a merger upon the company while this litigation is pending. It would not be to dilute NAI’s voting power, for all purposes, now and forever. This is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder’s voting power.\nLook: That is obviously correct. If the controlling shareholder wants to do something bad and wrong over the board’s objection, then the board should say no. The board shouldn’t fire the controlling shareholder. That’s not even a thing. You can sort of understand the board’s point of view though. If the chief executive officer wanted to do something bad and wrong over the board’s objection, then the board really might fire him. Firing the CEO for doing bad things is how the board exerts its power, how it demonstrates that it is in control of the corporation. If the board really is supreme, if it is in control of the corporation and the shareholders are just sources of capital, then why shouldn’t it fire the shareholders too, if they make it mad enough?\nBy the way yesterday I expressed some surprise that the board would even try, but apparently there is precedent for boards trying to get rid of their controlling shareholders while the shareholders weren’t looking. (“You go on one long vacation out of cell-phone coverage and, bam, you’re out,” I wrote yesterday.) It didn’t work though. From NAI’s filing:\nThe proposed dilutive stock dividend would be invalid under Adlerstein v. Wertheimer. There, the Court recognized that where a controlling stockholder has the power to forestall board action by preemptively removing directors, the board cannot take steps to neutralize the controlling stockholder’s voting power in order to effectuate the board action. In Adlerstein, the controller had the power to remove certain directors and, recognizing this, the board kept the controller in the dark about a board proposal that destroyed his voting control over the corporation until it was too late for the controller to act. Recognizing that the controller was entitled to an adequate opportunity to protect his interests, the Court held that the directors’ decision to keep the controller uninformed about the proposal invalidated the board’s approval of the proposal.\nStill, good effort.\nOh, disclosure: CBS’s lawyers here are from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where I worked long ago. I remain very fond of Wachtell, and I don’t think that I am biased when I say that it is undoubtedly the U.S.’s leading advocate of the theory of “board primacy” in corporate governance. I don’t really think they will, but if they do convince a Delaware court that boards of directors should be able to get rid of shareholders they disagree with, then that would be quite a total victory for board primacy.\nShould index funds be illegal?\nNo, write Thomas Lambert and Michael Sykuta of the University of Missouri, in “The Case for Doing Nothing About Institutional Investors’ Common Ownership of Small Stakes in Competing Firms”:\nWe show that the theory of anticompetitive harm from institutional investors’ common ownership is implausible and that the empirical studies supporting the theory are methodologically unsound. The theory fails to account for the fact that intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified and rests upon unrealistic assumptions about managerial decision-making. The empirical studies purporting to demonstrate anticompetitive harm from common ownership are deficient because they inaccurately assess institutional investors’ economic interests and employ an endogenous measure that precludes causal inferences.\nEven if institutional investors’ common ownership of competing firms did soften market competition somewhat, the proposed policy solutions would themselves create welfare losses that would overwhelm any social benefits they secured.\nThe point that “intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified” is worth emphasizing. When people worry that common ownership of multiple firms in the same industry by big institutional investors reduces competition in that industry—the antitrust worry that I often shorthand as “should index funds be illegal?”—the theory is more or less that if all the airlines raise prices, rather than compete with each other on price, then they will all make higher profits and benefit their common shareholders at the expense of customers. But, in general, the mutual funds also own the customers. Lambert and Sykuta write:\nIntra-industry diversified mutual funds tend also to be inter-industry diversified, and maximizing one industry’s profits requires supracompetitive pricing that tends to reduce the profits of firms in complementary industries. A leading Vanguard fund, for example, holds around 2% of each major airline (1.85% of United, 2.07% of American, 2.15% of Southwest, and 1.99% of Delta) but also holds:\n• 1.88% of Expedia Inc. (a major retailer of airline tickets),\n• 2.20% of Boeing Co. (a manufacturer of commercial jets),\n• 2.02% of United Technologies Corp. (a jet engine producer),\n• 3.14% of AAR Corp. (the largest domestic provider of commercial aircraft maintenance and repair),\n• 1.43% of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (a major automobile rental company), and\n• 2.17% of Accenture (a consulting firm for which air travel is a significant cost component).\nEach of those companies—and many others—perform worse when airlines engage in the sort of supracompetitive pricing (and corresponding reduction in output) that maximizes profits in the airline industry.\nIf you do want to believe the index-funds-should-be-illegal thesis, then it may not be as simple as “giant diversified mutual funds that own lots of companies in an industry want to maximize the profits of that industry in anti-competitive ways.” Their objective function has to be a bit broader: They must want to maximize the profits of corporations, broadly, at the expense of individual consumers (and workers). That is a more nebulous theory; it is not as simple as “companies in an industry should try to keep prices high and not undercut each other by competing for market share,” but more like “companies in every industry should try to keep corporate profits high generally and not undercut each other by being nice to household consumers or workers.” It is harder to see how corporate managers would maximize that. But it is a pleasingly Marxist diagnosis of institutional investors as advocates, not of reduced competition in any particular industry, but of the interests of the capitalist class generally against those of workers and consumers.\nPeople are worried about unicorns.\nPrivate markets, I sometimes say, are the new public markets; companies used to have to go public to raise a lot of money or create secondary liquidity or achieve widespread name recognition or whatever, but now they can do all of that in the private markets. Still companies do go public sometimes, often because their venture capitalists find it easier to cash out by selling to the public than by relying on the relatively limited liquidity in private secondary markets. But the VCs are working on fixing that problem too:\nNew Enterprise Associates, one of Silicon Valley’s largest venture-capital firms, plans to sell off a big chunk of its startup investments in response to a dearth of initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nThe firm plans to sell roughly $1 billion worth of its stakes in about 20 startups to a new firm it is seeking to create, one of the people said, in an effort to return capital to its limited-partner investors. These companies will mostly be those that initially raised money from NEA about eight to 10 years ago.\nI mean it is all just pots of money. You are a private company, you go to a pot of money called “venture capital,” it gives you some money, you grow, the venture capitalists want to cash out, you go public, and the VCs sell to another pot of money called “mutual funds” or whatever. If the VCs set up a new pot of money called, like, “private secondary liquidity funds” or whatever (you might want a catchier name), then you kind of get rid of the need to go public. The trick is that those funds have to look more like mutual funds than the VC funds do; if they are buying big high-valuation stakes in mature but somehow-not-yet-public companies, then they need to be big, and they can’t expect too many of those stakes to produce enormous returns. On the other hand they shouldn’t expect most of them to go bust, either; they should expect steady reliable returns from most of their mature private investments. They just have to accept that the private markets are the new public markets.\nElsewhere:\nSoftBank Group Corp.’s near-$100 billion Vision Fund has yet to close, but its acquisitive founder is already gauging interest for a second fund.\n“Vision Fund II will definitely come.

The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nNot everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move.\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\nRead more: Snoop Dogg, Dorsey bring crypto to masses during blockchain week\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,” Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s “Blockchain Week.” “We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.”\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net, Lily Katz in New York at lkatz31@bloomberg.net.\nTo contact the editors Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly Schuetz\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "twitter inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:56:26.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a1335d884760f41bb8f4b58b71c2520f4ad99b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv_9VLrM6KL05g3La_86FQ0sN_JLxHQ7mVuhbgxCK1jOfal5TR7JuIGVNR3z_QIMJNUvMOqp2bai.JvaQXpkjhQaRP2QnZd.Blv0YDLtn0TgbOufmHdNxhigrseekOyAZQDMYqziaMqCiPYwUxjuDqW.TwjCPCImKFZdZv44bQ8Ye7uF1ldrPAyErT_xIO885BMHPZAu7on4k-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Square's bitcoin move has caused internal disagreement: CEO Dorsey", "title_full": "Square's bitcoin move has caused internal disagreement: CEO Dorsey", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.zonebourse.com/reuters/2018-05-16T181557Z_2_LYNXNPEE4F1J8-OCABS_RTROPTP_3_CBUSINESS-US-CRYPTOCURRENCIES-SQUARE.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57026ba33851ca8b313d488ffbb428751574edba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv_9VLrM6KL05g3La_86FQ0sN_JLxHQ7mVuhbgxCK1jOfal5TR7JuIGVNR3z_QIMJNUvMOqp2bai.JvaQXpkjhQaRP2QnZd.Blv0YDLtn0TgbOufmHdNxhigrseekOyAZQDMYqziaMqCiPYwUxjuDqW7kJo8hBclEv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square's bitcoin move has caused internal disagreement: CEO Dorsey", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Square Inc's decision to allow users of its mobile app to buy and sell bitcoin this year was a \"pretty contentious move within the company\" and remains a source of internal tension, the payment processor's CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday. Speaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc , reiterated his support for the virtual coin, but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board.\n\"We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology,\" Dorsey said. \"There is still a lot of skepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.\"\nHe added that the \"healthy discussion\" around bitcoin extended \"all the way at the board level\", without elaborating on specifics.\nIn January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin.\nThe company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.\nProponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply.\nBut it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility, slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability.\nThe volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF BUBBLES", "text": "Whats new in the newest asset class ? HAS BITCOIN BOTTOMED? A BRIEF HISTORY OF BUBBLES 16 May 2018 | 3841 views | 0\nINTRODUCTION\nBitcoin is ten years old this year. Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and the first commercial use of blockchain. Since its creation in 2008, it has taken close to nine years for Bitcoin to reach stratospheric bubble territory. In 2017 alone, Bitcoin’s price increased 1,300%. But this was not even the strongest cryptocurrency performer. That honor goes to Ripple, at a staggering 36,000%!\nMany correctly argue that this is the biggest asset bubble in history. Driven by irrational investor exuberance and a fear of missing out (commonly known as ‘FOMO’), it was typical to see a 10x price increase across many cryptocurrencies in 2017. Stories abound the internet of people turning tiny investments, sometimes as little as a few hundred dollars, into millions. Within social media circles these people were referred to as ‘lambos’.\nAnd the common catchphrase became “When lambo?”, meaning when is your coin going to make you enough money to buy a Lamborghini? Even websites selling supercars were cropping up accepting only Bitcoin or Ethereum as payment.\nFast forward to May 2018, and we have seen a 65 percent drop in the price of Bitcoin – from its all time high; along with a major slump in the majority of cryptocurrency prices.\nTo understand why this has happened and whether this has further to go, it’s helpful if we turn to history.\nPARALLELS TO HISTORY – BUBBLES AND TECHNICAL INNOVATION\nThere are a number of historical precedents which can help us better understand the behavior of asset bubbles; two of which relate to mass technological innovation, like Bitcoin.\nBritish Railway Mania in the 1840s and the Dotcom Bubble of the late 1990s were both the result of large-scale technological innovation, which promised to change the world. The 1840s Railway Bubble was driven by new feats of engineering and the Dotcom Bubble was fueled by the creation of the internet. And both bubbles ended badly. Even the 2008 Sub-prime Mortgage Crisis involved an innovative financial derivative product which led to the world’s largest recession since The Great Depression. And now Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market, with many of its vagaries, built on innovative blockchain technology, promises to change the world.\nA review of all major asset bubbles in history (see table) suggests that price increases are most commonly driven by irrational investor behavior and fraud. Many investors also find it difficult to accurately measure the value of the underlying asset.\n• Dotcom Bubble: by 2004, some 9 years after the start of the dotcom bubble, less than half of the original companies remained and by 2015 the few that had survived became household names like Amazon and eBay. In fact, had you bought Amazon when it bottomed in September 2001, at around $6 per share you would have multiplied your investment 250x at today’s price! The Bubble ‘burst’ when it became obvious that companies were not making money. Companies were simply adding a ‘.com’ to their business name and seeing their stock price rise overnight. IPOs were making dishonest and unachievable profitability claims. There was a lot of FOMO price action as well.\n• 1840s British Railway Mania : investors had become enamored with the growth prospects of railway companies, induced by promotional deals (often making dishonest claims), driven by the allure of technological advancements in railway engineering. When the railway bubble eventually burst in 1846 – ten years after it began, the majority of rail companies went out of business and railway stocks were ruined. It took at least another 20 years before the market showed any signs of recovery.\n• 2008 Sub-prime Mortgage Crisis: was the result of an overheated property market in the USA which spread to Western Europe. It involved an innovative credit derivative product linked to sub-prime borrowers who couldn’t afford their mortgages. Mis-selling was rife. House prices nearly doubled between 2002-2006 and mortgage fraud or ‘condo flipping’ was rampant. It all came crashing down when Lehman Brothers announced it was insolvent in September 2008. Like Bitcoin, people found it difficult to value the underlying asset.\nOTHER BUBBLES OF NOTE\n• Japanese Bubble: in 1989, the value of the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo were greater than all the real estate in the entire state of California. Referred to as the lost decade (it actually lasted two decades), real estate experienced manic price activity, with prices in Tokyo’s prime neighborhoods rising to levels that made them 350 times more expensive than comparable land in Manhattan, New York.\n• South Sea Bubble: in 1720, in return for a loan of £7 million to finance the war against France, the House of Lords (UK) passed the South Sea Bill, which allowed the South Sea Company to monopolize trade with South America. The company even underwrote the national debt. Shares rose to 10x their value; speculation was rampant and all sorts of companies, some fraudulent or just optimistic were launched. The country went wild, stocks increased, and huge fortunes were made overnight. Unsurprisingly, stocks eventually crashed and people all over the country lost their money. There were also strong suggestions of fraud with repeated allegations that the South Sea Company manipulated the price of government debt.\n• Tulip Mania: in the 1600s, Tulip Mania gripped the Netherlands. The price of tulip bulbs skyrocketed in 1636, only to collapse a year later – soon after the introduction of cash settled futures in tulip bulbs. Price manipulation and fraudulent activity was also heavily present. However, it’s probably worth noting that much of the Dutch economy was unaffected when the tulip price collapsed. This will be much the same if the Bitcoin price collapses 100%. Indeed, the potential impact of a Bitcoin collapse to the wider economy is estimated to be similar to a 1% fall in the stock market.\n• Bitcoin Bubble: in 2017, nearly ten years after the creation of Bitcoin, it was common to see 10x price increases in many cryptocurrencies, which many investors associated with classic pump and dump price cycles. Bitcoin increased 1,300% in 2017, and it is not uncommon to hear of fraudulent activity associated with ICO fund raising.\nCOMMON HISTORICAL THEMES WE CAN LEARN FROM\n• Technology which promises to change the world provokes irrational behavior: technology-induced bubbles are nearly always driven by the development of new innovative technology which promises to change the world or acts as an opportunist subset for a wider economic climate or malaise, such as the 1840s railway boom and bust. History suggests that mass technological innovation takes many, many years to mature. In the case of the Dotcom Bubble, it took at least 15 years to achieve mass internet adoption after a crash.\n• Opaque underlying asset value : in all asset bubbles relating to technological change, the price jumps ahead of its underlying value. Price does not truly reflect the benefits derived from the asset. It is also difficult to measure. Disagreements over asset value are common. In the case of Bitcoin, the underlying asset is blockchain related technology and in the case of the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis, the underlying assets were opaque delinquent mortgages.\n• Investor exuberance : investors get excited about the potential for the new technology before capabilities are realised or even properly understood. They buy in the hope of perceived future benefits, often buying into largely unproven technology. Price action is usually driven by frenzied speculation in the lead up to a crash. Irrational investor behavior and a herd mentality are also common.\n• Fraudulent activity : bubbles nearly always involve fraudulent conduct or dishonesty. For example, the Dotcom Bubble involved IPO fraud and unfounded claims of future company profitability. The 2008 Financial Crisis involved mis-selling. The South Sea Bubble involved government debt manipulation. The 1840s Railway Stock Bubble involved dishonest promotional claims. And now the Cryptocurrency Bubble is littered with unsubstantiated and dishonest claims by ICOs. Pump and dump cycles are common soon after an ICO launch.\n• Correlation between futures and crashes: if history is anything to go by, crashes follow soon after the introduction of futures contracts. The price of tulips skyrocketed in 1636 only to collapse, a year later– not long after the Dutch created a futures market for buying bulbs. And we saw the Bitcoin price begin its large correction in December 2017, soon after CME and CBOE exchanges introduced Bitcoin futures.\nSUMMARY Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market align closely to common themes to major asset bubbles in history. The themes most commonly associated with bubbles include frenzied price activity, irrational investor behavior, fraud and asset values which are difficult to measure.\nDrawing parallels to bubbles relating to mass technological innovation would suggest Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market is no different.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:28:35.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f7041d14fed61c3dc351ae7cbf2b3db4ce2ed9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzdaCs1TpRJcVwFibsWFDFg-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f7041d14fed61c3dc351ae7cbf2b3db4ce2ed9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzdaCs1TpRJcVwFibsWFDFg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite your friends now to grow your network rapidly.

Is it possible at all to do so? - The Economic Times", "text": "By Pareen Lathia\nEvery few months, we hear that bitcoin has been banned by some country or the other. As early as 2013, bitcoin was \"banned\" by Thailand. In 2017, it was big news when China banned bitcoin and the latest news carries a ban by the Indian Reserve Bank.\nThe problem is this news is grossly misleading because it is simply not possible to ban bitcoin, or any crypto currency for that matter.\nBitcoin’s price last year was hovering around $1,000 mark whereas right now, it is in the $9,000 range. This is in spite of the all the bans. This does not fit into any market logic. But that is the beauty of crypto currencies. They do not fit into traditional regulatory or banking framework. A different outlook is needed to understand how they work and why they were created in the first place.\nDecentralisation\nThis is because bitcoin and most crypto currencies that run on Blockchain technology are decentralised. It means they do not run on one server or URL or IP address. These virtual currencies run on multiple nodes that can be owned and run by anyone and are usually spread across the globe. There is no central point for the governments to attack or block.\nThis is very similar to Torrent protocol. It is peer-to-peer. At the simplest level, if I hold bitcoin in my wallet and transfer it to your wallet, there is no way any government can block it because this entry of transfer is recorded in a distributed ledger.\nWhat has RBI done?\nSo, what is this ban? If you read the RBI circular, they have never used the words \"ban\" pertaining to bitcoins. It has only prevented any organisation regulated by the central bank to deal with businesses that have anything to do with crypto currencies. Practically, this means banks will have to stop deposits and withdrawals to and from Indian rupee on crypto currency exchanges. This news spread widely and was seen as a “ban on bitcoin”.\nApart from this, the RBI has issued several warnings about scams and risks related to crypto currencies. It had also said there would be a crackdown on the illegal use of such cryptos.\nBut traders are still buying and selling crypto currencies under a three-month notice period that was issued to all exchanges. Even after that, the RBI or the government cannot technically ban bitcoin. Also, in the latest event, the Delhi High Court has already challenged this circular calling it “unconstitutional” and the apex bank has to present the basis of this restriction on banks to the court.\nPractical implications\nOther countries like China and the US have already tried banning exchanges, ICOs and mining of crypto currencies. Although those events in 2017 caused the price of bitcoin to fall temporarily, it went on to peak at $19,783 on December 17.\nSince most of the trading happens on international exchanges, banning Indian bourses will only make Indians buy crypto currencies from foreign sources or OTC (over the counter) options because it is simply not possible to track buying, trading or selling of crypto currencies.\nBans in other countries like Japan have also resulted in exchanges moving base to countries with friendlier macro environments like Malta and Estonia. This has only resulted in loss in terms of taxes for the governments of hostile countries.\nFor everyone who is holding any coins, they would transfer it to a wallet or an international exchange and then sell it for USD and convert USD to INR. This just hurts India because we will not even be able to tax this income if this is done in cash. Also, such a scenario exists only until the time enthusiasts can’t buy much with crypto currency.\nBut there are sites that are already accepting crypto currency as a mode of payment. As more tokens emerge and have real usage, it will be difficult to keep them at bay.\nWith bitcoin, we have seen the Streisand Effect in play – which means the more governments try to ban it, the more popular it gets, the more news, the more coverage.\nRegulation\nThe only way to go about this saga is regulation, where checks are in place to ensure customers aren’t duped, taxation on profits and an era where exchanges follow KYC norms and legal compliances are in place. That would make it much safer for Indian citizens to buy, trade and profit from this revolution and be educated about its risks.\nIn February 2018, the US government has called for inter-departmental cooperation and allocated resources with the aim to create new legislation to govern virtual currencies.\nThere is also an opportunity for our country to become the Switzerland of the next century. If one government were to reduce taxes from trading of crypto currencies, the amount of crypto money to come in that country would be mind-boggling.\nThis may seem like a pipedream, but Malta is already going down this path and attracting major Blockchain players, including the largest international exchange at this time with profits of more than 200 million USD – more than profits of many traditional banks.\nEvery government wants to ban it because it undermines the power of Fiat currency – US dollar, Indian rupee and the like. But every government has tried and failed and in 2018, it is accepted that there will be regulation rather than bans.\nThe point of creating bitcoin\nA lot of believers of bitcoin see it as a way to liberate ourselves from the control of governments and the financial system. The point is to eliminate the need for printing money and more importantly, banks. So, banks moving out of the equation is a cause for celebration in the community rather than seen as a bad thing.\nAs countries grapple with regulation and laws, the crypto currency market cap keeps soaring every year. As they say, nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\n(Pareen is a blockchain and crypto currency writer.

It’s a rather innovative way at approaching investor education in the brave new world of cryptocurrency.\nAlso read: Federal Reserve Pres: People Want Dollar, Not Volatile Crypto\nSEC Posts ICO Scam Site\n“Combining the two most growth-oriented segments of the digital economy,” the mock SEC website reads, “blockchain technology and travel, Howeycoin is the newest and only coin offering that captures the magic of coin trading profits AND the excitement and guaranteed returns of the travel industry. Howeycoins will partner with all segments of the travel industry (air, hotel, car rental, and luxury segments), earning coins you can trade for profit instead of points.”\nIt really is a novel idea. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained , “The rapid growth of the ‘ICO’ market, and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity, has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors. We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud. Distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions.”\nAnd it is also more than ironic how “on it” the SEC has been when it comes to crypto and all things ICO. Enforcement subpoenas are flying all around the United States in search of the next conviction. Ironic, because, of course, so little, comparatively, has been done similarly with regard to mainstream financial scams: The Great Recession is probably a perfect example. Crypto, while often ‘poo-poo’d’ as largely irrelevant and no threat, does appear to occupy more and more time and space in SEC moves.\nNevertheless, SEC Chief Counsel, Owen Donley, detailed how fraudsters “can quickly build an attractive website and load it up with convoluted jargon to lure investors into a phony deal. But fraudulent sites also often have red flags that can be dead giveaways if you know what to look for.” The webpage www.howeycoins.com is an in-house SEC project they were able to construct in relatively little time. Howey is derived from the landmark 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. Its decision guides the definition the regulator uses to this day in determining what constitutes a security: “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”\nPretty Much Spot On\nSome of the better lines are eerily spot on. “We anticipate OVER 1% daily returns, with DOUBLE 2% returns on Tier 1 investors in pre-ICO stage secured purchases,” Howeycoin promises. “The average registered coin return over a two month period in 2017 was an amazing 72%. Based on market conditions, including record-setting prospects in both the digital asset and travel industries, we expect to surpass that BEFORE the Tier 2 offering closes. HODL! We also forecast a minimum growth rate of between 7% to 15% annualized, making Howeycoins attractive for long-term investment. In addition, Howeycoins can serve as a GUARANTEED hedge against inflation and market loss.”\nClicking on the live links brings surfers to a reveal landing page: “If You Responded To An Investment Offer Like This, You Could Have Been Scammed – Howeycoins Are Completely Fake!” the banner blares.

As it stands now, consumers can use Bitcoin across a number of industries to purchase everything from real estate, to PCs, to pizza. However, Bitcoin’s high transaction costs, deflationary nature, and full transparency represent some of the shortcomings that prevent Bitcoin from seeing widespread merchant adoption.\nAs such, enthusiasts, consumers, and producers alike have gotten behind a number of altcoins as mediums of exchange for a variety of uses. While Bitcoin acted as the catalyst for the first wave of crypto-merchant integration, these emerging altcoins are the pioneers for the interactions between the consumers and merchants of tomorrow. Privacy Coins\nOne cryptocurrency niche seeing steady and increasing consumer activity is privacy coins. There exist a number of situations where anonymous transactions are optimal for the consumer or producer. The obvious example is the use of Monero (XMR) to power darknet markets – allowing buyers and sellers to agree upon the sale of drugs and other illicit goods in a completely anonymous, untraceable manner.\nHowever, black market sales do not wholly represent usage of privacy coins. Consumers have also flocked to privacy coins for usage in the adult industry . Monero has seen integration on sites selling sex toys. A number of privacy coins have also been integrated across various porn sites. With privacy coins, there is no paper trail – alleviating the risk of embarrassing or scandalous credit card statements being viewed by other parties. The nature of cryptocurrency also ensures that payments to any merchant will not jeopardize the information or payment details of the consumer.\nOf course, the recent Verge partnership represents the most prominent instance of adoption of privacy coins in the adult industry. Last month, Verge (XVG) unveiled a partnership with porn giant Pornhub.com , which will allow payments to the site to be made via XVG. Although much controversy has ensued, this partnership pins Verge as a pioneer for privacy coin adoption. Other Instances\nOutside of privacy coins, a number of other altcoins have also begun to see meaningful integrations. OmiseGo (OMG), a platform seeking to empower the unbanked and create an inclusive, massively scalable financial ecosystem, earned the spotlight when OMG was integrated by McDonald’s Thailand. As OmiseGo continues to expand its network, it’s predicted that other large corporations will integrate the cryptocurrency down the road.\nBeloved meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has also seen significant adoption. As the lighthearted and far-reaching community drove the joke coin to a powerhouse with a market cap of over US$500 million, community members and converted fans have driven Doge to be picked up by numerous merchants worldwide. One example that encapsulates the spirit of DOGE is this site for trendy pet accessories.\nOne upcoming project with a lot of potential is flogmall . Flogmall seeks to become a one-stop online shopping destination that accepts all cryptocurrencies. Of course, this will include KickCoin (KICK), the native token of the platform that’s responsible for crowdfunding the flogmall project, KICKICO.\nOf course, with the ever-increasing popularity and information surrounding cryptocurrency, it’s only logical that merchants and consumers worldwide will continue to make new transactions and relationships through cryptocurrency. The future of cryptocurrency in consumer settings is wildly exciting.\nFull details at themerkle.com/forget-bitcoin-these-altcoins-are-leading-the-way-in-merchant-adoption/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "these altcoins are leading the way", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:22:53.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b21d9f0b43af52c6dbceffb3e5bb43dadd91099a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDasPIzOwc7q6yDP8D35x.wEJaw13iauqaVL1RRKBCeqXG0xmgWUTFQzX6YNqul.ZAw8Hf6jlT7AiQmsyz9m0YsWG7O.qfvf2EAM4kn5v1ef17A--", "site_full": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Central Bank Digital Currency?

Circle now joins Coinbase as one of the most well-funded cryptocurrency companies in the U.S., and the Boston-based firm has announced plans to issue a dollar-backed cryptocurrency called USD-C.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nCircle Raises $110Mn — Plans to Launch Stablecoin\nCircle has big plans ahead for its latest mobile project called ‘Centre’ while also revealing its plans to create a stable coin much like the currency Tether (USDT). Furthermore, the firm has raised $110Mn in a Series E funding round that included investors such as Bitmain Technologies, Blockchain Capital, Pantera, Digital Currency Group and other venture firms. In addition to the injection of capital, Circle says it is planning to launch a new cryptocurrency that is backed by the price and reserves of USD.\nThe company’s new token will be called ‘USD-C’ and based off of the Ethereum network. According to the Circle, the firm’s subsidiary ‘Centre’ project will manage the USD-C protocol. Circle feels a cryptocurrency that is tied to a fiat currency can add more value to the blockchain ecosystem.\n“It is difficult to use something like bitcoin if the volatility is so high,” Circle’s founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire explains. “Something like this makes it more possible.”\nA Partnership With Bitmain\nCircle also detailed that Bitmain will also be helping with the Centre project and the USD-C launch. “Bitmain will help Centre introduce multiple fiat stablecoins in a variety of geo-currency zones,” the company explains. Moreover, the company takes a jab at other ‘stablecoins’ utilized in the markets right now that lack transparency as the firm states :\nExisting fiat-backed approaches have lacked financial and operational transparency, have operated in unregulated jurisdictions with unknown banking and audit partners, and have been built as closed-loop ecosystems and closed proprietary technologies.\nCircle says despite celebrating their fifth anniversary this fall they feel like they are just getting started. In addition to Centre and the new USD-C token that will launch this summer, Circle says it also has plans for Circle Invest, Circle Trade, Circle Pay, and the newly acquired Poloniex exchange.\n“We see the future of the global economy as open, shared, inclusive, distributed, and powerful — not only for a few chosen gatekeepers, but for all who will connect,” Circle adds.\nWhat do you think about Circle raising $110Mn in a funding round led by Bitmain? What do you think about this new USD-C idea they have?

ET CONTRIBUTORS | Updated: May 16, 2018, 05.50 PM IST 0 Comments If you read the RBI circular, they have never used the words \"ban\" pertaining to bitcoins. By Pareen Lathia Every few months, we hear that bitcoin has been banned by some country or the other. As early as 2013, bitcoin was \"banned\" by Thailand. In 2017, it was big news when China banned bitcoin and the latest news carries a ban by the Reserve Bank of India . The problem is this news is grossly misleading because it is simply not possible to ban bitcoin, or any crypto currency for that matter. Bitcoin’s price last year was hovering around $1,000 mark whereas right now, it is in the $9,000 range. This is in spite of the all the bans. This does not fit into any market logic. But that is the beauty of crypto currencies. They do not fit into traditional regulatory or banking framework. A different outlook is needed to understand how they work and why they were created in the first place. Decentralisation This is because bitcoin and most crypto currencies that run on Blockchain technology are decentralised. It means they do not run on one server or URL or IP address. These virtual currencies run on multiple nodes that can be owned and run by anyone and are usually spread across the globe. There is no central point for the governments to attack or block. This is very similar to Torrent protocol. It is peer-to-peer. At the simplest level, if I hold bitcoin in my wallet and transfer it to your wallet, there is no way any government can block it because this entry of transfer is recorded in a distributed ledger. What has RBI done? So, what is this ban? If you read the RBI circular, they have never used the words \"ban\" pertaining to bitcoins. It has only prevented any organisation regulated by the central bank to deal with businesses that have anything to do with crypto currencies. Practically, this means banks will have to stop deposits and withdrawals to and from Indian rupee on crypto currency exchanges. This news spread widely and was seen as a “ban on bitcoin”. Apart from this, the RBI has issued several warnings about scams and risks related to crypto currencies. It had also said there would be a crackdown on the illegal use of such cryptos. But traders are still buying and selling crypto currencies under a three-month notice period that was issued to all exchanges. Even after that, the RBI or the government cannot technically ban bitcoin. Also, in the latest event, the Delhi High Court has already challenged this circular calling it “unconstitutional” and the apex bank has to present the basis of this restriction on banks to the court. Practical implications Other countries like China and the US have already tried banning exchanges, ICOs and mining of crypto currencies. Although those events in 2017 caused the price of bitcoin to fall temporarily, it went on to peak at $19,783 on December 17. Since most of the trading happens on international exchanges, banning Indian bourses will only make Indians buy crypto currencies from foreign sources or OTC (over the counter) options because it is simply not possible to track buying, trading or selling of crypto currencies. Bans in other countries like Japan have also resulted in exchanges moving base to countries with friendlier macro environments like Malta and Estonia. This has only resulted in loss in terms of taxes for the governments of hostile countries. For everyone who is holding any coins, they would transfer it to a wallet or an international exchange and then sell it for USD and convert USD to INR. This just hurts India because we will not even be able to tax this income if this is done in cash. Also, such a scenario exists only until the time enthusiasts can’t buy much with crypto currency. But there are sites that are already accepting crypto currency as a mode of payment. As more tokens emerge and have real usage, it will be difficult to keep them at bay. With bitcoin, we have seen the Streisand Effect in play – which means the more governments try to ban it, the more popular it gets, the more news, the more coverage. Regulation The only way to go about this saga is regulation, where checks are in place to ensure customers aren’t duped, taxation on profits and an era where exchanges follow KYC norms and legal compliances are in place. That would make it much safer for Indian citizens to buy, trade and profit from this revolution and be educated about its risks. In February 2018, the US government has called for inter-departmental cooperation and allocated resources with the aim to create new legislation to govern virtual currencies. There is also an opportunity for our country to become the Switzerland of the next century. If one government were to reduce taxes from trading of crypto currencies, the amount of crypto money to come in that country would be mind-boggling. This may seem like a pipedream, but Malta is already going down this path and attracting major Blockchain players, including the largest international exchange at this time with profits of more than 200 million USD – more than profits of many traditional banks. Every government wants to ban it because it undermines the power of Fiat currency – US dollar, Indian rupee and the like. But every government has tried and failed and in 2018, it is accepted that there will be regulation rather than bans. The point of creating bitcoin A lot of believers of bitcoin see it as a way to liberate ourselves from the control of governments and the financial system. The point is to eliminate the need for printing money and more importantly, banks. So, banks moving out of the equation is a cause for celebration in the community rather than seen as a bad thing. As countries grapple with regulation and laws, the crypto currency market cap keeps soaring every year. As they say, nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.

How to Use Social Media to Dominate Google's Search Results | Ep. #646 In episode #646, Eric and Neil discuss how you can use social media to dominate Google’s search results. Tune in to hear how you can leverage social media to rank higher in Google. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Use Social Media to Dominate Google's Search Results [00:40] You have to create a lot of content. [00:50] You can use social media to rank for your brand, but also for a lot of other keywords or terms. [00:56] If you search for anything, Google will also bring up Twitter results. [01:30] By participating in all social media sites, you can show up for everything! [01:45] Eric helped an alarm company push up the results for their social profiles and buried their one negative Forbes review. [02:35] Link to your social profiles from your website. [02:52] The domain authority to these sites is so high already, that Google will push the results higher. [03:08] Participate actively on social media. [03:24] Make sure you engage other users on social media. [03:48] Listen to Eric and Neil’s episode about getting your social media profiles up and running/link building. [04:00] Make sure you cross-promote your social profiles once per month. [04:20] Get personal: social is meant to be about you. Talk about your team instead of the product.

Tune in to hear what will become of SEO next year and how you can adapt. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: [00:38] SEO is heading towards voice search. [00:40] However, it’s not just SEO, it’s the world. Consider Amazon’s “Alexa”. [01:03] Search is changing, because people will ask an AI assistant as opposed to Googling. [01:56] There is a tool that was developed to help with semantic searches. [02:08] It looks for the meaning of what you are looking for (ex. What is love? And it will produce results that offer resources to answer that question). [02:50] AI and semantic searches are melding together. [03:09] Alexa the product is better at SEO, but the voice device outranks it. [03:25] Mobile is huge now. [03:33] If you are using a mobile phone, the search index you see is different than what you would get on a desktop. [03:50] It’s unclear how to monetize voice search thus far. [04:04] You need to be there, so once it’s monetized, you can jump on it. [04:46] Eric and Neil now have their podcast on Alexa and they are getting more listens. [05:20] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear why and how you should diversify your efforts. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: You Should Never Rely on SEO or Social Media Marketing [00:35] With social media sites, you are never in full control of your own destiny and you never want to put that in someone else’s hands. [01:00] Paid ads are great, but costs can go up or you can get banned. [01:26] Leverage SEO and Social, but you also need to diversify into things like paid advertising, email marketing, etc. [02:04] Be patient, get ONE thing working before you diversify. [02:47] When relying on social media channels, take your profits and diversify as quickly as possible. [03:05] Spend the money earlier on. [03:20] Once you have that multi-channel approach, make sure you are creating really high quality content. [04:00] Slow and steady wins the race with SEO. [04:11] It takes time and money to create great content. [04:44] Going for short-term hacks will screw you in the long run. [05:14] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear which marketing tools are free or low cost and still get the job done. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Best Marketing Tools For Under $100 [00:33] Eric likes BuzzSumo, because it lets you track your brand, certain keywords, and traffic coming into your site. [00:56] Neil likes SpyFu. It’s not as popular as SEMrush and AHREFS, but it’s a lot less expensive and has a lot of good data. You get similar results, so if you can’t afford the other services, this is a great option. [01:16] Wistia has a good free version you can use to make and post videos. [01:50] Sumo is a great way to collect emails and remarket to people. It’s an all-in-one free tool. [02:18] Frame.io streamlines the video-making process. It may run you over $100/year. [02:42] Survey Monkey is a great tool to help you get feedback from your customers; this is a way to qualitative data. [03:14] For heat mapping, Crazy Egg can’t be beat. [03:26] Convert Kit is for email blasts. While it doesn’t have full automation, it’s a useful and easy-to-use tool for marketers. [04:29] You don’t have to pay for these tools every month. Sometimes, you can use the free option and always upgrade for a month at a time. [04:40] That’s it for today! [04:50] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear which social network you should be leveraging and what tactics you need to use. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Social Network That'll Drive You More Traffic Than Facebook [00:36] The social network that will get you more traffic than Facebook is LinkedIn! [00:45] It’s not popular, but it works better. [01:05] After the Microsoft acquisition, LinkedIn has stepped up their game. [01:14] When you post on LinkedIn, the post stays up longer and you get more engagement. [01:27] Facebook can do whatever they want, while LinkedIn is starving for content and needs to compete. [02:02] If you want organic traffic, use LinkedIn. [02:12] When Neil posts a video on LinkedIn, he gets anywhere from twice to seven times as many views as he would on Facebook. [03:03] To succeed on LinkedIn: take your video content and put it on LinkedIn. [03:11] To succeed on LinkedIn: Take the audio from your video content, turn it into a podcast and post on LinkedIn. [03:33] To succeed on LinkedIn: Post your blog posts on LinkedIn. [03:45] However, with blog posts you should put the title, first two paragraphs, and then a link to your site for the rest. [04:01] Engage with other groups and members. [04:16] That’s it for today! [04:20] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear how you can increase your traffic and conversions. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Simplest Way to Bring People Back to Your Website [00:55] You either collect emails or get them to opt into push notifications. Then you have to continually urge them back to your site. [01:10] You can also get people to follow your social profiles, but they don’t convert. [02:00] Subscribers is a great email service, but you can also use ManyChat to push people back to your site. [02:40] Try retargeting, as well. Google Retargeting and you will probably come across Neil. [03:07] It is just putting a pixel on your site that alerts ad networks and lets them track visitors. This will then allow ad networks to spot your visitors and post relevant ads in their browser that will send them back to your site. [03:20] However, retargeting is expensive. [03:27] Neil agrees that email is a great technique and likes Mobile Monkey. [03:45] It’s harder to get traffic from Facebook ads now, so you should leverage sure things like email and chatbot marketing. [03:53] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear what one tactic you should be leveraging. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Marketing Tactic You Must Master in 2018 [00:33] Surprise: it’s branding! [00:49] Neil recently performed a survey to discover what causes people to engage with his brand. [00:57] He made sure it was an open-ended survey. [01:05] The answers were either that they saw him at a conference or watched his videos. [01:55] The reason Eric and Neil simulcast their podcasts on video is because people enjoy and engage with the videos more. [02:14] Even though it costs more upfront, it will pay off financially in the long run. [03:00] The market is very fragmented right now; the way people market and engage with content varies. [03:38] Make sure that you spread your content across the many different social media platforms, because you will reach different people on each one. [04:35] There are a lot of websites that get a lot of traffic, but bring in little revenue; so, Neil’s company has been buying them out in order to pick up the traffic. [05:10] That’s it for today!

TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Three Best Marketing Strategies [00:46] Posting less on Facebook, actually gets you more traffic. [01:14] Share your best pieces and you will get higher engagement. [01:40] Eric’s office has printed out and posted the Content Re-usage Workflow. [02:00] The framework says to start with a foundation, which will then give you options to spin the content down the line. [02:54] Google Analytics can now show you each person’s entrypoint to your site and what is causing a conversion. [03:05] Take the conversion data and take the low click-rate stuff and repurpose it.

Tune in to hear how many different facets go into creating a successful business. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Small Things Make The Biggest Difference [00:36] At a past job, Eric took the footer links on the homepage and added more that said “Learn Web Design” and “Learn Web Development”. These small changes helped to improve the domain authority. [01:23] The Dropbox referral program isn’t what made their company, even though it helped. [01:35] Their explainer video was also a small thing that helped make a difference without making the only difference. [02:00] Dropbox offered a lot of little things to help create the powerhouse they are today. [02:15] It’s never just one thing, but rather a lot of little things that make up a successful company. [02:45] It’s like a video game: you are constantly leveling up. [03:38] Think about building things up, but remember not to do it in isolation. [04:00] Figure out how you can do one small marketing thing each and every week. [04:05] Even though you won't’ necessarily see the results every week, it will pay off in the near future. [04:20] When Eric started at Single Grain, the web traffic was 4000/month. Now, it is 100,000+/month. [04:30] This improvement was made over the course of four years. [04:41] Never expect immediate results. [05:16] Eric remembers grinding away until he got results. [05:44] It’s all about the journey! [06:06] For the first year that Eric was podcasting Growth Everywhere, he would spend six hours putting together all the facets of creating and uploading an episode. [06:17] He only got 9 downloads per day, but kept grinding away until he got more listeners. [06:30] Now, they get 80,000 listeners. [06:44] There was no one thing that made the podcast big, it was a combination of factors. [06:48] That’s all for today! [06:49] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear why you should be focused more energy on paid ads. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: SEO Will Never be as Good as Paid Ads! [00:34] Content pages generally rank higher than product pages. [00:59] While paid ads are expensive, you can direct traffic to pages that will generate the most cash. [01:10] The conversion rate is higher, because visitors will land on a page that is selling them something. [01:29] You just can’t control SEO as well as you can paid ads. [01:57] With paid ads, you can scale as much as you need to. [02:20] VC’s really like pouring money into SaaS companies. [02:44] Google and Facebook wouldn’t be worth what they are, if it wasn’t for paid ads. [03:30] People are moving campaigns from TV to the Internet. [04:05] Focus on paid ads before SEO, especially if you have a product or service. [04:34] That’s it for today! [04:37] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Connect with us: NeilPatel.com Quick Sprout Growth Everywhere Single Grain Twitter @neilpatel Twitter @ericosiu Is It Worth Spending $200 Per Blog Post? | Ep. #636 In episode #636, Eric and Neil discuss whether it is worth spending money on blog posts. Tune in to hear where your money should be going. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Is It Worth Spending $200 Per Blog Post? [00:33] Yes, it is worth the money! [00:45] The cost per blog depends on the industry. [00:50] It’s not about how much you pay, but rather if it is on the right topic, using the right keywords, etc. [01:05] You can’t be pushing or schilling in the post, it needs to educate. [01;20] Neil writes long-form blog posts. [01:40] It costs him well over $200 per blog post. [02:05] Start with a strong foundation and build from there (videos, webinars, facebook ads). [02:23] Singlegrain went from 4000 visitors per month to over 100,000 by using this strategy. [03:15] Every quarter, open up a tool like AHREFS, see the keywords for which you rank well and improve upon them or replicate that content. [04:01] Once you build a strong blog foundation, you can expand into other areas of media. However, don’t neglect your blog posts as a result. [04:15] You will get higher ROI by fixing up old content. [04:42] Clickflow is a tool to help you figure all this out. [04:58] If you spend money on a post, remember that it keeps generating traffic each and every month. [05:18] Google “Tom Tunguz and compound marketing” and you will get a great blog post about this very subject. [05:41] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear what you may have been overlooking. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: 95% of You Will Ignore This SEO Strategy [00:36] Branding is what separates good companies from the bad. [01:30] If you don’t know how popular a brand is, it’s hard to outrank them. [02:00] Neil’s strategy used to be: create good content, create value, wait for results. [02:04] This wasn’t the best strategy. [02:15] His best branding strategy was the “Who is Neil Patel?” campaign. [02:45] BuzzSumo has a great alert system that will help you track your brand. [02:51] Neil likes to use Google Trends, which is free. [03:03] Google Search Console is also a great way to track your progress. [03:10] GSC tracks farther back than 90 days, which is more helpful when gauging progress. [04:15] The stronger your brand, the higher your domain authority. [04:40] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear why experiments are key. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: The Straightest Road to Success [00:33] The key to success is experimentation! [00:51] A lot of people forget to build out an experimentation framework. [01:02] Neil will split his team into four groups and each group will submit ideas each week for “crazy” experiments they can run. [02:38] Each group needs to run experiments every week. [02:46] GrowthHackers created North Star, which helps you track experiments over time. [03:00] Northstar is a free service. [03:18] Try Google Experiments as another tracker. [03:34] Build experimentation into the fabric of your company. [04:00] It’s ok if experiments fail! [04:28] By doing radical experiments, you can learn how to grow your company at a fast pace.

Tune in to hear what you should love in order to be successful. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Don't Fall in Love With an Idea [00:35] Most startups start with a totally different idea than what they are doing presently. [00:54] Don’t fall in love with an idea, fall in love with an industry. [01:55] As long as you stick with your industry, you can build upon that experience, as opposed to shifting to something else entirely. [02:18] It’s like compound interest: the moment you stop investing, you lose all that interest. [02:53] Stay in your lane. [03:01] In a Nathan Latka podcast interview, the discussion was about sticking with one industry instead of branching out into the unknown. [04:02] You need to love what you do, but make sure you love the industry. [04:20] Elon Musk had ZipTo, then Paypal, then SpaceX. Because he jumped industries, he struggled much longer before his success. [05:23] It’s like WOW: you need to keep levelling up. [06:00] That’s all for today!

Tune in to see why past techniques may not work for you today. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Stop Copying Your Competition [00:38] What worked for your competition won’t necessarily work for you. [01:17] The problem with content marketing is that there is now a lot more competition. [01:40] Whereas Neil had success within the first three months, it would take people a year to do the same today. [02:18] Costs of paid ads have gone up and bigger brands drive prices even higher. [03:00] What people were willing to spend years ago, was a lot less than you would have to spend today. [04:00] Just because one tactic worked for another company, doesn’t mean it will work the same way for you. [04:15] Dropbox referral programs worked in the past, but they probably wouldn’t work now. [04:50] If you’re in business to make money, you should do something else. [05:03] You have to be three steps ahead of everyone; think about what will be popular in the future. Spot trends.

Tune in to hear why overthinking could be ruining your business. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Don't Overthink Shit [00:34] Everyone loves to come up with complex funnels. [00:48] When you make it complex, stuff is more likely to break down. [01:12] Start simple, then expand. [01:22] When Eric started, his channel was SEO. They wrote content and did a lot of guest posting. [01:43] They tried a complex marketing funnel, but it didn’t work. [01:55] They also were podcasting at the same time and then layered in content marketing once they got the hang of everything. [02:27] Just focus on the things that you are good at. [02:40] Don’t take on too much and you can layer things in later. [03:14] Why build a crazy marketing/sales funnel, when you haven’t tried a simple one in order to see if it would even work? [03:50] The boring growth is often the most sustainable growth. [05:06] Wait until the next marketing method has been effective and monetized by others, then jump on the bandwagon. You don’t have to be the first! [05:33] That’s all for today! [05:36] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway! Leave some feedback: What should we talk about next?

Tune in to hear what you should be doing to become a more successful marketer. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How Successful Marketers Think [00:35] Successful marketers are numb to failure. [00:45] Most experiments are going to fail, but as long as you continue to improve by 1%/week, that will be a 50% gain over the course of a year. [01:13] Consistency is key! [01:20] It takes time to get things right, but you have to stay the course. [01:45] Eric writes thousands of blog posts, even though he has terrible grammar. He knows it is important to follow through and be consistent. [01:50] Be a T-shaped marketer. [02:30] Spot trends! If you are not good at spotting trends, keep reading news sites and stay on top of things. [03:25] Things change so quickly in marketing. [04:45] If you are not thinking about ROI, you are not going to succeed in the marketing world. [05:20] It’s important to be data-driven; the numbers do not lie. [05:59] Don’t be afraid to shake up whatever industry you are in. [06:12] Neil is willing to do this by taking competitors products or services, copying them, and then offering them for free.

Tune in to hear what’s changed and how you can get a successful start doing SEO. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Start in SEO [00:45] The biggest thing that Eric and Neil are seeing right now is that the path to success has changed. [01:18] If you spend a year practicing SEO on your own website, that’s no longer the way to go. [01:35] You should practice on someone else’s older website. [01:52] Hit up a ton of people offering your services for free. [02:00] It’s easier to grow a business than it is to start one. [02:25] During a TED Talk Eric saw, a Harvard Professor outlined the three elements of trust: authenticity, empathy, and logic. [02:45] When you develop your skills for free, you will eventually earn clients. [03:14] You will probably have to email 15-17 people before you get a solid “yes” when it comes to offering your services for free. [03:40] Make sure that the person to whom you offer your services is as committed as you are. [03:59] Even if you are working for free, make sure you get a contract to get the time that you need. [04:38] A semantic search tool was just released from a developer at Google. [04:57] Be aware that this is the future of searching and it will affect your SEO. [05:42] SEO and Sales are similar. [05:58] SEO is trying to sell yourself and get a link. [06:04] Victor Antonio has a great YouTube page about sales. [06:24] Most new SEO workers focus on traffic from relevant keywords, which Neil thinks is a terrible idea. [06:37] Just because you get more relevant traffic, doesn’t mean you get more sales. [06:50] Instead, look at Google Analytics, see where your ROI is coming from, focus on increasing traffic to the landing pages with the most revenue. [07:21] That’s it for today!

Tune in to hear why you should always focus on long-term goals and solutions. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: 6 Minutes For the Next 60 Years of Your Entrepreneurial Journey [00:36] When you think about starting a business, most people think about “what problem should I solve?” [00:54] But you should also ask “will this problem that I’m solving still be relevant in the ensuing years?” [01:08] You don’t want to have to create a new business every few years. [01:30] Eric thinks Singlegrain will still be around in 20 years, but that it will have to evolve. [02:10] Five years into his business, Eric believes he still has a long way to go. [02:36] If you come up with a short-sighted solution, then you will have to start a new business every few years. It is easier to grow a business than it is to start one. [03:00] Elon Musk has a long-term plan to work towards getting people on Mars. [04:07] Often times, the most difficult problems to solve are also the most boring, but the boring stuff stands the test of time. [05:00] Neil believes marketing will always be around as a industry. [05:45] Focus on your strengths and then see how you can expand upon that. [06:10] Do the boring stuff! [06:36] Don’t focus on the short-term solutions or businesses. [06:53] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear what you should be doing to grab your next successful CMO. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Find a CMO [00:33] They get hit up all the time for people looking to fill this position, but it is the hardest position to fill. [00:55] Tap into referral networks. [01:05] When Eric was hired at Treehouse, he was referred in. [01:27] Don’t just hire a CMO, have someone prove in a lesser position that they can deliver results for you. Have people work their way up. [02:55] Instead of having a CMO, just make the marketing department work together to guide the mission. [03:41] Contingency firms whose focus is on hiring executives is another way to go. [03:48] They will cost you a lot of money, but will deliver on the mission. [04:34] Org structures are different now, so it changes how you can operate. [04:38] To recap: referral networks work, contingency firms work, having NO CMO works. [04:48] That’s it for today! [04:50] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Tune in to hear what you should actually be focusing on! TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: To Focus or Not to Focus, The Marketer's Dilemma [00:50] People have different concepts of how marketing works. [01:02] Your tactics all depend on what your business is, what its status is, etc. [01:37] Pick a tactic that is working the best for you and focus all your energy on that. [01:55] Once that tactic is operating to its best abilities, add in other tactics. [02:24] Eric worked at a company that tried a bunch of different tactics and found video marketing worked the best, then focused all their energy on that. [03:14] Neil met the Legal Zoom/Shoedazzle CEO; he told Neil to have laser focus. [04:10] Steve Jobs said that he is better at saying “no” than other people. [04:40] If your growth rate is accelerating, hit the gas. If it’s decelerating, think about what you can improve. [04:55] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear why television news is a waste of your time. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Why We Don't Watch The News [00:33] The news media is just another business. [00:45] It’s a viewership-driven business and they thrive on ad revenue. [01:00] Instead, Eric follows different people on Twitter and gets his news from that. [01:20] TV news is just noise! [02:21] You can get your news by browsing news sites instead. [02:34] If something really important or big happens, you will most likely find out about it on Twitter or social media, anyway. [03:15] By not spending time posting on social media, you gain a lot of hours back. [03:44] To beat your competition, focus on your business and what matters as opposed to being obsessed with frivolous social media posts. [04:40] The Economist Espresso is one or two paragraphs and summarizes the most important stories. [05:00] “If you want to do well, stop wasting your time” -Neil [05:07] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear how you should be organizing your life. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Get More Out of Your Day [00:40] Google “Michael Hyatt Perfect Day”, which will explain how to block out your day. [00:53] Eric and Neil record at a set time every week. [01:07] Thursdays are Eric’s content days. Fridays are for his SAS products. [02:05] Eric will do networking events, dinners, etc., because it is a priority for growing his business. [02:40] Figure out your end goal and cut everything else out. [03:00] Neil doesn’t do networking events, rather he does actual tasks. [03:15] He feels that if he hasn’t accomplished his goals, he can’t rest, so he doesn’t care about work/life balance: he works through illnesses and holidays. [03:29] Mark Schuster did a blog post “Learning Before Earning”, which you should read. [04:09] The book, The One Thing, tells you to pick your most important goal and to just focus on that. [05:06] Building or fostering good habits is key. [05:15] You have to rank things to determine which is the most urgent/important. [05:42] Check out Rescue Time: It will show you how you are spending your time and allow you to cut the fat. [06:15] Delegate! [07:10] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear what you should be doing to remain popular. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Here's A Unique Way To Keep Your Brand Top Of Mind [00:38] If you look at Drift, every time they launch a new feature, they always have a lot of fanfare and masquerade it as a product launch. [01:26] In 2017, Neil bought UberSuggest and relaunched it as a free tool in 2018. [01:45] He used Product Hunt to promote it. [02:15] Neil publishes to his blog 7 days a week! [02:32] You have to be relentless in order to stay top of mind. Tom Brady is a great example of relentlessness. [03:00] There is no one specific thing you can do to stay popular, but rather you have to try everything. [03:42] The rule of 7: someone has to see something 7 times before they convert. [04:10] By putting yourself out there, eventually, you will become top of mind. [04:51] Zoom doesn’t run a lot of ads, but they have billboards everywhere in San Francisco. They even bought a sponsorship at the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. [05:28] That’s all for today! [05:31] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Running Out of Marketing Ideas? Do this [00:45] Eric opens Feedly, which has a bunch of marketing blogs, which can give him a bunch of ideas. [01:17] Nuzzle takes all of his Twitter followers and shows him who they are following. [01:34] Basically, go out and research in order to get new ideas. [01:47] Instead of doing more things, improve what you are already doing. [01:53] Try using Buzzsumo, SEMRush, AHREFS in order to see what your competitors are doing. [02:14] Re-write your competitors work and improve upon it. [02:46] Whatrunswhere shows you what banner ads your competitors are leveraging. [03:15] Keep things fresh: go look at your channels and update/upgrade them. [03:42] Crowdsource your ideas! [04:50] Listen to competitors’ podcasts, which will give you great ideas. Find out their numbers, see what’s working, and leverage this information to your advantage. [05:32] Eric did an episode of Growth Everywhere and his interviewee’s competitor was listening and reached out to Eric.

Tune in to hear how you can decipher a bullshitter from a talented marketer. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Marketers Are Full of Shit [00:34] Marketers always talk a big game, but their results speak for themselves. [01:08] When hiring marketers, make sure whatever they claim to have done is backed up by proof. [01:45] Eric’s friend had to fire his marketing guy, because the marketer used up too many resources. [02:16] You must absolutely require proof of success and pay them for a trial period (run a series of paid tests). [02:48] Always test out a working relationship before you pull the trigger. [03:20] Neil doesn’t care what your title is, he is only focused on efficacy and results. [03:43] Eric and Neil can easily provide proof of their results. [04:05] “What is the most impressive win of your marketing career thus far?” is Eric’s favorite interview question. Once you start pressing for details, you can tell whether a candidate is lying. [04:40] Neil likes to show candidates his website and ask what they would do to fix any issues. [05:05] This is a great way to see if they can think on their feet or improve upon anything. It shows you if they know what they are talking about. [05:41] That’s all for today! [05:43] Go to Singlegrain.com/Giveway for a special marketing tool giveaway!

Eric and Neil discuss 7 unorthodox marketing hacks. Tune in to hear what you could be doing to drive conversions. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: 7 Unorthodox Marketing Hacks You Ought to Leverage [00:35] #1: When driving people to your website, less than 5% will convert. For the 95% that don’t convert, re-market them with an opposite pitch (logical vs. emotional). [01:22] #2: Every month, when Drift launches a new feature, they treat it as a product launch, which helps to keep them top-of-mind. Product Hunt is a great tool for this. [02:22] #3: There is a program on LinkedIn that gives a special button that populates their LinkedIn info into a form, so they have less work to do. This will increase your leads and conversions, because there is less work to be done [02:59] #4: Build a repurposing framework. Think about all the content you can take even further (turning a blog post into a video, social media post, webinar, etc.). [03:36] #5: To increase your traffic, start doing things people wouldn’t normally do. [04:01] The best way to get people from your blog to your landing page/product page is to place banner ads within your blog. [04:27] #6: Offer something for free for the cost of shipping. [04:57] Russell Brunson built his company by doing this. [05:10] #7: Give people options in your ads. [05:22] Within the first 30 seconds of a video about learning guitar, the instructor offered a link for beginners and a link for more advanced students. [06:04] That’s it for today!

TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Audit Your Content in 5 Minutes [00:34] Eric likes to use Screaming Frog Spider, an SEO tool that allows him to crawl his website like a search engine would. [01:06] There’s an annual fee, but it’s a great way to audit your content. [01:12] Neil likes to make a list of all his Wordpress content, see which topics are duplicates, then plugs that into Google Search Console. Once he sees which ones are ranking, he will combine the similar posts and update his links. [02:04] This is the quickest way to audit your content and this will increase your rankings. [03:05] Using a tool like AHREFS allows you to do content gap analysis, while also offering a look at your competitors. [03:25] Content auditing doesn’t take long!

Tune in to hear why you shouldn’t hire a Harvard grad. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Why You Shouldn't Hire Harvard Graduates [00:35] People who come from Ivy League schools are smart and they are not saying not to hire them. [01:20] What you need to do, is hire people based on how creative they are and their past work. [01:38] If a candidate can turn a dud into a stud, they can probably do great work for you. [01:55] People who go to good schools are good at following instructions. When it comes to getting creative and thinking outside the box, they may not be able to do that. [02:40] When Eric was 22, there was a Harvard grad who was in the same position as Eric. The Harvard grad appeared to have no chutzpah and would come in and only do what he was told. This motivated Eric to work hard and be creative. [03:25] Affiliate marketers are the most creative, because they don’t operate based on rules. [04:15] People that operate outside boundaries and make difficult numbers work, are often successful affiliate marketers. [04:36] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear what plugins you should be using to optimize your posts. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: Our Favorite Marketing WordPress Plugins of 2018 [00:35] YouTube Subscribe Bar allows you to embed videos and include a subscribe button. However, the subscribe button will subscribe viewers to your channel instead of the channel from which the video was posted. [01:13] Yoast SEO Plugin has an XML sitemap generator. They create XML sitemaps the correct way, whereas other plugins do not. [01:37] Tools like Pretty Links help to shorten links and make them more visually appealing. [02:05] Exit Pop Ups works well with Hello Bar and Neil likes it because you can make your background an animated GIF. Animated GIFs tend to up your subscribers. [02:27] Wordable allows you to write a post in Google Sheets and then push it directly to Wordpress. [03:18] Gravity Forms is a great way to do integrations and collect payments. You can hook it in with Woocommerce or Zapier. [03:52] WP Embed Code Generator, which is great for creating embed codes for your infographics, so other people can use them. [04:09] A Blogging Checklist is an oldie, but a goodie. The checklist is an easy form for everyone to follow. It’s a dummy-proof solution. [04:46] That’s all for today!

Tune in to hear if your business can handle a shift towards cryptocurrency payments. TIME-STAMPED SHOW NOTES: [00:27] Today’s Topic: How to Boost Your Conversion Rate by Offering Bitcoin as a Payment Option [00:45] On average, bitcoin has a daily fluctuation rate of 5%. [01:15] There are a lot of people who use bitcoin, so even though most people don’t, you could open up your business if you offer bitcoin as a payment option. [01:40] You will lose money in the short-term, but in the long run, you will make more. [02:06] Eric spent the most marketing dollars on Coinmarketcap.com and they only accepted cryptocurrency as payment. [02:28] Bitcoin has gone up in price, meaning that Coinmarketcap.com made money just by hanging on to it. [03:05] Stripe recently removed bitcoin as a payment option, because they didn’t think it was practical. [03:20] However, bitcoin is still popular. [03:45] If your margins aren’t that large, don’t accept crypto, because you may suffer cash flow issues. [04:08] You can always sell some off to pay for costs, but don’t accept crypto if you don’t have high margins. [04:21] That’s all for today!

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Readies 7nm Mining Chips\nJapanese conglomerate GMO Internet Group published its first quarter results for the fiscal year 2018 last week. During the earnings results presentation, the company outlined its plans for the sale of its long-awaited 7nm bitcoin mining chips.\nGMO is building two versions of the chip, dubbed V1 and V2. The former is the initial prototype of the 7nm mining chip. The latter is for mass production of the 7nm mining chips, which the company plans to use in-house for its own mining operations, sell to the public, and use in cloud mining.\nV2 is now being designed and will enter the mass production phase in the fourth quarter of this year. Sale of 7nm Chips Starting Soon\nIn its presentation, GMO has revised its mining business plans from the fourth quarter of last year. The company now indicates that its mining operations are initially “based on store-bought mining computers,” and in roughly June the “7nm (V1) operation” will commence and in approximately October the “7nm (V2) operation” will be underway.\nAs for the sale of its 7nm bitcoin mining chips, the company spokesperson told news.Bitcoin.com:\nWe can disclose that accepting reservation will start from Q2 onwards and launch will be Q4 onwards only at this moment.\nThe actual sale dates are not specified. Furthermore, the company says its cloud mining operation will be launched in June. GMO’s Mining Business\nThe mining business was launched on December 20 through GMO’s European legal entity. It comprises three areas: “[1] In-house mining; [2] Develop, manufacture, and sell mining machines; [and 3] Cloud mining.”\nGMO says “Hash rate is increasing as planned. Amount of mined bitcoin is increasing as expected.” The company added that it has “new businesses at multiple locations in 2 countries,” noting that its hashrate in April was 241 PH/s but is confident that it will reach the target hashrate of 3,000 PH/s by the year’s end.\nIn addition to its mining business, GMO also operates a crypto exchange called GMO Coin and plans to launch a crypto payment service. The company aims “to become No. 1 in the field of cryptocurrency.”\nDo you want to buy GMO’s 7nm chips?

In addition to claiming to have licenses in 38 states, the company also claimed partnerships with Bancorp, Visa, and Mastercard to issue its own cards.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Three Founders Indicted\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Monday that the founders of a cryptocurrency-related company have been indicted in the Manhattan federal court.\nFlorida residents Sohrab Sharma, 27, Raymond Trapani, 27, and Robert Farkas, 31, are co-founders of a startup called Centra Tech. The company purported to offer cryptocurrency-related financial products including the Centra Card, a debit card which supposedly “allowed users to spend various types of cryptocurrency to make purchases at any establishment that accepts Visa or Mastercard payment cards,” the DOJ described.\nThe three were arrested last month. The US Attorney’s Office of Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized 91,000 ether which was “raised from victims as part of the charged scheme” in an initial coin offering (ICO).\nThe attorney for the United States, Robert Khuzami, explained:\nAs alleged, the defendants conspired to capitalize on investor interest in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. They allegedly made false claims about their product and about relationships they had with credible financial institutions, even creating a fictitious Centra Tech CEO. Whether traditional or cutting-edge, investment vehicles can’t legally be peddled with falsehoods and lies. ICO Worth $60+ Million\nThe three began “soliciting investors to purchase unregistered securities, in the form of digital tokens issued by Centra Tech” through an ICO in approximately July. In oral and written materials, they falsely represented that Centra Tech had an experienced executive team and “had formed partnerships with Bancorp, Visa, and Mastercard to issue Centra Cards licensed by Visa or Mastercard.” They also represented that the company “had money transmitter and other licenses in 38 states, among other claims,” the DOJ revealed, adding:\nBased in part on these claims, victims provided millions of dollars’ worth of digital funds in investments for the purchase of Centra Tech tokens.\n“In or about October 2017, at the end of Centra Tech’s ICO, those digital funds raised from victims were worth more than $25 million” – the amount which has now appreciated to more than $60 million. False Statements\nThe Department of Justice found that statements made by the three to secure these investments “were false,” emphasizing that the three “were well aware of the falsity of such claims.”\nFor example, “the purported CEO ‘Michael Edwards’ and another supposed member of Centra Tech’s executive team are fictitious people who were fabricated to dupe investors.”\nThe DOJ then described the scheme used to fabricate the CEO and another executive:\nSharma text-messaged Trapani on or about July 29, 2017, that they ‘Need to find someone who looks like Michael’…Similarly, Sharma later wrote during that same exchange: ‘Gonna kill both CEO and her [another executive],’ ‘Gonna say they were married and got into an accident.’\nFurthermore, the company’s claimed partnerships and licenses were non-existent, the DOJ revealed, citing text messages between Trapani and Sharma discussing “Centra Tech’s lack of actual partnerships with banks or credit card companies.” Another text message from Sharma to Trapani and Farkas says, “Gotta apply for all licenses,” “Should I even say this.” Four-Count Indictment\nAccording to the Justice Department’s announcement:\nAll three of them are charged in a four-count Indictment.\nOne count is “conspiracy to commit securities fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison.” The other three carry “a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison.” They are securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and wire fraud. Additionally, each charge also carries potential financial penalties. “The maximum potential prison sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge,” the DOJ wrote.\nMoreover, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has separately filed civil charges against the trio.\nWhat do you think of the DOJ indicting the three Centra Tech’s founders?

This follows market leaders such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter either severely restricting crypto ads or banning them altogether.\nAlso read: Ethereum Futures in US One Step Closer as CME Deal is Struck Microsoft’s Bing Search Engine Bans Crypto Ads\nAdvertiser Policy Manager, Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, posted an update to Microsoft’s Bing search engine ad policy. Bing Ads to Disallow Cryptocurrency Advertising is the title of the company’s rather obvious move. “We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem,” Ms. Alsoszatai-Petheo began. “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users with the potential for bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers.”\nBing has consistently ranked a very distant second behind the Google juggernaut, which gobbles up better than 60% of search traffic on the internet. Google at the beginning of 2018 announced a far more specific series of cryptocurrency related prohibitions, down to defining contract for difference (CFDs) products.\nIt wasn’t too much later when Facebook followed , as we reported at the end of January, with “a new ruling issued on January 30, ‘ads must not promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings, or cryptocurrency.’” Twitter too, a mere two months later, presented its new advertising policy, severely restricting initial coin offering (ICOs) and token sales. Protection is the Pretext\n“To help protect our users from this risk,” the notice from Bing continued, “we have made the decision to disallow advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency related products, and un-regulated binary options. Bing Ads will implement this change to our financial product and services policy globally in June, with enforcement rolling out in late June to early July.”\nOther than seeking a press cycle of promotion, it does appear “scams” were a bit of a problem during 2017, according to Bing’s annual report. “Tech scams are widely used by bad actors and we rejected 25 million ads in this category in 2017,” they insisted. And under the banner of misleading ads, Bing noted how last “year, we took down 30 million such ads, 20,000 such websites and 43,500 bad actors.”\nDo you think crypto ad bans will have a negative impact?

My own formal well-documented estimate is that Bitcoin used 0.09% of the world's electricity as of January 11th, 2018 ( http://blog.zorinaq.com/bitcoin-electricity-consumption/ ). After 4 months of growth I estimate we are around 0.15-0.20% today. Therefore reaching 0.50% by the end of 2018 is plausible; not likely but plausible. That said, overall I think Alex de Vries's figures are rather inflated because he makes two errors. Firstly, his model assumes that manufacturers sell at cost and make zero profits, which allows miners to spend more on electricity. In reality we've seen Bitmain, the largest manufacturer, make billions of dollars over the last few years. No one expects them to make zero profits by the end of 2018. Secondly, de Vries makes the mistake of assuming that all cryptocurrency mining chips produced by TSMC on behalf of Bitmain end up in Bitcoin mining machines. In reality many chips are fabricated for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. This altcoin sector is rapidly growing. It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that Bitcoin mining machines will represent less than half of Bitmain's sales by the end of 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:20:08.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f40455f9b8ed6e51527e9b71f508c9eca4eda1dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVOSsb1j9Ibm.kNkCjtnzt627e3u3.fvEoO8z2MebhCPakshpDAExyavNyx3W9NafoOJcHF9mURigv6ztSn4SQGA--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Investigation of South Korea’s Largest Crypto Exchange Upbit Continues - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Investigation of South Korea’s Largest Crypto Exchange Upbit Continues - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/upbit-banner.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f40455f9b8ed6e51527e9b71f508c9eca4eda1dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVOSsb1j9Ibm.kNkCjtnzt627e3u3.fvEoO8z2MebhCPakshpDAExyavNyx3W9NafoOJcHF9mURigv6ztSn4SQGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kevin Helms", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Investigation of South Korea’s Largest Crypto Exchange Upbit Continues - Bitcoin News", "text": "This story was shared from this site\nSince the South Korean prosecution started investigating Upbit, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, more events have unfolded. While local media still discuss allegations and raise questions about Upbit’s business practice, some people believe that Upbit is already in the clear. The investigation continues.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nThe Allegations\nLocal media reported on Friday that South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation for alleged fraud. More information has surfaced since, casting doubt on whether the allegations can be considered fraud. No charges have been filed against Upbit at the time of this writing. However, the prosecutors have confiscated the exchange’s computers and records as part of the investigation.\nOn Monday, News1 Korea described:\nProsecutors searched Upbit for fraud charges triggered by coinless transactions, suspicion of insider trading during the listing process, and allegations of money laundering and leakage of money through US trading sites.\nLiquidity Issue\nThe first allegation, the most heavily scrutinized, concerns the liquidity of some of the coins listed on Upbit.\nThe exchange currently lists 137 cryptocurrencies but not all of them have wallets. South Korean prosecutors are accusing the exchange of “book-trading” where Upbit facilitates the trading of cryptocurrencies without actually having the coins in its possession. Joongang Ilbo elaborated:\nOf the more than 130 cryptocurrencies currently traded on Upbit, about 40 do not support e-wallets.\nNews1 also pointed out that there is a viewpoint among investigators that if users request a transfer or withdrawal of their coins all at once, then Upbit will not be able to return their money immediately, which would render the original transactions fraudulent.\nHowever, some argue that “most domestic trading sites are adopting this method” except those that handle a small number of cryptocurrencies such as Bithumb, the news outlet conveyed, adding that if this method is found to be an “apparent fraud…[then] the industry will not be much affected.”\nUpbit Calls It a Misunderstanding\nUpbit says that this investigation is “something that comes from misunderstanding,” Joongang Ilbo reported.\nThe exchange has repeatedly dismissed the above accusation, emphasizing that it will secure the needed cryptocurrencies as soon as it has brokered a transaction for the coins without a wallet, the news outlet detailed. In addition, Upbit insists that it has “never bought or sold cryptocurrencies that it did not own since it opened last October.”\nFurthermore, given Upbit’s exclusive partnership with the US exchange Bitrex, crypto experts believe that “the lack of understanding of the Upbit trading system that links the system with the overseas exchange has led to the suspicion of book trading,” the publication emphasized, adding:\nCryptocurrency traded in KRW is directly managed by Upbit, and when customers buy other virtual currencies…transactions are made through Bittrex under the responsibility of Upbit.\nA representative of another crypto exchange explained that except for the won market, Upbit transactions are made through Bittrex. “It is a legitimate book deal, and the prosecutors seem to have misunderstood why they are selling cryptocurrencies that they do not have.”\nPrevious Internal Audit\nAnother factor at play is an article published by Money Today on Tuesday, referencing an internal audit which reportedly happened earlier this year. The news outlet quoted Lee Seok-woo, president of Dunamu Inc. which operates Upbit, saying that “In early March, when Upbit was suspected of only [conducting] book transactions without [holding the] coins…I have been notified that the amount of coins [in the books] is 100% identical to the number of coins” in the wallets.\nReferencing the above article, Twitter user Crypto of Korea wrote, “Upbit claimed that they had the Facebook Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news1 korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T08:21:28.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fbbdad405f4187101b9722fbd34cc9e5ff17acaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8JHvPoXWR7uWB0Ma0JQjBQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbbdad405f4187101b9722fbd34cc9e5ff17acaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8JHvPoXWR7uWB0Ma0JQjBQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nNot everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move.\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\nRead more: Snoop Dogg, Dorsey bring crypto to masses during blockchain week\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,” Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s “Blockchain Week.”“We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna irrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wibq square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:15:56.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b274bd9c74f051108b1d3eb97b55d39fe9df6fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf0XoE.c881Tvzmn9GJj8zO4Jau8DEz4vOrb_eHpsQoJS3ZV6O2sE2pGIwHUbSCf.W2Y75VA8T.YioI0BA4c_3W687cP0ThQKTfLmnlzxHYL7", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey", "title_full": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-27-e1526502699377.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b274bd9c74f051108b1d3eb97b55d39fe9df6fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf0XoE.c881Tvzmn9GJj8zO4Jau8DEz4vOrb_eHpsQoJS3ZV6O2sE2pGIwHUbSCf.W2Y75VA8T.YioI0BA4c_3W687cP0ThQKTfLmnlzxHYL7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey", "text": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet’s ‘Native Currency’: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nJack Dorsey — CEO of both Twitter and Square — hopes that bitcoin will one day be the internet’s native currency.\nDorsey made this statement during an interview with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs at a fireside chat today at the Consensus 2018 conference in New York.\nDorsey revealed that grew up in St. Louis, MI in what he described as a “huge hacker community” and that the ethos he saw growing up helped shape him into the innovative CEO of two major tech corporations that he is today.\nA major supporter of Bitcoin , Dorsey admitted that he didn’t understand the full implications of Satoshi Nakomoto’s white paper when he first read it but was nevertheless fascinated by what he did see in it.\nLater, he co-founded Square , a payment processing financial service, with Jim McKelvey, a glassblower and former employer of Dorsey’s. They developed Square as a credit card processing service, but Dorsey says the credit card aspect of things is incidental, saying the goal was to help merchants make a sale and accept payment in any way they could.\n“What we were doing was not building a credit reader[…] it was helping him make a sale,” he said, adding:\n“Any payment that comes across the counter a seller should be able to accept. They should only consider making the sale, not the currency used to make the sale.” What Changed Between 2014 – 2017? Jack Dorsey has long been a fan of bitcoin, and this interest is now evident in at least one of his company’s products, as Square’s Cash App now allows users to buy and sell BTC. | Source: Shutterstock\nDorsey said the main thing that changed for him was that community participation in Bitcoin increased. “It felt electric,” he said.\nDuring a Cash App hack week in January 2018, Dorsey set a goal to build a system where using the cash cart on Apple Pay he could go across the street and buy a cappuccino in the cafe in the Twitter building using Bitcoin . He enlisted the help of his engineer Mike Brock on the Tuesday of the event, with only a few days left.\nThey ran into a deployment issue and missed the Friday goal, but achieved the goal on Tuesday the following week. After that they dedicated Brock to building Bitcoin within Square Cash, saying the feeling of solving the issue was “amazing.”\nDorsey moved the project away from being a simple payment device and more into buying and selling.\n“We felt the buying and selling interface that existed at the time wasn’t simple enough and it didn’t really provide access to people in a way that we thought it could,” he said.\nStark cracked a joke that the Cash app was “the real Bitcoin Cash” which didn’t quite land, before bringing the conversation to how and why Dorsey applied his expertise to the Square Cash app, the P2P payment application for mobile phones.\n“Square is good at speed and simplicity. We wanted it to be as simple as a cash app today, but ultimately wanted it to be fast,” he said. “We wanted to make sending money as easy as talking.”\nInitially, they worked with the idea of sending money via email also during a hacking event, and while it worked, they concluded that email was not the way to go, which is why they created the app, along with a Visa-branded debit card to go along with it. Dorsey discussed the implications for having banking alternatives in the modern world and what it meant for financial freedom.\n“What we’re seeing now is people are using it as their bank account,” he said.\nIn some cases, people are using the app as their only bank account, and while providing financial services to the unbanked wasn’t a stated goal of the project, the team leaned into it when they saw the potential ramifications of their and similar projects on the financial space.\nDorsey admits that the 2017 adoption of Bitcoin was a contentious move within the company, but spoke of his personal beliefs on the matter and why he was so determined to see it through, interrupted twice by applause from the audience. He said he believes that the world will have a global currency and that the hopes that currency will be bitcoin.\n“It’s going to happen – and so, as a company and also as individuals we need to learn how to help make that happen. The biggest thing I worry about as a company is there’s so much amazingness in the openness of the community and I want to make sure from a corporate standpoint that nothing ever threatens that, and what can we do to help the community to help the open source nature of the work?”\nDorsey stated categorically that he felt no government or corporate body should by definition own Bitcoin or any other decentralized cryptocurrency, acknowledging that Square was a centralized company profiting from the decentralized technology. He said the goal was to continue to enable people to transact freely between each other, and invited the community to “call us out” on any perceived wrongdoings or missteps that were not in the best interests of the cryptocurrency space.\nDorsey foresees a decentralized workforce in the cards for both Square and Twitter, saying the mega offices that they currently have for both companies are a “thing of the past” and that people are starting to work where they feel most creative. Could Square Become Obsolete?\nStark questioned whether, like Bitcoin, Square may not be the ultimate solution in terms of P2P payment and cryptocurrency services, to which Dorsey candidly responded,”I actually don’t know.”\nHe stated that it was indeed possible that Square would act as stepping stone for future projects, but felt that what they were doing was an important step in the current climate. Dorsey said he resisted giving grand predictions over five or 10 years, saying the main thing was to have the patience to wait and adapt to circumstances as they come with an open mind, saying:\n“The internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be Bitcoin or not,” he said. “I hope it will be bitcoin.”\nFeatured Image from Consensus 2018 Follow us on Telegram .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakomoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim mckelvey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "elizabeth stark of lightning labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:36:18.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d92243cda5646d580d9c5e516db2479b0f7032b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT9eXAb7OTIEtKZsBBFmlIn7qMoPADGDXzS1ItELx59mf2DKiaywkM3i4jdRRAX8fYFo4v49JufksqIsUX2h25DnqTMyqC4r0I-", "site_full": "www.pcmag.com", "site": "pcmag.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["computer_reviews", "tech", "antivirus_software"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jack Dorsey Talks Bitcoin and Blockchain | News & Opinion | PCMag.com", "title_full": "Jack Dorsey Talks Bitcoin and Blockchain | News & Opinion | PCMag.com", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/588217-electronic-hands-holding-bitcoin-symbol.jpg?thumb=y&width=810&height=456", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16, "comments": 0, "shares": 16}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d92243cda5646d580d9c5e516db2479b0f7032b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT9eXAb7OTIEtKZsBBFmlIn7qMoPADGDXzS1ItELx59mf2DKiaywkM3i4jdRRAX8fYFo4v49JufksqIsUX2h25DnqTMyqC4r0I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rob Marvin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jack Dorsey Talks Bitcoin and Blockchain | News & Opinion | PCMag.com", "text": "News & Analysis / Jack Dorsey Talks Bitcoin and Blockchain The Twitter and Square founder closed out the Consensus conference with why he believes a global digital currency is an inevitability.

Square started accepting Bitcoin in 2014 before nearly any other major credit card processing or payments platforms, and Dorsey has long been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nWhen @jack himself walked onstage to close out the Consensus conference in New York City, moderator Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs couldn't help but reference a famous crypto tweet about Jack Dorsey walking into a Bitcoin conference. Jack Dorsey walking into the Bitcoin conference pic.twitter.com/ibQfgh3noa — Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) November 15, 2017\nDorsey touched on a host of different topics during his appearance: Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency landscape; the role both Square and Twitter might play in using and advancing blockchain technology; and why he thinks it's only a matter of time before we have a global digital currency. Here are some of the higlights.\nOn Square's decision to support Bitcoin in 2014 :\nDorsey: I didn't really understand the implications of it until three or four years ago when we had some Square engineers who wanted to build Bitcoin acceptance into our online store. I said yes, it took about three or four months, and they made it so any seller could accept Bitcoin without knowing they were taking Bitcoin at all.\nOn the backlash to supporting Bitcoin as a public company:\nDorsey: This was a pretty contentious move in the company. We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were skeptics of the technology. [Square] always takes the mindset that we can't wait for things to happen to us. If we want responsible, healthy uses of this technology that I believe is a fundamental shift in our world with so many positive outcomes, we need to make that happen.\nWe pushed through and it really tested us. Not just because we're a public company, but because there was more of a spotlight on us. There are a lot of unknowns, and we just ran toward them and tried to figure them out.\nOn adding support to Square Cash in 2017:\nDorsey: With Square Cash another opportunity came up back in January 2017. I saw all these conversations on Twitter about it, and the community was interesting. It felt like Usenet all over again.\nAt a hackathon that January I asked one of our engineers if we could work on Bitcoin, and the next day we committed to a goal to build a system where using my Cash card I could go across the street to Twitter HQ and buy a cappucino with a Bitcoin. We worked all week and started listening to other folks as well. We almost got there...we ran into a deployment issue and didn't actually hit the goal but it felt electric. We decided to dedicate Mike [the engineer] to building Bitcoin within Square Cash.\"\nOn the inevitability of a global digital currency:\nDorsey: We want to continue to level the playing field and give people a chance to participate in the economy. I don't know whether it will be Bitcoin or something else, but I'm a huge fan and appreciate the technology and principles behind it. We're going to have a native currency that can be global, that was invented on the internet, evolved on the internet, critiqued on the internet, and developed on the internet. It's going to happen.\nOn Square's role in the future of cryptocurrency:\nDorsey: The biggest thing I worry about as a company is making sure nothing from a corporate standpoint ever threatens the openness of the community and the open-source nature of cryptocurrency. No corporation or goverment body should own this. We're a centralized organization, but we can benefit from decentralization and I want to see more of it. Related There's a Fundamental Divide in the Blockchain World\nThe internet is going to have a native currency. That's our ethos and we're going to do our part. If we ever go away from that, call us out, please. Hold us accountable to the right thing for the technology and the community. Our business concerns follow that. We can't do any of this without the technology being strong.\nOn blockchain's potential for Twitter:\nDorsey: On the Twitter side, there are a lot of applications in trust and identity. We can apply a lot of those technologies toward the problems we're seeing in terms of misinformation , manipulation, and we're trying to fight scams as well. There are broad applications of the technology and we're going to have an open mindset.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth stark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neeraj k. agrawal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter and square", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lightning labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:12:41.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93d3fa23ebe84d1eddbd814c36cc597b57b715b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF55xlPEs2jYuAZU_tReL1KsWrkqZLH9H98l.zBRG2RPQ6Ug_rGkWOUsTwUMNrXFPrygxAzNc1RWIf.QQBb6fc8bs84s4reYq0V8_pHeDOZmmv", "site_full": "www.bnn.ca", "site": "bnn.ca", "site_section": "https://www.bnn.ca/news-wire", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "News Wire", "title": "Bitcoin True Believers Still Waiting on Conference Fueled Rally", "title_full": "Bitcoin True Believers Still Waiting on Conference Fueled Rally - Article - BNN", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1077977!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/bc-bitcoin-bounce.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38530, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93d3fa23ebe84d1eddbd814c36cc597b57b715b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF55xlPEs2jYuAZU_tReL1KsWrkqZLH9H98l.zBRG2RPQ6Ug_rGkWOUsTwUMNrXFPrygxAzNc1RWIf.QQBb6fc8bs84s4reYq0V8_pHeDOZmmv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg News", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin True Believers Still Waiting on Conference Fueled Rally", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- While the Lamborghinis turned out to be rented and the street protest a marketing gimmick for New York’s Blockchain Week, what’s really leaving some virtual currency enthusiasts disillusioned is the failure of Bitcoin to rally.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors, one of the industry’s best known analysts, noted prior to this week’s Consensus conference in New York that Bitcoin was relatively cheap and said it was poised to rally even more than in past years.

Pre-registration has already begun. Initially, 10 cryptocurrencies will be offered, but the company plans to add more throughout the year. The company’s crypto business has boomed in recent years, with 70% of its users reportedly trading cryptocurrencies.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Etoro Launching in the US\nSocial investment platform Etoro has announced that it is expanding into the US market. CEO Yoni Assia unveiled the company’s plans at the Consensus conference on Tuesday. According to the announcement:\nThe launch will initially enable U.S.-based users to invest in 10 cryptocurrencies, with more to be added throughout 2018. Users will have access to a community feed and tools, letting them engage in conversations about cryptocurrencies and follow the investment strategies of other U.S. users.\nLaunched in 2007, Etoro is regulated in Europe by Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission and in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority. The company says it has more than 10 million registered users across 140 countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia, with an accumulated capital funding of more than $162 million. Currently, its website shows 247,387,974 open trades on the platform.\nAssia commented, “Etoro will continue to focus on simplicity and user-friendliness so that more diverse groups will feel welcomed into the global crypto community.” Pre-Registration Begins for US Users\nThe company explained that US users can join the waiting list for the platform starting on May 15. “Users will be able to experience the interface and perform mock cryptocurrency investments via a virtual portfolio,” its announcement details, adding:\nThe 10 cryptocurrencies that will be initially available are: bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, XRP, dash, bitcoin cash, stellar, ethereum classic, NEO, and EOS. Etoro intends to integrate several more cryptocurrencies throughout 2018.\n“The platform will offer U.S. investors three ways to access the crypto markets,” Etoro described. The first way is “by manually investing in a coin.” The second is “by automatically copying the trades of other traders on the platform to benefit from their knowledge and investment expertise.” The third is “by investing in a Crypto Copyfund which provides a diversified portfolio of major crypto assets.”\nA Copyfund is Etoro’s investment product aimed at helping investors minimize long-term risk, its website states. “Once you invest in a Copyfund, your capital is professionally managed by Etoro’s investment committee. Each Copyfund’s performance is analysed in depth and rebalanced automatically to maximise its gain potential.” Etoro’s Booming Crypto Business\nIn January last year, the platform added cryptocurrencies. According to Fortune, “In recent years, the company’s crypto business has boomed with 70% of its users trading digital currency.” Yoni Assia.\nIn an interview with the news outlet, Assia predicted that Etoro’s “unusual social media features would help it gain a foothold” in the US. “Those features let users create a public profile of their investments, which in turn allows others on Etoro to track and copy their trading decisions.”\nCommenting on the crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeting tokens that resemble securities, Assia told the publication that he is confident “the digital assets Etoro plans to list are currencies not securities.” He expects Etoro will list as many as 15 tokens by the end of the year, the news outlet conveyed, adding that the company also “plans to open a global wallet and exchange service later this year that is aimed at institutional traders.”\nCurrently, the aforementioned ten cryptocurrencies are already being offered on the platform for non-US users.\nWhat do you think of Etoro launching in the US?

Price has quite a way to go before testing the neckline at $8,800. An upside break could lead to an uptrend of the same height as the double bottom formation. Bitcoin price formed a double bottom pattern on its 1-hour time frame and needs to break past the neckline to confirm the climb. Technical Indicators Signals The 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the downtrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 200 SMA lines up with the pattern’s neckline to add to its strength as a ceiling. If it holds, another bottom could be formed. RSI is on the move up to indicate that buyers have enough energy to push for more gains, but the oscillator is also nearing overbought levels to reflect exhaustion. Stochastic is also heading north but could be due to turn back down form overbought levels soon, so bitcoin price might follow suit. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView Market Factors Investors continue to hold out for positive updates in the industry but until those come out, caution has prevailed after bitcoin price was rejected at one resistance level after another. Traders are also keeping close tabs on the investigation into South Korea’s largest crypto exchange as this revives issues on regulation and security. In contrast, the dollar has been firmly supported by stronger rate hike hopes, particularly for the Fed meeting in June. Although some data points have fallen short of estimates, traders are paying closer attention to positive figures on inflation and shrugging off downbeat remarks from FOMC members. Looking ahead, it could be all about market sentiment from here as a week without industry developments could draw more sellers in.\nFull details at

Demos\nA digital-currency startup backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is now worth about $3 billion after a new fundraising round.\nCircle Internet Financial Ltd. disclosed the new valuation Tuesday, making it one of the most highly valued financial technology startups in the U.S.\nThe increase in the Boston-based trading firm's value, more than seven times the level achieved at a prior fundraising in 2016, stems from the recent explosion of interest in bitcoin and other so-called digital assets.\nIndeed, despite a 40% decline this year, bitcoin is still making fortunes for companies that deal in the volatile currency. In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group. Goldman is not among the new round's investors.\nFive-year-old Circle's first product was designed for buying bitcoin and moving traditional money between individuals by using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nBut in the past year, its other business, facilitating big trades of digital currencies, has surged in volume and revenue.\nThat desk, called Circle Trade, says it has traded about $4 billion in the past month, handling trades from institutions, companies and wealthy individuals, Circle said. The company has said it generated $250 million in revenue from November to January.\nBy one measure, Circle is now the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency startup. Its $3 billion equity valuation surpasses that of Coinbase, which raised money at a $1.6 billion valuation late last year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\nCircle is one of a handful of so-called over-the-counter market makers who augment the smaller-value trades on exchanges, alongside such firms as Cumberland Mining. At least one big bank, Goldman, is exploring a role for itself in trading around cryptocurrencies.\nAs part of the funding, Bitmain will also join Circle's new project to launch new digital coins that can be exchanged for a fixed amount of traditional, or fiat, currency.\nJeremy Allaire, Circle's chief executive and co-founder, said the new coin and fundraising is part of the company's \"long-term vision for what's possible in building a new global economic system.\"\nCircle also recently acquired a digital asset exchange, Poloniex, and a retail investment application, now called Circle Invest.\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com\n 13:08 ET (17:08 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "telis demos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital currency startup soars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle internet financial ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:14:11.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "902ee12ee9cd4dd135bbab5b4feb5675aae4f45a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS4GpAIpHUVDnJLF3PreKy8I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "902ee12ee9cd4dd135bbab5b4feb5675aae4f45a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS4GpAIpHUVDnJLF3PreKy8I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite your friends now to grow your network rapidly.

The company now indicates that its mining operations are initially “based on store-bought mining computers,” and in roughly June the “7nm (V1) operation” will commence and in approximately October the “7nm (V2) operation” will be underway.\nAs for the sale of its 7nm bitcoin mining chips, the company spokesperson told news.Bitcoin.com:\nWe can disclose that accepting reservation will start from Q2 onwards and launch will be Q4 onwards only at this moment.\nThe actual sale dates are not specified. Furthermore, the company says its cloud mining operation will be launched in June. GMO’s Mining Business\nThe mining business was launched on December 20 through GMO’s European legal entity.

Moscow, March 1, 2018. CREDIT: Artyom GeodakyanTASS via Getty Images\nThe only thing more over-hyped than Bitcoin is the question about the fraction of world energy now consumed by the trendy virtual currency — and how much it will use in the near future. A flawed new analysis is only adding fuel to the fire.\n“ Bitcoin mining on track to consume all of the world’s energy by 2020 ,” a Newsweek headline claimed in December. In January, the New York Times wrote “ The total network of computers plugged into the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy each day as some medium-size countries — which country depends on whose estimates you believe.” Advertisement\nThe New York Times’ statement is simply false. It confuses “electricity” with “energy,” which is a mistake much of the media continues to make. A nation’s total energy consumption includes oil used for transportation, as well as fuels used for heating, like natural gas, coal, and wood — electricity is just one part of the whole energy system. So, Bitcoin may soon consume as much electricity as some modest size countries, but electricity is well under half of total energy consumption.\nThe Times statement is also based on an analytical approach that uses an “invalid methodology,” as Dr. Jon Koomey , a leading expert on information technology energy use, explained to ThinkProgress.\nPredictions of Bitcoin’s future energy use ignore widespread efforts aimed at making virtual currencies far more efficient.\nCreating new Bitcoins and verifying transactions using so-called blockchain “proof of work” technology is certainly electricity intensive. Anyone and indeed everyone who can solve very complicated computational problems can validate transactions, and in turn earn Bitcoins.\nHere’s one of the most popular online video explanations of this complex scheme:\nBecause the central process behind Bitcoin transactions is computationally intensive, it is electricity intensive. That drives Bitcoin miners toward ever greater computing power and electricity consumption, especially as Bitcoins soared in value in 2017. Advertisement\nCalculating how much total electricity is being used around the world for every Bitcoin transaction is a very complicated task. “There is so little credible data on these [Bitcoin mining] facilities that there will be uncertainty on Bitcoin electricity use for some time to come,” explained Koomey, who led the End-Use Forecasting group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for many years. So “people should stop jumping to conclusions based on poorly estimated guesses.”\nOne of the estimates that has received a lot of attention is by Alex De Vries, who blogs at Digiconomist.net and created the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. On Wednesday, De Vries published a new Commentary in Joule, “ Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem .”\nAn accompanying press release asserts, “Bitcoin estimated to use half a percent of the world’s electric energy by end of 2018.” Since total global electricity consumption is about 25,000 TeraWatt-hours ), 0.5 percent would be 125 TWh (125,000 GWh).\nKoomey explains the problem with the analysis:\nDe Vries uses an invalid methodology to do his estimates, making guesses about electricity prices paid by bitcoin miners as well as the percentage of bitcoin price that is [tied to] energy to calculate electricity consumption. No credible analyst would ever do this. The correct way to calculate these numbers is to build from the bottom up, using knowledge about actual bitcoin technologies and operations to make sure the parameters are in the ballpark. That’s what Marc Bevand does , with the caveat that there is a lot of uncertainty (a fact that Bevand explicitly acknowledges).\nThe top down approach is like trying to estimate U.S. energy consumption starting with U.S. GDP and making some back of the envelope calculations (about how much of GDP goes to energy and then what the cost of energy is). Bevand’s bottom-up approach would look at actual hardware — cars, houses, airplanes, and steel mills — and their actual energy consumption and then try to add it all up. It’s harder, but more accurate. Advertisement\nNote that Bevand’s best estimate is that as of January 2018, total global Bitcoin electricity consumption is 18.4 TWh, which is under 0.1 percent of global electricity consumption.\n“If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted,” the news release for the article warns, “de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5 percent of the world’s electricity.”\nYet as Koomey explained to ThinkProgress, “people need to see the larger context: Data center electricity use as a whole (of which Bitcoin is only a small part) has been flat since 2008 or so.” And it comprises only about 1.8 percent of all U.S. electricity.”\nKoomey was a coauthor of LBNL’s 2016 “ U.S. Data Center Energy Usage Report .” For the past two decades, he has been debunking claims that the Internet will engulf an ever-growing fraction of the global electricity. He and LBNL have also been working with IT companies to help them become more efficient. Ignore the media hype and keep Googling—The energy impact of web searches is very LOW\nIndeed, a major reason why data center electricity consumption did not achieve the kind of worst-case projections that had been made over a decade ago — the kind that are now being made for Bitcoin — is that the industry adopted more efficient hardware and more efficient software, to minimize energy costs.

Initially, the company focussed on doing so for the seller in particular.\nDorsey said that his first boss couldn’t sell a piece of glass art because he had no way to accept a credit card.\n“We dedicated a month to enabling him to accept a credit card…enabling him to make a sale.”\nThe company came up with their familiar compact, square card-reading device and continued to innovate around making all aspects of taking payments with the device easier for sellers.\nDorsey was also drawn to the early Internet’s cypherpunk subculture, where freedom inclined programmers pursued privacy through cryptography. Dorsey was “drawn to cryptography,” he said, but “wasn’t good at it.”\nHe recognized along with others at the time that, “a currency backed by strong cryptography was the ultimate (cryptography) application.” He “appreciated” Bitcoin but didn’t really understand it…”until about 3 or 4 years into Square,” when several of the company’s Bitcoin-enthused engineers worked to make it so any customer could pay with Bitcoin and the seller, “wouldn’t have to think about it.”\nThis initial trial with Bitcoin was shelved:\n“We launched…learned…didn’t see many transactions…Another opportunity came up (with Square cash) in 2017…”\nStark asked what had changed in the interim.\n“(The community) felt electric again,” said Dorsey. He and the engineers set the goal of being able to buy a cappuccino with Bitcoin at a cafe in the Twitter building. Again, the focus was on totally seamless, almost invisible Bitcoin payments.\nThis fixation on utterly smooth payments is what has allowed Square to compete. According to Dorsey, Square is, “good at speed and simplicity,” on the seller side, where as credit card systems can be “scary and complex” for sellers.\nInitially, Square sought to make Bitcoin payments “as simple as talking or emailing” where you could put the payment amount in a subject line. The goal was to “first, make it work (and) then make it secure.”\nUnfortunately the email system was hacked and failed. Determined, Square moved to develop their cash app, despite the fact that competitors Venmo and Paypal were already well-established there.\nStark asked about the demographics of Square Cash App users.\nInterestingly, Square has found a significant body of users among the, “underserved and even unbanked,” said Dorsey, something the company wants to “lean into more”:\n“What we’re seeing now is people are using it as their (primary) bank account,” he said. The majority of Square Cash App payments are flowing in from Walmart, McDonalds, and a number of other fast food outlets.\nAccording to Dorsey, relationships with their young and mobile customers have been supported by, “maintaining our personality…simple access (and)…reaching the underbanked and underserved and in a fun way that feels modern.”\nUser behaviour also drove the company’s interest in Bitcoin.\n“We saw people trying to buy Bitcoin using the cash card…people were showing the intent…so we built that right in…”\nDorsey claims to have been also been educating customers in the risks of using Bitcoin, and Square has created a Bitcoin children’s book.\nNotably, Stark claimed that Square was one of the first companies to seek a cryptocurrency consult with the SEC, whose representatives recently stated that they do not consider Bitcoin a security. “In part,” said Stark, “thanks to the efforts of Square.”\nAs to whether or not Bitcoin will prevail in the low-intensity cryptocurrency war currently underway, Dorsey could not say:\n“The Internet deserves a native currency,” he said. “I hope it will be (Bitcoin).” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cali haan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth stark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:25:36.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7847f7ba3e65a5391eb491635fcd4b7bd3cc9dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBRMlr7bV_IbAEjApjgcwf5MK5E5S.rX6H_fLrSUnBXEGCSOcancNtuhaBQo0lBlk-", "site_full": "digitalminer.net", "site": "digitalminer.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Tax Calculator | Digital Miner", "title_full": "Bitcoin Tax Calculator | Digital Miner", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.381, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7847f7ba3e65a5391eb491635fcd4b7bd3cc9dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBRMlr7bV_IbAEjApjgcwf5MK5E5S.rX6H_fLrSUnBXEGCSOcancNtuhaBQo0lBlk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Tax Calculator | Digital Miner", "text": "\nBitcoin Tax Calculator\nIf you are a U.S. resident that invested in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in 2017, you may have recently received a tax document from the trading platform or cryptocurrency exchange you use and may need to pay taxes. While there is currently very little guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrency, one thing is clearly defined. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) views cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes. That means you likely received a tax document because you either experienced a capital gain on that virtual investment in 2017 or received cryptocurrency as compensation, which is seen as ordinary income to the IRS.\nFor practical purposes, the IRS has issued guidance defining cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as virtual currencies. This guidance is subject to interpretation, but for most people the main things to consider from a tax perspective are: How long you held your Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies from purchase to sale? If held for less than a year, any profit may be liable for short-term capital gains tax. If held for longer than a year, any profit may be liable for long-term capital gains tax. What is your tax filing status and taxable income? That will determine your tax bracket and the tax rate on any Bitcoin profits. What is your state tax rate? That will determine how much you may owe in state taxes. Bitcoin Tax Calculator Instructions Part 1: Enter Your Personal Details\nStep 1: Select the tax year you would like to calculate your estimated taxes. Step 2: Select your tax filing status. Step 3: Enter your taxable income excluding any profit from Bitcoin sales. For most people, this is the same as adjusted gross income (AGI) . Step 4: Enter your state’s tax rate. Part 2: For each Bitcoin sale within a tax year\nStep 1: Enter the purchase date and purchase price. The purchase date can be any time up to December 31st of the tax year selected.Step 2: Enter the sale date and sale price. Make sure the sale date is within the tax year selected.Step 3: Repeat for all Bitcoin or cryptocurrency sales within the tax year selected.

A Decentralized World in Your Pocket\nCalled the HTC Exodus, the smartphone is slated to include a built-in secure hardware enclave and is aimed at “helping underlying protocols expand their base of dedicated nodes, thus expanding the total blockchain ecosystem.” Phil Chen, who has returned to HTC as the company’s Decentralized Chief Officer, writes in a post on Medium :\nI want to see a world where the end consumers can truly own their data (browsing history, identity, assets, wallets, emails, messaging, etc) without the need for central authorities. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe the mobile hardware layer can contribute significantly to our new decentralized world.\n— HTC Exodus (@htcexodus) May 15, 2018\nThe HTC Exodus will support underlying protocols, including Bitcoin , Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and others. According to Chen, the team is working to support the entire blockchain ecosystem and will, therefore, be announcing a whole slew of new partnerships in the coming months. “Together, we want to craft the best blockchain & decentralized application experiences to end consumers,” he stated.\nOf course, the phone will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. More interestingly, each Exodus smartphone will purportedly act as a node for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. If successful, every phone would essentially expand the scope of both leading cryptocurrencies.\nKey members of the HTC Exodus team include Sean Moss-Pultz, Edith Yeung, Chris McCann, Elizabeth Stark, and Dominic Williams.\nCurrently, details regarding the price of the phone are scant. It is also unknown whether or not HTC will go all the way by allowing customers to purchase the phone with cryptocurrency .\nNevertheless, Chen hopes the new phone from HTC will open up the world of decentralized systems to a mainstream market. Stated the DCO:\nWe think that the phone can be an agent in the future for decentralization. We want you to hold your own key [through] a secure management method in our phones.\nWhat do you think of the HTC Exodus? Would such a phone pull you away from your iPhone or other models?

The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna irrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "win 98.5 square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:38:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c21fbc30b05a7db80c459afc8ec1dd8f226e09d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbjIExNOR2KVtWN56XM.G5OU9pN0gH904pLiwiDZMuhez4-", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "951 How He Created LiteCoin, the Silver to Bitcoin Gold", "title_full": "951 How He Created LiteCoin, the Silver to Bitcoin Gold", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20160408155709-default-hero-entrepreneur.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c21fbc30b05a7db80c459afc8ec1dd8f226e09d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbjIExNOR2KVtWN56XM.G5OU9pN0gH904pLiwiDZMuhez4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "951 How He Created LiteCoin, the Silver to Bitcoin Gold", "text": "More Details Hear the dynamic voices behind our featured podcasts.

(I have occasionally also argued that the story of cryptocurrency might actually be the opposite, that it’s about traveling back in time to progressively forget the lessons of modern finance, but never mind that.)\nIn many ways this is a snarky and condescending thing to think; the implication is that the crypto people had simplistic and naive expectations about how trustless decentralized purely market-based finance could work, and are slowly discovering the obvious-to-the-rest-of-us benefits of trust and central counterparties and regulation and non-market mechanisms. On this theory, financial history is a journey from darkness into enlightenment, and those of us who have seen the light can watch in amusement as cryptocurrencies make the same journey.\nOn the other hand that’s not actually how many people think of financial history! “The most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine,” Paul Volcker famously said , and there are plenty of people who would argue that at least the past few decades of financial history have been a story of reckless deregulation, risk, scandal, inequality, over-financialization and rent-seeking. On this view, if cryptocurrency does quickly repeat the history of conventional finance—if in two years we end up with too-big-to-fail Bitcoin banks that use chat rooms to manipulate crypto indexes and set up fake accounts for their users—then that will be bad . Cryptocurrency’s original promise wasn’t simplistic and naive; it was idealistic and pure, and importing all the controversial features of scandal-plagued modern finance will be a tragedy.\nAnyway Bitcoin has discovered co-location for high-frequency traders :\nCoinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading. ...\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times.\nCoinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location.\nThat’s fine! Catering to professional market makers— having professional market makers, for that matter—is probably a way to make the market better and more useful for most investors. “These additions will allow for a more efficient price discovery process to occur, creating tighter markets, deeper liquidity, and increased certainty of execution,” says Coinbase . It is a stage of enlightenment, an adoption of useful ideas from conventional finance. (Along with the co-location, Coinbase is also “developing several tools to lure institutional investors onto its platform,” including “custodial services where investors can store large amounts of digital currencies”; obviously having a safe place to put your Bitcoins would be a positive development—and a change from Bitcoin’s original promise of decentralization.)\nOn the other hand that’s not actually how many people think about exchanges that cater to high-frequency traders! I mean, co-location, my word:\nCoinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nSome number of people got into Bitcoin because they felt like the conventional financial system was rigged against them, and I suspect that some number of them felt like that because stock exchanges let high-frequency traders pay to run their algorithms right next to the exchanges’ servers so they could have faster access to the exchange than anyone else. And now here we are.\nObviously neither of these narratives is really right; financial history is not a story of uninterrupted progress to pure efficiency nor one of absolute corruption by evil entrenched interests. It’s mostly a series of good-faith tradeoffs under uncertainty, many of which could conceivably have gone the other way. U.S. securities laws, for instance, have an onerous and one-size-fits-all set of disclosure requirements for anyone who wants to raise money by selling securities to the general public; this makes it much easier to police fraud , but also makes it harder for disruptive entrepreneurs to raise money to fund real projects and for small investors to participate in high-growth investments. And there are those in the crypto community who argue that the tradeoff should go the other way in cryptocurrency regulation: Let a million blockchain projects bloom, accept that most of them will be frauds, but do it anyway to foster innovation.\nThat is interesting, or at least potentially interesting. ( Not all of the regulators are moved by it! But some seem to be.) Watching cryptocurrency create an alternate financial history, one in which some of those choices go another way, in which the balance is struck (say) in favor of more fraud and more innovation, or more democracy and less professionalization, or whatever, is the real appeal of the cryptocurrency revolution. If, after learning all of its lessons, it just converges entirely on old-fashioned finance—but with a different set of powerful incumbent billionaires—then what was the point?\nElsewhere in crypto exchanges, here's a story about how Israeli crypto exchange eToro will open to U.S. investors. And: “Crypto Exchange Kraken Says It Will Probably Register With SEC .” And: “ ‘Privacy Coin’ ZCash Lands on Winklevoss’s Gemini Exchange.”\nAnd elsewhere in crypto, the Consensus 2018 conference is going on in New York this week and it is exhausting just to read about. Here’s a story about how the BitMex exchange rented some Lamborghinis to sit around revving outside the conference because, you know, crypto Bitcoin blockchain Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo. Here's a story about how “the smell of marijuana wafted through a half-filled event space in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District, as a group of cryptocurrency believers downed champagne and blood orange margaritas” and listened to Snoop Dogg at an afterparty thrown by Ripple Labs Inc.:\nAround 9 p.m., Snoop Dogg arrived to an adoring crowd sporting Patagonia fleeces, button-up shirts and Team Ripple tees.\n“So what we get drunk, so what we smoke weed,” they sang along as Snoop strutted onstage flanked by dancers in rhinestone bras and a person in a canine costume, wearing a jacket with ‘Dirty Dogg’ written on the back.\nDo you think that the majority of people at the majority of Snoop Dogg shows circa 2018 are wearing button-up shirts and Patagonia fleeces? Surely yes, right? These days I feel like the dress code for any Snoop Dogg show is probably business casual.\nCBS v. Redstone.\nWe talked yesterday about CBS Corp.’s amazing effort to get rid of its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., by issuing enough voting stock to other shareholders to dilute away NAI’s control. The point of this effort would be to prevent Redstone and NAI from using their voting power to fire CBS’s directors and try to force through a merger with Viacom Inc., another company controlled by Redstone. A flaw in CBS’s plan is that it had to give Redstone notice of the board meeting (scheduled for tomorrow) at which it will issue those new shares, and so she can fire them before they hold that meeting. But it asked a Delaware court to enjoin her from doing that, so it could go and get rid of her in peace.\nLater yesterday NAI filed its reply to that lawsuit, which denies the basic conflict that CBS claimed—\nPlaintiffs suggest that NAI intends to force such a merger by removing and replacing the CBS independent directors. There is no truth to that. NAI does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS Board or taking other action to force a merger. Plaintiffs’ supposed belief to the contrary is based on unsourced media reports and conjecture.\n—but also notes that, even if it were true, diluting away Redstone’s ownership “would still be egregiously overbroad and unjustified”:\nIf Plaintiffs were genuinely concerned that NAI would seek to force a merger upon the company, and NAI had not committed to refrain from doing so during the pendency of this action, the relief to which Plaintiffs would even plausibly be entitled would be an injunction to prevent NAI from forcing a merger upon the company while this litigation is pending. It would not be to dilute NAI’s voting power, for all purposes, now and forever. This is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder’s voting power.\nLook: That is obviously correct. If the controlling shareholder wants to do something bad and wrong over the board’s objection, then the board should say no. The board shouldn’t fire the controlling shareholder . That’s not even a thing. You can sort of understand the board’s point of view though. If the chief executive officer wanted to do something bad and wrong over the board’s objection, then the board really might fire him. Firing the CEO for doing bad things is how the board exerts its power, how it demonstrates that it is in control of the corporation. If the board really is supreme, if it is in control of the corporation and the shareholders are just sources of capital, then why shouldn’t it fire the shareholders too, if they make it mad enough?\nBy the way yesterday I expressed some surprise that the board would even try, but apparently there is precedent for boards trying to get rid of their controlling shareholders while the shareholders weren’t looking. (“You go on one long vacation out of cell-phone coverage and, bam, you’re out,” I wrote yesterday.) It didn’t work though. From NAI’s filing:\nThe proposed dilutive stock dividend would be invalid under Adlerstein v. Wertheimer . There, the Court recognized that where a controlling stockholder has the power to forestall board action by preemptively removing directors, the board cannot take steps to neutralize the controlling stockholder’s voting power in order to effectuate the board action. In Adlerstein , the controller had the power to remove certain directors and, recognizing this, the board kept the controller in the dark about a board proposal that destroyed his voting control over the corporation until it was too late for the controller to act. Recognizing that the controller was entitled to an adequate opportunity to protect his interests, the Court held that the directors’ decision to keep the controller uninformed about the proposal invalidated the board’s approval of the proposal.\nStill, good effort.\nOh, disclosure: CBS’s lawyers here are from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where I worked long ago. I remain very fond of Wachtell, and I don’t think that I am biased when I say that it is undoubtedly the U.S.’s leading advocate of the theory of “ board primacy ” in corporate governance. I don’t really think they will, but if they do convince a Delaware court that boards of directors should be able to get rid of shareholders they disagree with , then that would be quite a total victory for board primacy.\nShould index funds be illegal?\nNo, write Thomas Lambert and Michael Sykuta of the University of Missouri, in “ The Case for Doing Nothing About Institutional Investors’ Common Ownership of Small Stakes in Competing Firms ”:\nWe show that the theory of anticompetitive harm from institutional investors’ common ownership is implausible and that the empirical studies supporting the theory are methodologically unsound. The theory fails to account for the fact that intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified and rests upon unrealistic assumptions about managerial decision-making. The empirical studies purporting to demonstrate anticompetitive harm from common ownership are deficient because they inaccurately assess institutional investors’ economic interests and employ an endogenous measure that precludes causal inferences.\nEven if institutional investors’ common ownership of competing firms did soften market competition somewhat, the proposed policy solutions would themselves create welfare losses that would overwhelm any social benefits they secured.\nThe point that “intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified” is worth emphasizing. When people worry that common ownership of multiple firms in the same industry by big institutional investors reduces competition in that industry—the antitrust worry that I often shorthand as “should index funds be illegal?”—the theory is more or less that if all the airlines raise prices, rather than compete with each other on price, then they will all make higher profits and benefit their common shareholders at the expense of customers. But, in general, the mutual funds also own the customers. Lambert and Sykuta write:\nIntra-industry diversified mutual funds tend also to be inter-industry diversified, and maximizing one industry’s profits requires supracompetitive pricing that tends to reduce the profits of firms in complementary industries. A leading Vanguard fund, for example, holds around 2% of each major airline (1.85% of United, 2.07% of American, 2.15% of Southwest, and 1.99% of Delta) but also holds:\n• 1.88% of Expedia Inc. (a major retailer of airline tickets),\n• 2.20% of Boeing Co. (a manufacturer of commercial jets),\n• 2.02% of United Technologies Corp. (a jet engine producer),\n• 3.14% of AAR Corp. (the largest domestic provider of commercial aircraft maintenance and repair),\n• 1.43% of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (a major automobile rental company), and\n• 2.17% of Accenture (a consulting firm for which air travel is a significant cost component).\nEach of those companies—and many others—perform worse when airlines engage in the sort of supracompetitive pricing (and corresponding reduction in output) that maximizes profits in the airline industry.\nIf you do want to believe the index-funds-should-be-illegal thesis, then it may not be as simple as “giant diversified mutual funds that own lots of companies in an industry want to maximize the profits of that industry in anti-competitive ways.” Their objective function has to be a bit broader: They must want to maximize the profits of corporations , broadly, at the expense of individual consumers (and workers). That is a more nebulous theory; it is not as simple as “companies in an industry should try to keep prices high and not undercut each other by competing for market share,” but more like “companies in every industry should try to keep corporate profits high generally and not undercut each other by being nice to household consumers or workers.” It is harder to see how corporate managers would maximize that. But it is a pleasingly Marxist diagnosis of institutional investors as advocates, not of reduced competition in any particular industry, but of the interests of the capitalist class generally against those of workers and consumers.\nPeople are worried about unicorns.\nPrivate markets, I sometimes say, are the new public markets; companies used to have to go public to raise a lot of money or create secondary liquidity or achieve widespread name recognition or whatever, but now they can do all of that in the private markets. Still companies do go public sometimes, often because their venture capitalists find it easier to cash out by selling to the public than by relying on the relatively limited liquidity in private secondary markets. But the VCs are working on fixing that problem too :\nNew Enterprise Associates, one of Silicon Valley’s largest venture-capital firms, plans to sell off a big chunk of its startup investments in response to a dearth of initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nThe firm plans to sell roughly $1 billion worth of its stakes in about 20 startups to a new firm it is seeking to create, one of the people said, in an effort to return capital to its limited-partner investors. These companies will mostly be those that initially raised money from NEA about eight to 10 years ago.\nI mean it is all just pots of money. You are a private company, you go to a pot of money called “venture capital,” it gives you some money, you grow, the venture capitalists want to cash out, you go public, and the VCs sell to another pot of money called “mutual funds” or whatever. If the VCs set up a new pot of money called, like, “private secondary liquidity funds” or whatever (you might want a catchier name), then you kind of get rid of the need to go public. The trick is that those funds have to look more like mutual funds than the VC funds do; if they are buying big high-valuation stakes in mature but somehow-not-yet-public companies, then they need to be big, and they can’t expect too many of those stakes to produce enormous returns. On the other hand they shouldn’t expect most of them to go bust, either; they should expect steady reliable returns from most of their mature private investments. They just have to accept that the private markets are the new public markets.\nElsewhere :\nSoftBank Group Corp.’s near-$100 billion Vision Fund has yet to close, but its acquisitive founder is already gauging interest for a second fund.\n“Vision Fund II will definitely come. It’s just a matter of time,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said during an interview at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday.\nAnd why shouldn’t all the money in the world be in private tech investment funds?\nThings happen.\nItaly Bonds Roiled as Populists Debate $300 Billion Write-Down .

It was just a week ago that we reported on the NYSE developing a platform for cryptocurrecny trading , and now we have the first Nasdaq-powered exchange set to launch in just a few short weeks. The evidence of mainstream finance feverishly moving into blockchain is rapidly piling up. See here , here , here , and here for just for stories in the last 48 hours that will have a tremendous impact on the cryptocurrency market .\nSet to launch in June of 2018, the first Nasdaq-powered exchange will allow trading in the top 6 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin , Litecoin , Ethereum , Ripple , Bitcoin Cash, and EOS. DX.exchange will offer fiat-to-crypto trading as well as zero fees:\nThere’s a new crypto exchange in town. But if you feel that the town is getting too crowded, this resident is quite different.\ndx.exchange, which is set to launch next month, is the first crypto exchange powered by NASDAQ . “The advantage of this cooperation is threefold: the brand name, the technology and the regulations,” said DX Exchange CEO Daniel Skowronski , commenting on the topic exclusively to Finance Magnates.\nWhile the first advantage is quite self-explanatory, Skowronski further explained that their technology would rely on NASDAQ’s infrastructure, such as its matching engine – used by over 70 exchanges around the world.\nAs for the regulations, Skowronski noted that working with NASDAQ mandates that the exchange meets the highest regulatory standards, thus avoiding common errors and bugs, such as double count trading, and in general will prevent fake volumes.\nThose above-mentioned standards include a recently acquired Estonian license, as well as a market maker license from the Cypriot regulator, CySEC. This framework will allow DX to offer its clients the entire variety of the crypto trading options and to hold customers funds and deposits.\nUS customers will be excluded from approaching the platform, at this point. However, the management is currently engaged in a dialogue with the US regulators to obtain a federal license.

Dorsey sat down with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York City to talk more broadly about his company's goals for the digital currency.\n\"I'm just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don't know if it will be bitcoin,\" said Dorsey said during Wednesday's fireside chat, adding:\n\"I hope it will be bitcoin. I'm a huge fan.\"\nDorsey admits the idea that bitcoin will someday be the basis for all payments made on the Internet remains a topic of debate at Square.\n\"We've led with that mindset. But there's still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that's where the magic happens, where creativity happens,\" he explained.\nDespite the controversy, Dorsey argues that the vision of open access that bitcoin inspires is fundamental to the role Square has always played in the payments industry. \"Any payment that comes across our table, the seller should be able to accept,\" he remarked.\nWhen Dorsey first began contemplating how to implement bitcoin payments into the Square platform with Mike Brock, an engineer at the company, the two initially settled on a goal that was grandiose in its simplicity.\nEither one of them, he reasoned, should be able to walk over to the Blue Bottle across the street and buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without the transaction looking any different than a regular dollar-denominated payment, perhaps without the cashier even knowing that bitcoin was being used.\nAccording to Dorsey, the team had a working solution within a week.\n\"It felt amazing. It felt electric. And it felt like something we needed to explore a lot more,\" he said. More work to come\nSquare has yet to build a full bitcoin payments solution for merchants and consumers, as it quickly changed direction to work on a buying-and-selling service to be integrated into its Cash App. But Dorsey said that the goal is same as it has always been.\n\"We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that's why we're working with [Lightning Labs],\" said Dorsey. \"Whatever it takes to get there, we're going to make sure it happens.\"\nDorsey - who counts himself as a fan of the hacker ethos surrounding bitcoin's rise to fame - claimed that whatever path Square takes to pushing mass adoption of bitcoin payments, it will do so without threatening the openness of the network.\n\"There's so much openness in the community, and I want to make sure nothing in the corporate world threatens that,\" he stated, going on to say:\n\"We cannot risk hurting what made this possible to begin with ... We can't do any of this without the technology being strong and available for everyone.\"\nPhoto by David Floyd for CoinDesk The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .
