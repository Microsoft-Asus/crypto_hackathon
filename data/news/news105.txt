Argentina plans to become the world’s biggest player with pre-agreements to install 4,000 ATM around the South American country as part of a new government plan to install 30,000 machines in the future.\nBitcoin’s recent slump hasn’t seemed to have affected the ATM industry with reports that it’s healthier than ever, given that at the beginning of 2017 there were only 1,000 machines worldwide.\nBitcoin ATM startup BCB ATM saw its sales figures soar by 528% in just 11 months through 2017, and other companies are experiencing the same rise in sales in 2018. Rising Bitcoin prices over the past three years have accelerated the installation of machines with cryptocurrencies’ wider adoption around the world.\nThe United States remains the largest business provider for ATM companies with 1,800 machines across the country, followed by Canada with 477, and then Austria in third place with just 174, as the demand for buying and selling using the machines increases. The US capital recently doubled its ATM availability from 20 to 40 due to public demand.\nMachines which allow customers to both buy and sell have increased by 35% as manufacturers have improved hardware. These machines have proved to be profitable for operators as they charge fees for both buying and selling transactions, charging an average fee to the client of 8.77%.\nOut of the 31 total hardware manufacturers, the top three include Genesis Coin (34.37%), General Bytes (27.49%), and Lamassu (11.23%) who comprise over 70% of the entire market. Bitcoin is king with 99.9% of all ATMs supporting it, followed in popularity by Litecoin and Ethereum.\nATMs are not the only way of trading on the move as increasing outlets, now numbering in their thousands, give customers a quick trading opportunity. Customers can now purchase their Bitcoins through vouchers, gift cards and web-money kiosks, with Switzerland leading the way with Bitcoin now available as payment at 1,357 railway ticket kiosks around the alpine nation.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide and Argentina Wants 30,000 of Its Own appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.’ Some treatments at the centre will be led by Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict.\nHe said introducing a life structure is key for addicts. ‘Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem,” therapist Mr Marini said.\n‘I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. ‘The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories.

LEARN MORE Public hearings for rural electric utilities are rarely sellout events.\nBut the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow. The turnout wasn’t surprising.\nChelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.” These entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency. The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.\nAs a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum.\nBut as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basin’s three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can — or should even try to — keep up.

I personally believe there are too many early Bitcoin buyers ($5-$500 area) that are still holding. Market usually finds a way to exploit fear and greed. In my humble opinion, many of these early buyers must be shaken out to begin a true uptrend again. Not sure if 2,500 - 2,900 is low enough to scare a large amount of them to sell in the fear of losing all their profits, but it sure seems like an interesting area to me.

Castle Craig Hospital in Scotland, which runs rehabilitation courses for people with drug, alcohol and gambling addictions , has launched a programme after receiving requests to treat similar problems with cryptocurrency. My dad went to prison for what he did to feed his gambling addiction According to experts, the trading of digital currencies or assets such as bitcoin can become a behavioural addiction, similar to online gambling, with some users obsessively following minute-by-minute fluctuations in prices. Around 13 million people trade bitcoin across the world. Cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency, Castle Craig said in a statement. “This can be exciting but also addictive and, like gambling addiction, can be financially disastrous.” Mark Griffiths, professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said: “Addiction to cryptocurrencies is a sub-type of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to gambling addiction.” Chris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig, said: “The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. \"It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\" Some treatments at the centre will be led by Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, who said introducing a life structure is key for addicts.

In rough case scenario its down nearly 20% in single week. This is what make cryptocurrencies harder to trade in intraday. Even if we take positional trade a normal case risk reward ratio is 5-7% but here it moves nearly 20% in single week. Its good for speculations and bad for trading. We are tracking bitcoin as our many existing paid subscribers trades in this cryptocurrency. Kindly note we still do not provide any paid signals in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin price currently trading at 7080$, A good support on technical chart stands at 6880$, this major cryptocurrency upto 6600$ – 6400$ today.\nA good resistance on bitcoin technical chart stands at 7250$, firepower in this major cryptocurrency upto 7400$- 7600$ today.\nBitcoin analysis conclusion: Bitcoin trend is weak for now but 7000$ should act as a good psychological support. So should we buy btc/usd now at 7080$, A small buy position can be taken here with stoploss below 6980$. Silver analysis\nSilver price trading at 16.44$ slightly weaker from its last night closing. Its not following gold which is up nearly 0.40% today from its last night closing. A good resistance on silver chart stands at 16.62$, Once traders cross silver price to follow gold’s lead upto 16.84$- 17.05$ today.\n 16.20$, If traders break this support and manage to sustain trade below silver upto 16$- 15.80$.\nSilver now but buy in dips is good idea for now.\nRead our Gold forecast here\nSign up our free newsletter here for free weekly analysis and forecast.\nMore will update to our trading signals subscribers.

Never thought I’d use the word “privilege”, since I am against identity politics, but here we are. | Photo by Ali Arif Soydaş I’ve noticed something fascinating about Bitcoin, the revolution in currency that is taking place across our planet. Those who have always lived in safety, in countries that function…don’t seem to get it. Or they get it, but they don’t get why it matters . Or they get it, but they make arrogant comments about the new rich . As if upward mobility was not the rarest and most central hope of all mankind. Or they get it, but they think that criticizing governments is volatile and immature. Comfortable people have lots of sympathy for the world’s poor. But they want those poor to be helped by big, known, safe organizations, who have gained the support of the privileged through expensive marketing budgets spent on viral social media posts about how much they help. They don’t know how to react to the news that the world’s poor are helping themselves instead. It just doesn’t fit their narrative. Poverty is a problem, but they think they know the solution. The comfortable people are supposed to punish themselves for their comfort by siphoning off their earnings to be delivered to the uncomfortable people via the trusted go-between organization of choice. Well, guess what? No organization could possible accomplish that. Send all the help you want, by whatever messengers you imagine are trustworthy, but the problem is the leadership in the uncomfortable countries. And currency is the biggest and most basic of the many pain points. Currency is where you feel it the most, when you can’t feed your child and no one around you cares because they have all gotten used to not feeding their children properly, either. When barely feeding your kids becomes a cultural past time, and a badge of honor. While the government employees meant to “help you” don’t answer your calls, as they hire their nieces and nephews, build new offices for them, and throw parties in their own honor for doing so, with your taxes. While you pay a fortune to live in famine. Those who have truly suffered, in countries that don’t function, with “well-meaning” leaders who have abandoned their people, are the ones clinging to the Bitcoin revolution with both hands. Which confuses the comfortable because… Isn’t Bitcoin all about beer and pizza, and weed, and anarchy, and Lamborghinis, and models wearing see-through spandex jumpsuits promoting the latest Bitcoin exchange? What do seemingly-rich, seemingly-bored Millennial computer geeks have to do with the people of Venezuela? The answer: they all value freedom. “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.” - Ronald Reagan We attain the value of freedom through deprivation, or through wisdom. To acquire the value of freedom as a citizen of a comfortable country that functions, one must look around the world with open eyes and study history until it becomes a part of the very self. As if it had been you and yours on those battlefields. That journey leads us to value whatever humanity needs to thrive today through understanding how we have lived, and what has caused our failures and successes. Some in the movement are from comfortable countries, but have familiarized themselves with global suffering. Others are knee-deep in that suffering. And then there is everything in between. The movement is connected through a desire for freedom that will no longer wait. That will no longer settle. That will no longer hope. Some with their education, some with their ingenuity, some with their funding, and some with decades of suffering and deprivation fueling adoption and clarity of purpose. They are all participating. Anyone can appreciate Bitcoin through studying human history. Decentralization Is The Reward For Cooperation The existence and adoption of Bitcoin means that mankind is no longer fully dependent on the promises of leaders and organizations to manage their money fairly. They’ve pivoted away from the leaders and towards each other, creating their OWN solution. This is not childish — it is utterly mature. The reward for building this together is that Bitcoin, being a decentralized solution, cannot be shut down. No singular entity can take it out of circulation. And so the only question is, where are YOU in this revolution? Do you understand the value of economic freedom, even if you live in ease? Do you believe in the possibility of economic freedom, even if you live in pain and darkness? Thanks for reading.

There is a crucial bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $7,000 handle to avoid further losses in the near term. Bitcoin price is under a strong selling pressure below $7,300 against the US Dollar. Let's see if BTC/USD can hold the $7,000 support level or not.\nBitcoin Price Analysis There was no major upside recovery above $7,350 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair corrected higher a few points yesterday, but buyers failed to push the price above the $7,350 and $7,400 resistance levels. As a result, there was a downside reaction and the price broke the last swing low of $7,150. It traded close to the $7,000 level and a low was formed at $7,048.\nAt the moment, the price is consolidating losses above the $7,000 and it remains at a risk of more losses. An initial hurdle for buyers is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,445 high to $7,048 low. However, the most significant resistance is close to $7,250, which was a support earlier. The stated $7,250 level is also around the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,445 high to $7,048 low. Above $7,250, there is a crucial bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly struggling to move higher above $7,250 and $7,300. If buyers continue to struggle, bitcoin could drop sharply and it might break the $7,000 support in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is still in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently moving lower towards the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,250\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD's Struggle Continues appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T12:29:29.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "340b358ca8dbcd6eff38ef0c3367a268ee60f045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_lwjSRw.MfR0ahBsQgzWCTtx90eVnh1jW81OuBdcrUs9FErSatg0is-", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "South African Crypto Scam Update: A Bashful Bitcoin Fraudster and More than $80m Missing", "title_full": "South African Crypto Scam Update: A Bashful Bitcoin Fraudster and More than $80m Missing", "published": "2018-05-29T12:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "340b358ca8dbcd6eff38ef0c3367a268ee60f045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_lwjSRw.MfR0ahBsQgzWCTtx90eVnh1jW81OuBdcrUs9FErSatg0is-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T12:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "South African Crypto Scam Update: A Bashful Bitcoin Fraudster and More than $80m Missing", "text": "It's been nearly three months since news broke of a multi-million-dollar cryptocurrency scam in South Africa. Let's take a look at some of the latest developments.\nIn March of this year, we reported on a massive Ponzi scheme in South Africa which affected nearly 28,000 crypto investors.\nThe company at the center of it all, BTC Global, promised investors ridiculously high returns on their investments and through these promises, managed to scam victims out of more than $50 million as of March. According to Fin24 , this amount has since increased to over $80 million.\nThe Hawks are on the Case South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, have taken over the investigation. A statement by the organization, which investigates issues such as organized- and economic crimes, said:\nThe serious economic offenses unit has been tasked to investigate the massive alleged fraud. Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest, with promises of 2% interest per day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month.\nWill the Real Steven Twain Please Stand Up? There still seems to be some debate as to whether the alleged mastermind of the scheme, Steven Twain, even exists. However, if Cheri Ward is to be believed, he definitely does. Ward was part of a team that helped build a website for Steven and his team to handle customer queries.\nEven though Ward had not physically met with Twain, she had had regular contact with him through email and text. When asked for a photo he replied that he was \"super shy\" and also refused to do a Skype video call.\nA Possible Accomplice in the Scam? On the 25th of May, the Hawks also implicated BitCaw Trading Company as being complicit in the scam, an accusation the latter vehemently denies. A representative for the company said:\n\"BitCaw Trading was not involved in the BTC Global scam and we are shocked to see our name connected with it. BitCaw Trading assists people with buying and selling Bitcoin as well as other Bitcoin-related services. We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment.\"\nBitCaw has subsequently threatened to sue the Hawks for their comments unless a retraction is issued. On Monday, the company's legal team had said that BitCaw is in no way related to BTC Global.\nA letter issued by BitCaw's lawyers state:\n\"BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third-party money or offer any kind of investment returns. BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a Bitcoin investment company and has nothing to do with our client.\"\nAccording to the letter, if a retraction is not made by Tuesday, the legal team's \"instructions are to approach the South Gauteng High Court on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients' rights\".\nStanding Firm However, the Hawks have stated that they will not be swayed and believe that they have sufficient evidence to make these claims against BitCaw. A spokesperson for the Hawks, Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi, said:\nWe got the letter. We knew that they would go to the media. We will take it on in line with the due process. We believe that it is good that people want this to be clarified by the courts, and we will handle it there. As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise.\nWith a crypto con artist playing coy and conflicting stories as to who was actually part of the scam, the Hawks definitely seem to have their work cut out for them.\nDo you think that BitCaw Trading is involved? Will Steven Twain ever show himself?

See How You Can Invest & Start Getting Paid Immediately", "text": "Advertisement: * WE WILL ALSO COACH AND TRAIN YOU\nTo invest money is to put it in a financial scheme or profitable venture with a certainty that it will yield profit within a given time and if you cannot achieve this, then that is not an investment.\nIn a good investment, the term should be short and there should be a possibility of you withdrawing your capital and interest anytime anyday, just incase you have an emergency and that is where www.bitinvestworld.com/free.htm comes in.\nInvestment takes many forms with resulting diverse benefits. A common ground however in each of these many forms is the fact that your yield or profit as the case may be, has a greater potential return on investment if you invest early enough, at a point your profit or interest even becomes more than your capital.\nInvestments are time-based. Hence you need to be time conscious to enjoy the benefits. The following reasons highlight why you should invest your money early enough.\nAnd you are guaranteed between 2% and 20% daily when you invest in www.bitinvestworld.com/free.htm , you might not understand, but imagine investing 1,000 dollars today and getting paid 20% everyday for 10 days that is if you choose to invest for 10 days, you can choose more and you can choose less. Based on our example, it means that by day 10 you would have been paid your 1,000 dollars and another 2,000 dollars interest, making 3,000 dollars in total, this you cannot make even in one year when you deposit in a bank or invest in an unknown investment house\nIf you believe in us and the investment, then register now here http://www.bitinvestworld.com/free.htm\nIf your need to speak to a consultant for any clarification then just send a mail to support@bitinvestworld.com then state your reason for requesting for a phone conversation and you will be given a number to call.\nIf you have any question or advise, then email us on support@bitinvestworld.com\nREQUIREMENTS TO BECOME PART OF THIS\n1. You require an internet connection.\n2. You require a phone that has access to the internet.\n3. You require a Blockchain or bitcoin account, if you do not have one then try www.luno.com or www.localbitcoins.com\n4. You require at least 50 dollars to start investing immediately.\n5. You are good to go and smile to the bank.\nYOU CAN KEEP READING IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION\nYou are a step ahead of others.\nBig things have small beginnings but they also have early starts. The earlier you invest, the better you are in relation to others around you and the edge you have in pursuing your life goals. You will be able to afford your needs when they arise and have little or no financial worries in future compared to people who don’t invest at all or invest later on in life.\nYou can take risks.\nVolatile ventures have been known to yield the highest returns but a major reason you will be willing to invest in these is if you have time on your hands. This is why later investors are usually more careful with their financial investments and so cannot take the needed risks. At the end of the day, they are limited to regular returns because they can only invest in low risk ventures that yield low returns.\nYou increase your yields with compound interests.\nThe interest you get on your interests is compound interest. It increases as you reinvest your yields. Investors that understand the advantages of compound interest invest early so that in the long run their money can earn compound interest.\nYou will be a better spender.\nInvesting early helps you have a disciplined spending habit because you will focus on the long-term benefits of money rather than the short-term benefits this means that you will cut down on impulse buying and save more. Over time, even when you have more money, you will be financially wise because you would have understood the benefits of investing. So, if you have poor spending habits, early investment is the solution for you.\nYou will have a better quality of life.\nInvesting early guarantees a sustainable quality of life for you. You can confidently maintain a certain standard of living and manage your responsibilities. Also, certain life-changing events such as relocation, a temporary unemployment or early retirement will not affect your quality of life.\nWe sometimes wonder what people like you are waiting for and why you have not started earning, always learn to strike when the iron is hot as it is more beneficial. Yes you can call it a risk if you like but have you heard of where anyone made it to the top without taking risks? you either take risk with your life of with your money.\nHonestly bitcoin investment pays, you can do your own research and also ask people like linda ikeji, they also invest on bitcoin, dangote, otedola, bill gates, obasanjo, mark, dino melaye and a host of others are all investing and the good thing is that, you can invest with as little as you can afford.\nWE GUARANTEE YOU OF A 100% REFUND IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU WILL BE SATISFIED AND HAVE NOTHING TO LOOSE, YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO EARN AND EARN AND EARN.\nIT IS FOR EVERYONE,BE YOU A TEACHER OR A BANKER OR A DRIVER,YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEND MORE THAT 2 MINUTES ONLINE DAILY,JUST TO CHECK YOUR PROFIT IF YOU LIKE AND YOU CAN WITHDRAW SAME DAY.\nTHERE IS A SAYING THAT GOES THUS,IF YOU DO NOT INVEST OR HAVE A BUSINESS OF YOUR OWN THEN YOU WILL SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE TAKEN TIME TO START THIER OWN BUSINESS AND THAT IS NOT GOOD.\nNow we have brought an opportunity to you to invest, gone are those days where you will have to raise a huge capital, then rent a shop and then employ workers to work for you ,buy generator and petrol and you are also at the mercy of cheats, fraudsters and armed robbers.

More recently, there has been a shift in the perception of the role it plays in financial activities in a period that has seen government and established financial institutions utilizing blockchain technology internationally.\nBitcoin was introduced as a creation of an individual or individuals who identified as Satoshi Nakamoto, believed to be a pseudonym. The creator never met in person and only communicated publicly through chat rooms and e-mail.\nNakamoto also generated the very first coins mining them on a computer, shortly before releasing the client for public use. Analytics tracking known IPs and Bitcoin addresses also indicate that approximately BTC 1 million were mined by Nakamoto . Most of these have been idling for years in multiple Bitcoin addresses, with some addresses still receiving anonymous donations to this day .\nIf assumptions are correct that these belong to Nakamoto exist and will never be released, this means that almost 5% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply will never be in circulation. The potential for this vast sum to destabilize the market should it ever be released has generated a huge amount of interest in discovering the identity and motivations of Satoshi Nakamoto. Conspiracies and claims\nAs with any mystery, Bitcoin’s creation has had its fair share of conspiracy theories. Among the most outlandish was a suggestion that aliens introduced blockchain technology. The underlying cryptography has also led some to believe there was CIA involvement, with Bitcoin’s potential for communications utility and funding arrangements for special operations.\nEven corporate links have been fingered. Parts of the names of four major corporations – Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi, and Motorola – form the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\nOther individuals have been considered as prospects. In March 2014, journalist Leah McGrath Goodman gathered evidence that pointed to a system engineer who had worked on defense projects as Nakamoto. He denied any involvement and Goodman’s news story was roundly criticized for her questionable methodology.\nAt the end of 2015, investigations by Gizmodo and Wired discovered evidence that an Australian, Craig Wright, and an American, Dave Kleiman (who had died in 2013), could have developed Bitcoin . Wright supported this claim in May 2016 but the evidence was not conclusive.\nOthers with extensive blockchain knowledge have also been linked. Nick Szabo’s ‘bit gold’ which was created in 1998, has been considered to be the original concept for creating Bitcoin. Szabo has not confirmed any of the speculation.\nFor now, the identity of the creator remains unknown and 1 million Bitcoins sit untouched.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://blockchain.info/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa", "https://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692?rev=1449615811696", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/satoshi-s-fortune-a-more-accurate-figure/", "https://bitcoinnews.com/what-is-bitcoin/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/07/real-bitcoin-creator-i-am-not-dorian-nakamoto.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T14:26:23.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b67c37d6710d84c1ec7cfde285b89da9cdf9190f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfhGmLoaRwJ4nTdquRdf_SKHrYrVaFzF5kshoAulet3VU8ppnHFmcx1Tyon38DfTLo5lAU3LsSz9JSi3FsBAd5LFbpWZNfTa8-", "site_full": "cmsthemespluginstemplates.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://cmsthemespluginstemplates.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "CMS Themes Plugins Templates", "title": "Keyptochain- Bitcoin PSD Template (PSD Templates) download", "title_full": "Keyptochain- Bitcoin PSD Template (PSD Templates) download", "published": "2018-05-29T12:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b67c37d6710d84c1ec7cfde285b89da9cdf9190f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfhGmLoaRwJ4nTdquRdf_SKHrYrVaFzF5kshoAulet3VU8ppnHFmcx1Tyon38DfTLo5lAU3LsSz9JSi3FsBAd5LFbpWZNfTa8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cosma Dan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T12:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Keyptochain- Bitcoin PSD Template (PSD Templates) download", "text": "\nIn the purchased package, we will include PSD folder (08 psd files) and documentation folder.

The digital coin finished the day at $7,135.99, significantly lower than its opening price of $7,371.31.\nFollowing the disappointing finish on Monday, Bitcoin had to endure some rocky trading in the early hours of today’s session. However, the cryptocurrency has so far managed to defend the $7,000 level, even though it hit a near seven-week low of $7,090.68 shortly after the start of today’s trading. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $7,150, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nBitcoin’s lacklustre performance reflects a larger downtrend observed across the cryptocurrency market. Major Bitcoin rivals such as Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have all seen losses over the past 24 hours, with Cardano (ADA) being the only top 10 digital coin that has enjoyed gains in that period. The size of the cryptocurrency market has shrunk to just over $306 billion, from $313 billion 24 hours ago.\nThe downbeat trend, which persisted throughout the entirety of last week, was in part fuelled by news about increased regulatory pressure in the US. A Bloomberg report published last Thursday stated that The US Department of Justice had opened an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The DoJ was working with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate illegal practices such as spoofing and wash trading, the newswire said, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,155.96, as of 10:05 BST. The digital coin has lost 1.2% of its value in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:36:18.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f86609b6ae7178a0f899314b3515c98d64d803f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__337i_vK9yYJv3NJZ8geNkyxs22X3NR2.I4TT80lkXwZs6ryaJNVLJR1Vl3Y8VyP2pw--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague’s Subway System", "title_full": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague’s Subway System", "published": "2018-05-29T12:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f86609b6ae7178a0f899314b3515c98d64d803f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__337i_vK9yYJv3NJZ8geNkyxs22X3NR2.I4TT80lkXwZs6ryaJNVLJR1Vl3Y8VyP2pw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T12:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague’s Subway System", "text": "Home » bitcoin news » Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague’s Subway System Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague’s Subway System bitcoin news #bitcoin # invest #money\nThe cryptocurrency industry keeps expanding all over the world, and Czechia is giving an important step. One of the most important ATM manufacturers in the world, known as General Bytes, installed ten Bitcoin ATMs in Prague’s metro. Prague Installs 10 New Bitcoin AMTs\nAccording to an official statement released by General Bytes Service, the company will install ten new crypto ATMs in Prague’s subway system. The metro transports over 1.6 million individuals per day, being one of the busiest metro systems in Europe.\nNow it will be possible to buy Bitcoin in many different locations, including these stops: Mustek, Nadrazí Veleslavín, Dejvicka, Florenc, Cerny Most, Zlicín, Pankrac, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nadrazí.\nPrague and Czechia are important cryptocurrency hubs in the region. These are not the first virtual currency ATMs installed, and there is a very active cryptocurrency community in the place. For example, it has a Bitcoin Coffee shop and other related attractions.\nAn important e-commerce company, Alza, added support to cryptocurrencies on tis platform and installed two BTC ATMs in its showroom.\nGeneral Bytes is a company that specializes in Android and Bitcoin, and is located in Czechia. The two machines offered by the company are BATMTwo and BATMThree based on Android. They offer the possibility for clients to register they data, including email address and other important documents like IDs. Argentina May Install 4000 to 5000 Bitcoin ATMs\nOther countries around the world are also very interested in virtual currencies. This is the case of Argentina, that will see an important expansion of crypto ATMs in its territory. An American-Argentine company located in the US wants to install between 4,000 to 5,000 BTC ATMs.\nSebastián Ponceliz, CEO and founder of Odyssey Group, said :\n“These will not only be Cash Machines for people to extract cash; they will also be used to issue prepaid cards, as e-commerce platform, to make transfers through blockchain cryptocurrencies, and linking micro sourcing for micro credits.” Czech Utility Company Starts Accepting Crypto Payments\nOne of the most important Czech utility companies, Pražská Plynárenská, started to accept virtual currency payments for the services it offers. The main intention is to attract younger generations of customers that may be ready to pay in cryptocurrencies.\nPavel Janeček, Chief Executive Officer of the company, commented:\n“In June, we are opening a payment gateway, which will automatically transfer our bitcoin payments into regular currency, so that we don’t have to speculate with cryptocurrency. But if anyone wants to pay in an alternative way, we want to allow them to do that.”\nJoin the conversation over at Telegram ( https://t.me/coinstaker )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.coinstaker.com/czech-utility-company-accepts-cryptocurrencies/", "https://www.coinstaker.com/georgia-cryptocurrencies-atm-litecoin-bitcoin/", "https://t.me/coinstaker", "https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/koncepty/bitcoin-coffee-en/", "https://services.generalbytes.com/cs/", "https://cryptstorm.com/2018/04/30/argentina-ready-install-crypto-atms/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nadrazí veleslavín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cerny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hlavní nadrazí", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skalka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new bitcoin atm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague installs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general bytes service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czechia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejvicka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zlicín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankrac", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:45:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab52e8686aeba1cda1e43fedf676b891ab1ab821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYW8YjggBtqdAHvU_.1FYuQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "title_full": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "published": "2018-05-29T12:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.069, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab52e8686aeba1cda1e43fedf676b891ab1ab821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYW8YjggBtqdAHvU_.1FYuQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VeronAncient", "published": "2018-05-29T12:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "text": "they've been keeping their usernames and passwords tight and making passwords that are so hard to hack. and they keep the assets in the account is not much, just for investment or trade. the rest they keep in the existing bank account.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:21:57.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12aa1aad49226ad86300d6de4e2d1b8c68501c73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C0NXQqaHDDuNDv5Vf5RHs.zFLILoqGdnLQ--", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "https://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion @ Forex Factory", "title": "Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile 7", "title_full": "Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile -

Let’s take a look at some of the latest developments.\nIn March of this year, we reported on a massive Ponzi scheme in South Africa which affected nearly 28,000 crypto investors.\nThe company at the center of it all, BTC Global, promised investors ridiculously high returns on their investments and through these promises, managed to scam victims out of more than $50 million as of March. According to Fin24 , this amount has since increased to over $80 million. The Hawks are on the Case\nSouth Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, have taken over the investigation. A statement by the organization, which investigates issues such as organized- and economic crimes, said:\nThe serious economic offenses unit has been tasked to investigate the massive alleged fraud. Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest, with promises of 2% interest per day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month. Will the Real Steven Twain Please Stand Up?\nThere still seems to be some debate as to whether the alleged mastermind of the scheme, Steven Twain, even exists. However, if Cheri Ward is to be believed, he definitely does. Ward was part of a team that helped build a website for Steven and his team to handle customer queries.\nEven though Ward had not physically met with Twain, she had had regular contact with him through email and text. When asked for a photo he replied that he was “super shy” and also refused to do a Skype video call. A Possible Accomplice in the Scam?\nOn the 25th of May, the Hawks also implicated BitCaw Trading Company as being complicit in the scam, an accusation the latter vehemently denies. A representative for the company said:\n“BitCaw Trading was not involved in the BTC Global scam and we are shocked to see our name connected with it. BitCaw Trading assists people with buying and selling Bitcoin as well as other Bitcoin-related services. We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment.”\nBitCaw has subsequently threatened to sue the Hawks for their comments unless a retraction is issued. On Monday, the company’s legal team had said that BitCaw is in no way related to BTC Global.\nA letter issued by BitCaw’s lawyers state:\n“BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third-party money or offer any kind of investment returns. BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a Bitcoin investment company and has nothing to do with our client.”\nAccording to the letter, if a retraction is not made by Tuesday, the legal team’s “instructions are to approach the South Gauteng High Court on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients’ rights”. Standing Firm\nHowever, the Hawks have stated that they will not be swayed and believe that they have sufficient evidence to make these claims against BitCaw. A spokesperson for the Hawks, Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi, said:\nWe got the letter. We knew that they would go to the media. We will take it on in line with the due process. We believe that it is good that people want this to be clarified by the courts, and we will handle it there. As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise.\nWith a crypto con artist playing coy and conflicting stories as to who was actually part of the scam, the Hawks definitely seem to have their work cut out for them.\nDo you think that BitCaw Trading is involved?

However, a corrective rally remained elusive as bitcoin ran into offers above $7,400 and closed (as per UTC) at $7,143 – the lowest daily close since April 12, according to Bitfinex.\nPrices continued to drop today, with bitcoin hitting a 7-week low of $7,040 this morning. At time of writing, the price was at $7,130.\nThe losses signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900 – a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost. If they can't, prices may go as low as $5,000. Daily chart\nBTC created a bearish outside-day candle on Monday. These occur when a high is above the previous day's high and the low is below the previous day's low. In simple terms, it means trading on Monday started with optimism and ended with pessimism.\nThe bearish outside-day usually indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change. However, when viewed against the backdrop of Sunday's doji candle, the bearish outside-day signals revival/continuation of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990.\nThe above chart also shows the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are trending south in favor of the bears.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to 30.00, indicating oversold conditions.\nAccording to historical data , bitcoin climbs every time the RSI on the daily chart drops to or below 30.00. However, the historical pattern may not come into play this time, as BTC's long-term technical studies have turned in favor of the bears.\nFor instance, the weekly RSI is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory). Further, BTC recently closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since 2015, adding credence to the argument the long-run bull market is over. Meanwhile, the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears.\nAs a result, it's likely that BTC will drop to $6,900 (triangle support) soon – although it may not happen in the next 24 hours as the short-duration chart shows a temporary bullish setup. 1-hour chart\nBTC has created lower lows in the last 48 hours, but the RSI has not followed suit – a bullish divergence that indicates scope for a minor corrective rally. View BTC will likely drop to $6,900 (triangle support). This is the last line of defense for the bulls. A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,900 would open the doors to $5,400 (November 2017 low). A minor corrective rally to $7,300 could be in the offing, but will likely be short-lived. A break above the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,702 would abort the bearish view. Only a convincing move above $9,990 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Yet has since found the going challenging and once again trading below its 20 (yellow line) and 200 (red line) day moving averages, while BCH attempts to hold the line at its 50DMA (blue line) as we can witness in the Chart below:\nAs we can observe from the daily chart above, BCH finds itself trading beneath its 20 and 200DMA’s and attempting to maintain its 50DMA. In addition, we can also see that BCH presently resides in a former congestion zone from the February through early March time-frame within the shaded area acting as potential support.\nWhile BCH has yet to violate short-term support located at the 1128 level, when weighing all of the evidence taking place, such as trading below both its 20 and 200DMA’s as well as the overall market climate, the likelihood of BCH breaching its 50DMA and testing the 1128 figure remains a viable possibility and probability particularly with cryptocurrency conditions as slippery as they are at present.\nWhen zooming-out to the Weekly Chart above, we can also observe that BCH is trading within a triangle formation and perhaps more importantly, just how critical the 1128 potential support level is as it dates back to the week of 11/20/17.\nTaking all of the above into consideration, both the action on the daily and weekly time-frames (charts), both investors and traders alike may want to pay close attention to the action in BCH moving forward.\nWith that said, let’s take a closer look at specific levels that may provide further clues/evidence in order to ascertain which direction BCH may have in store in the forthcoming days/weeks ahead.\nIf, at any time in the days ahead BCH is unable to hold its 50DMA, which as of this writing, finds itself ticking slightly below, the probability of a test at the aforementioned potential support level of 1128 would certainly come into ‘play’.\nShould the 1128 level ‘give way’ at any time in the days/weeks ahead, such development, should it materialize, would be extremely concerning as that would likely set the stage for a possible move into Tier II support, which can be found at the 950-1000 zone.\nHowever, should BCH be capable of holding both its 50DMA (1162) and staving off a test of the 1128 level as well and can turn the tides north, a move that clears the 1313 and perhaps more importantly, the 1357 figure, would surely be an encouraging step from a short-term perspective, in righting the ship.\nNevertheless, BCH presently finds itself, as do many in the cryptocurrency universe, at a key inflection point attempting to stem the bleed lower. As the saying goes, “Nothing good happens below the 200-day moving average”, and that’s precisely where we find numerous names presently residing.\nHappy Trading!!\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Emergency sales are usually reserved for perishable goods, such as food, or items that typically depreciate in value, such as cars.\nThe cryptocurrencies that were sold--1,312 Bitcoins, 1,399 Bitcoin Cash tokens, 1,312 Bitcoin Gold tokens and 220 Ether--were mostly seized in a crackdown on a platform called LuL.to, which was illegally selling copyrighted ebooks and audiobooks at very low prices. The site was seized and blocked last June, its operators were arrested and its assets went into a fund that is typically used for police resourcing.\nThe sale took place over a couple of months, in a series of more than 1,600 transactions on a German cryptocurrency trading platform. According to Der Tagesspiegel , the proceeds totalled just over EUR12 million ($13.9 million.)\nThe selloff began in late February, when the price of one Bitcoin had crashed from its December highs --almost $20,000--to around $11,400. Over the course of the sale, the price dipped below $7,000 and cleared $9,000 again. Since then, it has fallen again to a price of $7,230, so the cops’ timing looks pretty good for now, unless Bitcoin makes a surprising rebound in the near future.\nThis was a record-breaking sale of seized assets within Germany, but American authorities have been making more money off seized cryptocurrencies for a while. The Justice Department got $48 million in October last year from the sale of Bitcoins that came from Ross “Dread Pirate Roberts” Ulbricht. The sale actually took place a couple years earlier, when one Bitcoin was worth a mere $330 or so, but Ulbricht, the operator of the Silk Road online drug market, had challenged the legality of the forfeiture and took a while to drop his claim.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2018/05/25/bitcoin-future-price-invest/", "http://fortune.com/2017/10/02/bitcoin-sale-silk-road/", "https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/internetkriminalitaet-bayern-verkauft-bitcoin-fuer-12-millionen-euro/22611878.html", "http://fortune.com/2018/05/29/germany-seized-bitcoin-emergency-sale/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "der tagesspiegel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tagesspiegel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:48:18.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fc0746d4171f7cbd3f98e073a0744988357037b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vjYuvkxzlLtydLzDP7eVcDY-", "site_full": "mybroadband.co.za", "site": "mybroadband.co.za", "site_section": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/forumdisplay.php/92-Broadband-and-IT-News", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Broadband and IT News", "title": "Bitcaw Trading denies any links to R1 billion Bitcoin scam being investigated by the", "title_full": "Bitcaw Trading denies any links to R1 billion Bitcoin scam being investigated by the", "published": "2018-05-29T11:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/images/misc/facebook_share.jpg?v=1.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5974, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9fc0746d4171f7cbd3f98e073a0744988357037b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vjYuvkxzlLtydLzDP7eVcDY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BusinessTech", "published": "2018-05-29T11:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcaw Trading denies any links to R1 billion Bitcoin scam being investigated by the", "text": "Bitcaw Trading denies any links to R1 billion Bitcoin scam being investigated by the Hawks\nBitcaw Trading Company has refuted all links to an alleged Bitcoin scam being run by an entity identified by the Hawks as BTC Global.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://businesstech.co.za/news/banking/247929/bitcaw-trading-denies-any-links-to-r1-billion-bitcoin-scam-being-investigated-by-the-hawks/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T11:57:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d42d223936d9503d197213bf21595bb2c43bfdb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Ll6t_zRz9WP4xpTSUvjxnBu0cNGH5Md9yLT9qYoBrou7zRO1kTnWQ.jKQXPsZEsxvFV8tzH7EwjsC0thkxcytUH.5jKBxhcXSyA0UeRPHRoDhdqQw31mJVQVOq2y0MFT7u2_a4D6BPNg--", "site_full": "ewn.co.za", "site": "ewn.co.za", "site_section": "http://ewn.co.za/RSS Feeds/Latest News", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Eyewitness News | Latest News", "title": "Looking for new way to donate during Ramadan?

London mosque now accepts bitcoin Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5% of their wealth. Picture: AFP Tweet Reuters | one day ago\nLONDON – Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin .\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5% of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

There is much speculation as to whether Satoshi is an actual person, or a collection of individuals using a pseudonym for a consortium of cypherpunk developers that designed wrote and tested the Bitcoin experiment. The background of Bitcoin Created in 2009, Bitcoin is a digital currency introduced as open source software by MIT student, Satoshi Nakamoto. On November 2008, a whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” authored by Satoshi was posted to a cryptography mailing list, sparking the first ever mention of Bitcoin. In January 2009, the bitcoin network was established after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, the first ever block on the chain. Since the inception of bitcoin, the currency has peaked at $19,140.70 USD. What was the vision of Bitcoin – Decentralized financial system nondependent on banks and corporations Bitcoin is built on the notion that money is any object or record, that is accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic grouping. To control the creation and transfer of money, Bitcoin uses cryptography, or mathematical equations rather than relying on governments or central banking authorities. Transfers for loans, sales, purchases or any other methods of payment can be processed by anybody, using a desktop, smart phone, tablet, or laptop. This is all possible without the need for a financial institution to act as an intermediary or recording agent. Bitcoin is not just money for the internet; it is a programming language that allows for the decentralization of any information system. In order to understand this let’s use the analogy of the internet; which allows any individual admission to a global communication and information network instantaneously. In this same way, Bitcoin is allowing individuals’ instant access to a free global financial network. The implication of a decentralized financial network free from the corruption of third party moderators is overwhelming. Ponder for a moment introducing 7 billion potential consumers to the global marketplace. The possibilities for economic growth and innovation are exponential. This exists because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, chose to create open source software that gave all users equal say. The power of the Bitcoin network is its users, which currently exceeds the combined computing power of the top 600 super computers on Earth. This equates to a network, which is for all intents of purposes, impenetrable. Essentially, each individual computer acts as a voting node. The validity of the current Bitcoin equation, otherwise known as the block chain, is then determined by the nodes. In order for the block chain to be verified, a majority of the voting nodes must corroborate if the equation is done correctly. This process happens in nanoseconds, meaning not all voting nodes will participate in every given block chain verification. The Bitcoin protocol not only has the power to shape and influence the future of our global financial network, but also of our voting, our phones, and our cable television. The Bitcoin software can be implemented into any system that is based on an unbiased third-party mediator. As the software is policed by all participating members, the possibility of corruption, or hacking the system is minuscule. Regardless of whether or not the Bitcoin currency ever turns into a legitimate mainstream form of monetary transaction remains to be seen, however the revolution in software that Nakamoto has unleashed has only just begun. What is a God Protocol – Nick Szabo idea Imagine a financial system controlled by AI, barred from government or corporation interventions. This would represent everyone in an ideal system in which there is no third-party manipulation. In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called “Bit Gold”. Bit Gold was never implemented but has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Based on the words of Nick Szabo, third trusted parties are security holes. When a protocol relies on third trusted parties, it has to patch the security holes that the mere centralization creates and that can be fairly costly. What is Faythe, the first god protocol Introducing Faythe, the first god protocol – an anonymous decentralized movement with human trusted third parties where those parties provide insight or knowledge that cannot be provided by a computer. Faythe aims to fight cryptocurrency censorship, public manipulation and corporations forcing governments to protect them against decentralization. Faythe is currently in pre-ico stage and is open to contributions. Anyone can contribute or join the project, and early contributors will receive FAYTHE tokens as a bonus which can be exchanged for FAYTHE coins after the Faythe public release. Faythe in the vision of SN for the future Satoshi envisioned a payment system that was faster, cheaper and irreversible. No financial institution needed. Nor did it need a 3rd party to mediate conflicts either. “ A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution .’’– Satoshi Nakamoto. Decentralization makes sense; the idea of sending payments without going through a financial institution is what Satoshi envisioned. Now that Bitcoin has been in existence for more than nine years, its strengths have been revealed. For a project that was initially ignored and then mocked by the financial world, Bitcoin is amazingly resilient. Bitcoin has demonstrated to the world that blockchain technology works, and, for certain use cases, works amazingly well. It has solved the problem of exchanging money between strangers without resorting to a third party. Blockchain transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional models due to it’s irreversible nature, making it safer and more convenient for online payments. Those of us who have been involved in Bitcoin for years should step back every once in a while, and marvel at its capabilities. It is truly a technological and economic miracle. However Faythe is about to solve one of the biggest problems that the original blockchain didn’t. Faythe will control the ins and outs and will be able to bridge blockchains in a way that will make everything be able to operate as a complete financial system. The Faythe Alpha Net is already being tested and multiple participants will join before the end of the year.\nMedia Contact", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T12:18:43.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15f97b198eace0206a717e0ac065d4101147761a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg88.dDxm4.x9cnYwan6kKowCnRl9OIsoprxNjv3LkBoJL894Uc_sirjk1IC_mor6KasXMBMSdJvACm.2un8pKHJxGIOCm0xx7DFT4ryswmCq7y1WpwbD228qdCOIl.dkwZ.hWzYOGe62yVHpeG2e_8I", "site_full": "www.alaskanewsdesk.com", "site": "alaskanewsdesk.com", "site_section": "http://www.alaskanewsdesk.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alaska News Desk", "title": "What is Satoshi Nakamoto doing 10 years after Bitcoin was launched?", "title_full": "What is Satoshi Nakamoto doing 10 years after Bitcoin was launched?", "published": "2018-05-29T11:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15f97b198eace0206a717e0ac065d4101147761a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg88.dDxm4.x9cnYwan6kKowCnRl9OIsoprxNjv3LkBoJL894Uc_sirjk1IC_mor6KasXMBMSdJvACm.2un8pKHJxGIOCm0xx7DFT4ryswmCq7y1WpwbD228qdCOIl.dkwZ.hWzYOGe62yVHpeG2e_8I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-29T11:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is Satoshi Nakamoto doing 10 years after Bitcoin was launched?", "text": "Print This Article Share it With Friends One of the technological world’s biggest mystery to this day, is the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the computer programmer (or programmers) who created and developed the digital currency known as Bitcoin.

This is all possible without the need for a financial institution to act as an intermediary or recording agent. Bitcoin is not just money for the internet; it is a programming language that allows for the decentralization of any information system. In order to understand this let’s use the analogy of the internet; which allows any individual admission to a global communication and information network instantaneously. In this same way, Bitcoin is allowing individuals’ instant access to a free global financial network. The implication of a decentralized financial network free from the corruption of third party moderators is overwhelming. Ponder for a moment introducing 7 billion potential consumers to the global marketplace. The possibilities for economic growth and innovation are exponential. This exists because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, chose to create open source software that gave all users equal say. The power of the Bitcoin network is its users, which currently exceeds the combined computing power of the top 600 super computers on Earth. This equates to a network, which is for all intents of purposes, impenetrable. Essentially, each individual computer acts as a voting node. The validity of the current Bitcoin equation, otherwise known as the block chain, is then determined by the nodes. In order for the block chain to be verified, a majority of the voting nodes must corroborate if the equation is done correctly. This process happens in nanoseconds, meaning not all voting nodes will participate in every given block chain verification. The Bitcoin protocol not only has the power to shape and influence the future of our global financial network, but also of our voting, our phones, and our cable television. The Bitcoin software can be implemented into any system that is based on an unbiased third-party mediator. As the software is policed by all participating members, the possibility of corruption, or hacking the system is minuscule. Regardless of whether or not the Bitcoin currency ever turns into a legitimate mainstream form of monetary transaction remains to be seen, however the revolution in software that Nakamoto has unleashed has only just begun. What is a God Protocol – Nick Szabo idea Imagine a financial system controlled by AI, barred from government or corporation interventions. This would represent everyone in an ideal system in which there is no third-party manipulation. In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called “Bit Gold”. Bit Gold was never implemented but has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Based on the words of Nick Szabo, third trusted parties are security holes. When a protocol relies on third trusted parties, it has to patch the security holes that the mere centralization creates and that can be fairly costly. What is Faythe, the first god protocol Introducing Faythe, the first god protocol – an anonymous decentralized movement with human trusted third parties where those parties provide insight or knowledge that cannot be provided by a computer. Faythe aims to fight cryptocurrency censorship, public manipulation and corporations forcing governments to protect them against decentralization. Faythe is currently in pre-ico stage and is open to contributions. Anyone can contribute or join the project, and early contributors will receive FAYTHE tokens as a bonus which can be exchanged for FAYTHE coins after the Faythe public release. Faythe in the vision of SN for the future Satoshi envisioned a payment system that was faster, cheaper and irreversible. No financial institution needed. Nor did it need a 3rd party to mediate conflicts either. “ A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution .’’– Satoshi Nakamoto. Decentralization makes sense; the idea of sending payments without going through a financial institution is what Satoshi envisioned. Now that Bitcoin has been in existence for more than nine years, its strengths have been revealed. For a project that was initially ignored and then mocked by the financial world, Bitcoin is amazingly resilient. Bitcoin has demonstrated to the world that blockchain technology works, and, for certain use cases, works amazingly well. It has solved the problem of exchanging money between strangers without resorting to a third party. Blockchain transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional models due to it’s irreversible nature, making it safer and more convenient for online payments. Those of us who have been involved in Bitcoin for years should step back every once in a while, and marvel at its capabilities. It is truly a technological and economic miracle. However Faythe is about to solve one of the biggest problems that the original blockchain didn’t. Faythe will control the ins and outs and will be able to bridge blockchains in a way that will make everything be able to operate as a complete financial system.

Ponder for a moment introducing 7 billion potential consumers to the global marketplace. The possibilities for economic growth and innovation are exponential. This exists because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, chose to create open source software that gave all users equal say. The power of the Bitcoin network is its users, which currently exceeds the combined computing power of the top 600 super computers on Earth. This equates to a network, which is for all intents of purposes, impenetrable. Essentially, each individual computer acts as a voting node. The validity of the current Bitcoin equation, otherwise known as the block chain, is then determined by the nodes. In order for the block chain to be verified, a majority of the voting nodes must corroborate if the equation is done correctly. This process happens in nanoseconds, meaning not all voting nodes will participate in every given block chain verification. The Bitcoin protocol not only has the power to shape and influence the future of our global financial network, but also of our voting, our phones, and our cable television. The Bitcoin software can be implemented into any system that is based on an unbiased third-party mediator. As the software is policed by all participating members, the possibility of corruption, or hacking the system is minuscule. Regardless of whether or not the Bitcoin currency ever turns into a legitimate mainstream form of monetary transaction remains to be seen, however the revolution in software that Nakamoto has unleashed has only just begun. What is a God Protocol – Nick Szabo idea Imagine a financial system controlled by AI, barred from government or corporation interventions. This would represent everyone in an ideal system in which there is no third-party manipulation. In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called “Bit Gold”. Bit Gold was never implemented but has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Based on the words of Nick Szabo, third trusted parties are security holes. When a protocol relies on third trusted parties, it has to patch the security holes that the mere centralization creates and that can be fairly costly. What is Faythe, the first god protocol Introducing Faythe, the first god protocol – an anonymous decentralized movement with human trusted third parties where those parties provide insight or knowledge that cannot be provided by a computer. Faythe aims to fight cryptocurrency censorship, public manipulation and corporations forcing governments to protect them against decentralization. Faythe is currently in pre-ico stage and is open to contributions. Anyone can contribute or join the project, and early contributors will receive FAYTHE tokens as a bonus which can be exchanged for FAYTHE coins after the Faythe public release. Faythe in the vision of SN for the future Satoshi envisioned a payment system that was faster, cheaper and irreversible. No financial institution needed. Nor did it need a 3rd party to mediate conflicts either. “ A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution .’’– Satoshi Nakamoto. Decentralization makes sense; the idea of sending payments without going through a financial institution is what Satoshi envisioned. Now that Bitcoin has been in existence for more than nine years, its strengths have been revealed. For a project that was initially ignored and then mocked by the financial world, Bitcoin is amazingly resilient. Bitcoin has demonstrated to the world that blockchain technology works, and, for certain use cases, works amazingly well. It has solved the problem of exchanging money between strangers without resorting to a third party. Blockchain transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional models due to it’s irreversible nature, making it safer and more convenient for online payments. Those of us who have been involved in Bitcoin for years should step back every once in a while, and marvel at its capabilities. It is truly a technological and economic miracle. However Faythe is about to solve one of the biggest problems that the original blockchain didn’t. Faythe will control the ins and outs and will be able to bridge blockchains in a way that will make everything be able to operate as a complete financial system. The Faythe Alpha Net is already being tested and multiple participants will join before the end of the year.\nMedia Contact", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T11:42:22.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fe6ec882fbc2ce8dfc5be1c6352c597164d2cf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhNeITFt.yWbXBchN1Cu3rF0-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T11:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fe6ec882fbc2ce8dfc5be1c6352c597164d2cf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhNeITFt.yWbXBchN1Cu3rF0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T11:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 29, 2018 NEWS Asian Cryptocurrency Trading Roundup: Bitcoin Dominance Approaches 40% as Altcoins Bleed newsBTC Bitcoin has floundered again losing 3% on the day and falling to $7,150.

What I'm thinking now is Bitcoin and Eherum both show good prospects in the digital currency financial system. With marketcap and high transaction volumes both of them earn very good trust from the public.\nThe current problem is that we can all make governments ease the rules they make, as far as possible there should be regulations regulating the circulation of crypto.

The SAPS unit identified the alleged perpetrators as “Bitcaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global”.\nHowever, Bitcaw Trading has now hit back at the police unit, saying that it is in no way affiliated with BTC, and requested that the statement be retracted.\n“While we appreciate that the Hawks are investigating BTC Global and the circumstances around the ‘investment opportunity”’ which folded earlier this year, we must clarify that BitCaw Trading is in no way related to BTC Global. Naming them as the same company has already had significant implications for the trustworthy and respected BitCaw Trading,” said Bitcaw MD, Andrew Caw.\nAccording to Caw, BitCaw Trading is a legitimate operation that has assisted hundreds of people with buying and selling Bitcoin, while educating its clients on the basics of the cryptocurrency.\n“BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third party money or offer any kind of investment returns. BitCaw has publicly taught clients how to avoid online scams,” Caw said.\nBTC Global, meanwhile, was a questionable ‘Investment company’, based on a US Dollar investment, fronted in bitcoin by a relatively unknown man based in the United States, he said.\nHawks retraction\nIt was reported on Monday (28 May) that Bitcaw had sent a letter of demand to the Hawks, seeking for the unit’s statement to be withdrawn, or to have the matter taken to court.\nAccording to Caw, the Hawks nor any of the investigators involved had ever made contact with his company, and to-date, still has not, instead choosing to make statements to the media.\n“For a small business built on trust and reputation this has caused significant damage to us. In addition, this action has effectively shut down our new product launch which we have had to shelve after our financial services provider (FSP) partner has been forced by their internal policies to withdraw their support,” he said.\n“Our legal team have requested that the Hawks retract the incorrect reference to BitCaw Trading in relation to their investigation, but the officers have apparently refused, again to the media without communicating with us directly.”\nSpeaking to Fin24 , Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi said that the unit has received Bitcaw’s letter of demand, but would not retract the statement. The unit, he said, will wait for the courts to make a ruling on the matter, rather than retract a statement prematurely.\n“As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise,” Mulaudzi said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mg.co.za/article/2018-05-28-company-probed-for-bitcoin-scam-threatens-to-sue-hawks"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew caw", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcaw trading company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcaw trading", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T13:40:03.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "643bdc67495c436d18371a911ce77c32bb611f05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6mRu5zEgZC2pPftC0tBh4ytTIiz9S6OcsFvFZBlqfKssOb8hMUS6gjYGHI24O9N0Dp5PFiwOZiyTsX2Tk5X18eLuST9gkwSHbctzsGg3YhBVg--", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News – Bitcoin Core, Crypto Addiction, and Poloniex Drama", "title_full": "Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News – Bitcoin Core, Crypto Addiction, and Poloniex Drama", "published": "2018-05-29T11:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-2134.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "643bdc67495c436d18371a911ce77c32bb611f05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6mRu5zEgZC2pPftC0tBh4ytTIiz9S6OcsFvFZBlqfKssOb8hMUS6gjYGHI24O9N0Dp5PFiwOZiyTsX2Tk5X18eLuST9gkwSHbctzsGg3YhBVg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-29T11:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News – Bitcoin Core, Crypto Addiction, and Poloniex Drama", "text": "E-mail thecryptolark@gmail.com with business or event enquiries.\nDISCLAIMER Everything expressed here is my opinion and not official investment advice – please do your own research before risking your own money.\nThanks for watching; please like, subscribe, and share if you found this useful!

A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation – in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s … accepted by a group of people …. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

currency, Blockchain With Robo-Advisors in Bitcoin to invest – a Blockchain-Center-Seminar\n24. May the Blockchain Center of the Frankfurt School of Finance organised a Seminar on the topic of institutional Investments in crypto-currencies. Various speakers considered the opportunities that arise with crypto-currencies for Fund managers and investors. In addition to issues related to the safekeeping of Bitcoins, the capabilities of Robo-Advisors, and Machine Learning in the crypto sector have been discussed.\nThe Frankfurt School of Finance is many with your Blockchain Center. Since the end of 2016, the to Professor Philipp Sandner organized a think-tank organized Meetups, writes a Paper and organized a recent conference on crypto-Assets. Over the last BTC has been reported ECHO.\n24. May the Blockchain Center of the Frankfurt School of Finance organised a Workshop on crypto funds. In cooperation with Dechert LLP, the possibilities should be discussed, which brings the new Asset class of crypto-currencies for the Fund Manager.\nPhilipp Sandner has emphasized this point in a short pulse lecture. He claimed that especially in the case of banks, known as the “Blockchain vs. Bitcoin”Position innovation is back, as technological innovations came primarily from Start-ups in the crypto-Ecosystem. He is convinced that in ten years, almost all financial transactions are based on the Blockchain. As examples of already implemented use cases in the context of the asset management Sandner Arbitrage called-shops and ICOs specialized funds. Crypto-currencies for Robo Advisors – a missing piece of the puzzle?\nIn the first lecture, Christian Labetzsch of Blocksize Capital introduced into the world of Robo Advisors. Robo Advisors are – to put it simply, virtual assistants, and financial advisors. On the Basis of questionnaires recorded customer data, they automatically create risk profiles, and a matching Portfolio. Specifically, it is possible to distinguish between the Online Advisory Tools, such as easy folio and individual asset management, such as investify. An Overview of existing systems roboverleich.com. Of course, here as in the area of other virtual assistants very much. Work is the use of Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing.\nThe rally of 2017 currencies of great interest on the part of asset managers to Bitcoin and other Crypto. In fact, could be established for Robo-Advisors, the consideration of crypto-Assets to be a Key Differentiator. In addition, Robo could facilitate-Advisors and investment advisors in General, the investors get started in crypto currencies. As a regulatory solution is not here yet, can Robo-Advisors, if you are raised as a regulated Investment vehicles, crypto-currencies do not integrate directly.\nHowever, beyond this fully regulated financial products in different Robo exist-Advisors in the crypto-Ecosystem. As examples RoboAdvisorCoin, NaPoleonX, SwissBorg, MelonPort and ICONOMI. With KI for the optimal crypto-financial management\nIn the second lecture, Christoph Impekoven, also of Blocksize Capital currencies, the topics of complex Cryptographic and artificial intelligence are discussed.\nHe found that Blocksize Capital developed a System, which is dominated to a algorithmic Trading, Arbitrage between different stock exchanges taken into account. A special area of their activity the algorithmic Trading to liquidity optimization. In particular, in the case of large sums of money, the lack of liquidity can be a Problem. It should be on the assessment of the liquidity of a Slicing of buy and sell orders, which is no negative traces in the market. You realize this focus on liquidity, Blocksize Capital thinks of large customers.\nIn the lecture, the larger context was considered: Impekoven showed that there is in the area of artificial intelligence, various projects. Numerai, Cindicator and BittsAnalytics are only mentioned as examples.\nNumerai sees itself as a crowd-funded hedge Fund with a right of co-determination. Users of Machine-Learning will be able to submit models for algorithmic Trading. Weekly competitions are held, where the best performing models will be awarded.\nCindicator a System for Asset valuation, behind the now over 100,000 analysts.\nBittsAnalytics is an artificial intelligence-based platform for the analysis of crypto-currencies and ICOs. It offers Features such as Portfolio Tracking and provides trading signals.\nOverall, the insight into the world of Robo-Advisors, what is the Blocksize Capital is very interesting. Neither algo trading even automated Asset Management is new, however, the developments presented show currencies, the growing interest in the new Asset class is a Cryptographic. An event from the Blockchain Center that makes you want more\nThe following lecture was about the safekeeping of Bitcoin and other crypto-Assets. David Finkenstädt of Postera Fund presented the different Wallet options. Apart from the well-known different Hot and Cold Storages, he presented a Hardware security module. Hardware-security modules or short-HSM are not an invention of the crypto-Community, however these systems use to generate extremely secure Wallets.\nAlthough such approaches for the average private investor are exaggerated, but they could be for institutional investors is important. What struck me in the later discussion, was that you discussed a lot about how impossible the securing of a single Wallet. The Seed for a Private Key, you should roll the Paper Wallet with a PC that is offline, printing. And at the end of the Wallet is still not safe. Certainly, these safety thoughts are correct, however the easiest hedge has been ignored: Why, his Stake is not more Wallets distribute?\nIn the terminal there was yet another Talk on the legal aspects in the consideration of crypto-Assets. Unfortunately, a train had to be achieved back home, so we were not able to hear this lecture. What I saw up until that point was a very interesting event. They showed that in the Finance sector, not only the interest but also the Knowledge of crypto-currencies grows. It would be nice if there would be to this Seminar, a continuation!

Mertan tweeted that Bitcoin will go to $50000 in 2018.\nCrypto Influencer join Bitcoin Bulls Nicholas Merten, has tweeted his opinions and big prediction on bitcoin price to hit $50,000 by the end of year considering its drop downs in the market. However, whenever his shares his opinions or predicts, he can bring changes in trends over his 34,000 followers.\nOn May 27 th , 2018 he predicts on his tweet that Bitcoin is going to hit double of its 2017’s value by 2018. On the note, considering the recent drop downs, Merten has lists four aspects and believes that it will help Bitcoin price up to heights.\nFurther, one among his followers, Sammy Tommy have pointed out on his tweet and said, “interest rates have no correlation with cryptocurrency prices and that though Deutsche Bank is restructuring, there is no way a bank of that size is going under by the end of the year.”\nHowever, another follower asked Merten about the prediction by 2018 crypto market cap, he writes that,\n“in his model it should go to $1 trillion”.\nInitially, Merten seems to be seen somewhere between John McAfee an individualist in crypto space and others like Tom Lee and Brain Kelly who always brings traditional aspects on market predictions.\nOther Crypto Expert’s Predictions After concerning the dropping in Bitcoin price after the late last year impressive performance, the research head at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee has believed that Bitcoin will experience a major height owing to upcoming consensus conference.\nTom Lee has also undertaken the fact by combining bitcoin’s highs and lows situations. It has always given efficient gains during and after previous Consensus conferences. As a result, it is now all set to set for another Bitcoin Rally.\nHe said,\n“Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically. The coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years”.\nThe CEO and Founder of digital assets investment fund BKCM LLC, Brian Kelly predict that Bitcoin could attain $25000, a new high by this year. Kelly said in an interview with CNBC.\nIn an interview, Kelly has supported Tim Draper prediction. As he had said Bitcoin hits $250000 by 2022. Meanwhile responding to Draper’s prediction, Kelly said:\n“it sounds crazy,” when one considers that BTC already had a 4,000 percent return over two years, a 3,000 percent return over four years could be a “continuation of the trend we’ve seen”.\nRead Complete info on Coinpedia.org ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicholas merten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sammy tommy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mertan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "youtube celeb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin bulls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T10:31:22.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14604fac7a2bf5966313151aed6406e979311dae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4DKVhpdoMpIJJBzXRXfUA.V1vWYYN_LAo12tMJb_w0u0MiupuP7FfNpH8e7qQNA5b", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "\"Bitcoin isn't for people that live on less than $2 a day.

In May, the BTC/USD pair has lost almost 30% of its value and is currently trading at close to $7,000.\nThe decline had been attributed to the disappointing Consensus event in New York and an investigation launched by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) into bitcoin price manipulation.\nInvestigators will look at whether bitcoin holders or exchanges have been manipulating bitcoin prices to move higher or lower and will focus on practices such as spoofing (filling the market with fake orders in a bid to encourage others to buy and sell coins) and wash trading (trading with yourself to give the impression of a high market demand). The DOJ is reportedly working alongside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). - advertisement -\nOf course, manipulation within the crypto world is not new. It happens all the time. It has been reported that bitcoins are owned by very few people. This gives the holders an incentive to keep pushing the prices higher. This is in contrast to the stock markets where stock holders with a large stage are subjected to scrutiny particularly with regards to reporting. In the crypto space, there are no such rules giving holders a reason to push prices up.\nThe BTC/USD pair is currently trading at $7051. The pair is trading below the 25 and 50-day moving average. Its Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are all in the oversold territory on the four-hour chart as shown below. As such, after hitting the support of $7,000, the pair could start moving up. It could also continue the downward momentum to test the $6400 support.

The company will have rights over the Bitcoin name for an entire decade, until they have to renew in 2027.\nThis appears to be the most successful attempt at trademarking Bitcoin’s name in history. There have been attempts in the United States and Russia, but these have been denied.\nThe announcement which trademarks Bitcoin list hundreds of different products for which IP-Holdings has sole rights over the Bitcoin name. For example, a merchant selling Bitcoin t-shirts on the popular e-commerce website Etsy was sent a cease and desist letter because IP-Holding claims that anyone selling Bitcoin t-shirts must get permission first from them.\nIP-Holdings was aggressive towards the Etsy merchant , saying that his t-shirts amounted to an infringement of the UK Trade Marks Act and must be stopped immediately or there would be a lawsuit.\nOf course, permission from IP-Holdings to use the Bitcoin name comes at a price, which is the entire reason it trademarked Bitcoin in the first place. IP-Holdings does not produce any of the Bitcoin-branded products protected by its trademark, instead specializing in selling intellectual property rights.\nThe trademark has caused an uproar among netizens, particularly because many – including the Bitcoin Foundation – believe that Bitcoin should never be trademarked , a commercial pursuit at odds with the libertarian and open source ideals of the cryptocurrency.\nObservers also note that the company predates merchants who create Bitcoin themed products, yet threatens them with legal action if they don’t pay for the rights to use the Bitcoin name IP-Holdings money.\nBitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, last heard from in 2011.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram

Down Verge, Bitcoin Gold and MonaCoin\nPosted by | May 29, 2018 | Business |\nCALGARY, AB, May 29, 2018 /24-7PressRelease/ — While three major cryptocurrencies were losing millions of dollars to proof of work, or PoW, attacks, GoldCoin ($GLD) came out on top effortlessly. Thanks to its already-in-place 51-percent defense, the cryptocurrency neatly sidestepped a massive hash attack that targeted multiple exchanges.\nAccording to initial reports , the May 2018 incident was a classic example of 51-percent abuse. Hackers gained authority over significant amounts of hashing power so that they could override the consensus-based confirmations that power PoW cryptocurrencies. With the majority of the nodes on a network under their control, it was easy to fake consensus, spend coins twice and reverse transactions for their own gain.\nInterestingly, the coins targeted here didn’t seem to know how to respond even after exchanges lost millions. While the exchanges definitely took smart steps by halting deposits, it’s worth pointing out that many of the victimized protocols simply appeared to have been caught with their pants down. Verge, for instance, fell prey to a similar DDoS-based attack just a month earlier.\nWhere does GoldCoin ($GLD) stand amidst such turmoil? This wouldn’t be the first time that the cryptocurrency has faced such trials, but unsurprisingly, the bad actors seem to have passed it over in favor of easier pickings. Since Goldcoin has included a 51%-attack defense since 2013, attackers can’t spread their fraudulent blockchains around the network.\n“The GoldCoin Network has survived countless 51% attacks over its 5-year history and never flinched,” said community member Greg Matthews. “Because we’ve always focused on making Satoshi’s protocol more robust, GoldCoin users have never had to worry about these kinds of problems.”\nIs GoldCoin’s approach better than how other PoW protocols function? While it’s certainly superior to doing nothing, it also beats the standard solution where exchanges merely institute stricter confirmation requirements since it keeps transactions fast and consistent. To learn more about why GoldCoin is better-prepared, visit GoldCoinweb.com. You can also read a detailed whitepaper on how GoldCoin ($GLD) handles 51% attacks .\nGoldCoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that finally delivers on the promises of decentralization. It’s completely built and maintained by a team of dedicated volunteers who firmly believe in promoting economic freedom. Thanks to these principles and a focus on game-changing usability features, like two-minute confirmation speeds and instant 0-Conf transactions, GoldCoin is fundamentally changing how cryptocurrency and economies operate.\nUnlike the securities, stock options, profit sharing and other investment plans of centuries past, this is more than just a new way to invest: It’s a proven system where awards are based on math alone. Thanks to its SegWit-free design, the ledger is truly verifiable and safe.
