You can follow him on Twitter: @bitentrepreneur .\nIt was another hard fork day on May 15! Bitcoin Cash is creating a new blockchain with 32MB block size limits and added smart-contract functionality. This is the third hard fork that the Bitcoin Cash community has undergone in under a year, and declares their undeterred commitment to change whatever necessary to grow their blockchain’s transaction abilities. Bitcoin Cash strives to provide an inexpensive and fast medium of exchange for everyday payments. Sponsored Links\nA ‘hard’ fork refers to software changes that require the creation of a new blockchain from a previous one, whereas ‘soft’ forks can impute software updates without the creation of a new blockchain. A hard fork, therefore, is only implemented when there need to be changes made at the most fundamental level of the blockchain architecture; the consensus protocol layer. A Bit of Background on Bitcoin Cash\nBitcoin Cash was born out of a hard fork with Bitcoin’s blockchain last summer. After much debate amongst various parties of the Bitcoin ecosystem over how to scale the Bitcoin network, a group of developers organized under the name ABC Bitcoin, wrote the code for a hard fork to create a new blockchain with 8MB block limits. On August 1, this new code was implemented to copy the entire Bitcoin block history onto a new network to begin mining its own transactions separately, as a distinct currency and under different mining parameters. Bitcoin Cash promises to be a peer to peer cash system. This system should be popular in areas where the traditional financial system has been unable to reach the unbanked.\nIn the case of last summer’s hard fork, not only was a new blockchain created, but also a new coin was introduced to the market to represent value exchanged on this new transaction ledger. However, not all hard forks create new coins. For example, Bitcoin Cash hard forked again last November to fix their algorithm adjusting mining difficulty because the network was producing wildly fluctuating hash rates.\nTo patch the system, various developer teams running different clients on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain agreed to implement a hard fork where they all copied the old ledger onto a new chain, with the software updated, and abandoned the old chain. Although technically November was also a ‘hard’ fork, it was obviously very different than the previous split in community generating not only a new blockchain, but also a new network, and a new coin.\nHowever, it shouldn’t be understated that blockchain developers, including Bitcoin Cash, treat hard forking with caution, it’s a delicate process with potentially serious financial consequences. Though while many in the community treat hard forking with outright fear, this is a key part of how Bitcoin Cash operates, so the Bitcoin Cash community is not afraid of hard forks. What’s New with the Latest Hard Fork?\nThis time around is more similar to the November hard fork but slightly different. Today’s fork neither creates a new coin, nor does it correct an existing problem, but rather strictly innovates in two ways. The first major change is the tripling of the block size limit from 8MB to 32MB that is a forward-looking adjustment to accommodate greater transaction throughput per block. I feel better that this block size growth is occurring now, while the usage of Bitcoin Cash still has a way to grow, rather than later when the network is at full throttle.\nThis the larger block size gives Bitcoin Cash some room to scale, something that other blockchains have been looking to tackle in other ways, e.g., Lightning Network and Proof of Stake. This makes Bitcoin Cash somewhat unique because it attempts to solve the scaling problem at the consensus protocol layer while maintaining the Proof of Work model.\nHowever, larger blocks will not in effect grow the network regarding usage. It does, however, provide the ability for unprecedented growth. Growth in usage depends not on the block size but more on the community and businesses supporting Bitcoin Cash. Products, services and merchant adoption are key. After the block-size increase, the next advancement that Bitcoin Cash is putting forward is to add new and re-enable old, previously inactivated, machine-scripting operation codes, or more simply ‘op-codes,’ that give developers tools to create smart contracts.\nThese machine codes, called “Satoshi Op-codes” by the Bitcoin Cash community, allow developers to create different types of metadata implementations. By having the ability to call these functions, developers can create “colored coins” or representative tokens. These are tokens that can be tagged in a specific way to correspond to bonds, stocks, precious metals, commodities, and any physical or virtual object.\nIt is hard to say what might come out from this new functionality, but if we base our assumptions on what Ethereum has been able to accomplish from its second layer implementations, then I believe it will give Bitcoin Cash a lot of space for creative and productive ideas to blossom. To that end, we shall have to see what the developers of the Bitcoin Cash community do with these new functionalities and if the market decides to settle in this newfound block size that has yet be driven to scale.

He described it with the following words (free Translation):\nI think we are in an important Phase, which approaches could be good or bad for the crypto market.\nHe continued that the government was the highest-laundering concern because of the potential crime with a focus on money and the illegal Stealing of assets from exchanges and Wallets.

During the decline, BTC\\/USD broke this week\\u2019s ascending channel with support at $8,500 on the hourly chart. The pair traded close to the $8,000 support level and a low was formed at $8,080. At the moment, the price is consolidating above $8,000s, with an initial resistance around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low. However, the most important hurdle on the upside is at $8,400 and $8,500, which were supports earlier. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price action suggests a lot of bearish signs below $8,500. It may correct a few points in the short term, but it is likely to face sellers on the upside near $8,500. On the downside, a break below the $8,000 support may perhaps push the price further into a bearish zone. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is placed nicely in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is currently moving higher from the oversold levels. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $8,000 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,500 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Made Sharp U-Turn appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:34:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af8fbcc6ffbafe97b39a0bf711a5071f168ea09a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMpvRjwlln6fpS3LUJTGCidsvVeF7NV1tW3HGjBMCPB38Wt9TN6kFoEUtCooXsOXR6jr_F6yEWt5Q8rBHqnZ3Ge88Pe_lJzIXSIfihd05TbsFLDp1zflojd4BgIZKXQdJ7Q-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6837", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "CNBC.com News", "title": "The internet 'needs a native currency' and Jack Dorsey wants to help it be bitcoin", "title_full": "The internet 'needs a native currency' and Jack Dorsey wants to help it be bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T20:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af8fbcc6ffbafe97b39a0bf711a5071f168ea09a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMpvRjwlln6fpS3LUJTGCidsvVeF7NV1tW3HGjBMCPB38Wt9TN6kFoEUtCooXsOXR6jr_F6yEWt5Q8rBHqnZ3Ge88Pe_lJzIXSIfihd05TbsFLDp1zflojd4BgIZKXQdJ7Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T20:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "The internet 'needs a native currency' and Jack Dorsey wants to help it be bitcoin", "text": "May 16, 2018 at 13:32 PM EDT The internet 'needs a native currency' and Jack Dorsey wants to help it be bitcoin Dorsey spoke at the Consensus blockchain conference in New York Wednesday Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

BTC\\/USD is now trading well below $8,500 with a few bearish signs. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nThe past two days were mostly positive for bitcoin price above the $8,600 support against the US Dollar. However, the price failed to move above the $8,800 resistance area. Buyers struggled to place the price above $8,800, which resulted in a downside move. The price declined sharply and broke a couple of support levels such as $8,700, $8,600 and $8,400. \\n\nThe decline was substantial as the price settled below a key support at $8,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average . During the decline, BTC\\/USD broke this week\\u2019s ascending channel with support at $8,500 on the hourly chart. The pair traded close to the $8,000 support level and a low was formed at $8,080. At the moment, the price is consolidating above $8,000s, with an initial resistance around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low. However, the most important hurdle on the upside is at $8,400 and $8,500, which were supports earlier. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price action suggests a lot of bearish signs below $8,500. It may correct a few points in the short term, but it is likely to face sellers on the upside near $8,500. On the downside, a break below the $8,000 support may perhaps push the price further into a bearish zone. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is placed nicely in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is currently moving higher from the oversold levels. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $8,000 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,500 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Made Sharp U-Turn ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:20:09.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bf83430cc87870d3e798a9670d5053cd40e7205", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9yhN4zV_Q7X5aukF8hkv_t8", "site_full": "xn4.org", "site": "xn4.org", "site_section": "http://xn4.org/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "xn4.org", "title": "Nobody Knows How Much Energy Bitcoin Is Using", "title_full": "Nobody Knows How Much Energy Bitcoin Is Using", "published": "2018-05-16T20:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bf83430cc87870d3e798a9670d5053cd40e7205", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9yhN4zV_Q7X5aukF8hkv_t8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dodwmd", "published": "2018-05-16T20:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobody Knows How Much Energy Bitcoin Is Using", "text": " Nobody Knows How Much Energy Bitcoin Is Using Nobody Knows How Much Energy Bitcoin Is Using Posted on by dodwmd\ndmoberhaus writes: A new report published in ‘Joule’ today claims Bitcoin may use up to 0.5% of the world’s energy by the end of this year.

It seems only fitting to have the 2018 National Settlement Services Summit (NS3) close with a lively discussion of this topic. During the session titled “Blockchain, Bitcoin and You,” three industry insiders will discuss how the growth of Blockchain and cryptocurrency stands to benefit title agents, lenders, Realtors and borrowers. “I don’t want to sound too simplistic but it’s just going to change the way we do everything,” Crypto Realty Group CEO Piper Moretti said. “Rather than going to several different sources for all the information that we need as Realtors, we’ll be able to close on a house in a matter of a few days rather than a month to 45 or 60 days. Transactions will be infinitely faster. That’s the end goal, I believe.” Moretti will be joined by John Heck, director industry general manager at DXC Technology Co. and former of IBM, and Matt Einheber, principal at Transfer: Real Estate Intelligence. In addition to speed, the speakers will detail how Blockchain could improve fraud mitigation, reduce errors, cut down on paperwork and much more. Moretti said she is working with some startups in the process of developing essentially a one-stop shop for all parts of the real estate transaction, from beginning to end. The efficiency of Blockchain enables them to dream big in terms of ushering in a new modern era of real estate transactions. “We’ll look at traditional recordkeeping, which is completely archaic, and what is hopefully coming down the pike,” she said. “It really just comes down to adoption. How fast can we do it and how fast can we learn it.” Some states already are taking steps to better accommodate Blockchain, she noted, such as Arizona and California. Both states have introduced legislation to make Blockchain a legal form of recordkeeping, which could alleviate issues with the use of cryptocurrency that continue to crop up. The speakers also will touch on how companies can effectively protect borrowers’ sensitive information and keep them abreast of information that is pivotal to a smooth home-buying process.

Share: Credit: © beeboys / Fotolia Close Bitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value. But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there. advertisement\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts -- as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins -- a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power. \"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries says.\nIt's figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner's costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive. \"Sometimes the best information we've got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That's the stuff we have to work with,\" he says.\nStill, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the U.S. have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining. \"But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it's very forward-looking. It's focused not on the now, but on where we're headed. And I think that's something you really need to know if you're going to draft policy about it,\" he says.\nHe also points out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable. We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I'm doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.\" advertisement\nMaterials provided by Cell Press . Note:\nJournal Reference : Alex de Vries. Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem .

The Bitcoin asset management platform has designed this new product to cater to long-term hodlers. The LedgerX Bitcoin ‘Call Overwrite’\nLaunched on May 15th, the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account enables investors to earn a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. Instead of hodling in the hope of a significant price increase, savers can now earn revenue from a call overwrite. Usually, overwrite contracts are for assets that are deemed to be undervalued or overvalued. The trader overwrites calls if the latter is the case and overwrites puts if the former is the case.\nWith this investment technique, traders deposit Bitcoin in their LedgerX accounts. The trader then sets a call option sold at a longer date with an accompanying slightly higher strike call option. LedgerX already offers similar trading techniques, but this new product makes the process a lot less complicated.\nThe new Bitcoin savings account will enable less finance-savvy investors to earn USD premiums on their Bitcoin holdings. Traders have the freedom to select both the number of bitcoins and the premium rate. Options contracts on the new account will be offered in both three months and six months duration. LedgerX will also charge a transaction fee for the product. CFTC Regulations\nLedgerX’s new Bitcoin savings account is provided under license from the CFTC. The company has both the CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) and the swap execution facility (SEF) licenses . In an interview with Forbes , Juthica Chou spoke about the importance of being a licensed Bitcoin company. The LedgerX co-founder and CTO said that the company’s products are all in compliance with statutory regulations. She also said LedgerX takes a deliberate approach to ensuring that it stays within the confines of the law.\nCommenting on the new product, Chou expressed optimism that it would become a favorite of the company’s customers. The LedgerX CTO based her confidence on the current trading pattern already established in the company. According to Chou, more than 70 percent of LedgerX’s trading volume comes from similar Bitcoin options contracts.\nLast quarter, the company also recorded a notional transaction average of $30 million per month. Another reason for Chou’s optimism is the Bitcoin volatility which makes call overwrites an attractive investment strategy.\nWill the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account encourage more long-term holding of the cryptocurrency?

When asked if there's a chance that the worth of the cryptocurrency rises three fold to five fold, he responded that there's a \"very high probability.\"\nRelated Links:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://benzingafintechawards.com/", "https://www.etoro.com/en-us/", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4174301-bitcoin-cash-digital-fools-gold?source=partner_benzinga"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason raznick", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "assia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yori assia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital fool", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:26:21.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61b26a995219892ee58cd0b948f9276b3e8837f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRtHcwbqWXBpQZClHr0trw8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Bitcoin is Different From Other Currencies?", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin is Different From Other Currencies?", "published": "2018-05-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61b26a995219892ee58cd0b948f9276b3e8837f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRtHcwbqWXBpQZClHr0trw8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DPrillio", "published": "2018-05-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin is Different From Other Currencies?", "text": "Quote: from: AjithBtc on Today at 10:45:11 AM Bitcoin is different from other currencies in terms of its availability. People were not much aware about the active use of bitcoin and the advantage of having digital availability. When years pass people will get adopted to the advancement. Major difference is the growth which is high compared to that of physical currency.\nFor me, the obvious difference of bitcoin compared to other fiat currency is that bitcoin is a decentralized form of virtual currency, no other party can interfere or control for it and it was called a virtual currency because its not a true currency its only an electronics form of monetary system that has a digital value that almost convertible to any true currency.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:29:18.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5ec1173fd4dfbf1afbf44f3a1462fcaae1ff597", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jHzspLyBpbR3_rWGrkkoboBfMWanfr4gm4Pg0vbYgw0ceNPQx3_2oBa.e4T.NtWwWTJMb0WSLN71aR2bctp9N7A--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts", "title_full": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts", "published": "2018-05-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ledgerx-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5ec1173fd4dfbf1afbf44f3a1462fcaae1ff597", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jHzspLyBpbR3_rWGrkkoboBfMWanfr4gm4Pg0vbYgw0ceNPQx3_2oBa.e4T.NtWwWTJMb0WSLN71aR2bctp9N7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoinist", "published": "2018-05-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts", "text": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts May 16, 2018 271\nLedgerX has introduced a Bitcoin savings product licensed by the CFTC. The Bitcoin asset management platform has designed this new product to cater to long-term hodlers. The LedgerX Bitcoin ‘Call Overwrite’\nLaunched on May 15th, the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account enables investors to earn a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. Instead of hodling in the hope of a significant price increase, savers can now earn revenue from a call overwrite. Usually, overwrite contracts are for assets that are deemed to be undervalued or overvalued. The trader overwrites calls if the latter is the case and overwrites puts if the former is the case.\nWith this investment technique, traders deposit Bitcoin in their LedgerX accounts. The trader then sets a call option sold at a longer date with an accompanying slightly higher strike call option. LedgerX already offers similar trading techniques, but this new product makes the process a lot less complicated.\nThe new Bitcoin savings account will enable less finance-savvy investors to earn USD premiums on their Bitcoin holdings. Traders have the freedom to select both the number of bitcoins and the premium rate. Options contracts on the new account will be offered in both three months and six months duration. LedgerX will also charge a transaction fee for the product. CFTC Regulations\nLedgerX’s new Bitcoin savings account is provided under license from the CFTC. The company has both the CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) and the swap execution facility (SEF) licenses . In an interview with Forbes , Juthica Chou spoke about the importance of being a licensed Bitcoin company. The LedgerX co-founder and CTO said that the company’s products are all in compliance with statutory regulations. She also said LedgerX takes a deliberate approach to ensuring that it stays within the confines of the law.\nCommenting on the new product, Chou expressed optimism that it would become a favorite of the company’s customers. The LedgerX CTO based her confidence on the current trading pattern already established in the company. According to Chou, more than 70 percent of LedgerX’s trading volume comes from similar Bitcoin options contracts.\nLast quarter, the company also recorded a notional transaction average of $30 million per month. Another reason for Chou’s optimism is the Bitcoin volatility which makes call overwrites an attractive investment strategy.\nWill the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account encourage more long-term holding of the cryptocurrency?

Juthica Chou, Chief Operating Officer at LedgerX said:\n“Everything we do requires both the licenses. And a lot of that is intentional, because by making it a package deal we can offer a number of services to our customers in a really clear, vertically integrated way.”\nThe licenses permit users to earn a yield on their Bitcoin assets. Rather than just “hodling” and hoping that Bitcoin appreciates, investors can earn a fiat-based yield on their BTC by employing what is referred to as a call overwrite technique, wherein an investor deposits BTC into LedgerX, then sells a call option at a slightly longer date, with a higher strike call option.\nThe project is designed to simplify BTC option trading to a basic point-and-click format, so “less sophisticated” bull traders can potentially get a premium price on their holdings. The product’s interface allows users to choose the implied rate they’re anticipating to earn and the number of BTC they wish to earn the yield on.

The animated video about Blockchain and Bitcoin that was released today on http://bitcoinproperly.org is the first to specifically address the technology behind Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Within five minutes, it is explained how the essential functions of the “trusted third party” can be automatized through the Blockchain as well as what the implications of this are.\nFrom Bitcoin hype to Blockchain revolution: an internet of trust. With the arrival of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, everyone around the world can trade with each other without any involvement from traditional third parties such as banks, notaries, accountants, and governments. Trade is a fundamental pillar of our economy and society, and traditional trusted parties play a crucial role in this.\nThe technology behind Bitcoin making all this possible – the Blockchain – ensures that the essential functions of the “trusted third party’, are fully automatized through the internet. This way, these functions are as freely available, accessible, and programmable as the internet itself.\nThe animated video, available in both Dutch and English, explains how this works, also mentioning practical applications. The implications are clear: in the coming years, the role of the traditional trusted parties will inevitably and drastically change, strongly impacting our daily lives.\nThe creators of this animated video invite its viewers to think about and discuss the fundamental and radical innovations made possible by crypto currencies.\nRutger van Zuidam founder of Dutchchain, organizer of the Dutch Blockchain Hackathon: “The Netherlands have all the assets to become Europe’s Silicon Valley of financial technology. It is possible for the Netherlands to position itself favourably in comparison to the US and UK, who are currently still ahead. The technology behind crypto currencies like Bitcoin plays an essential role in leveraging these opportunities. We hope that the animated video about the technology behind crypto currencies will positively affect this development.”\nLykle de Vries: ”Bitcoin is not the new money for internet,but it is the new internet for money, value and ownership in all forms. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are the next step in the emancipation of all world citizens, and can help create a new dynamic for democracy, society and economy.”\nAbout the creators The animated video is a non-profit initiative by designers Patrick Loonstra (www.patrickloonstra.nl) and Sebas van den Brink (sebasvandenbrink.nl) and entrepreneurs Lykle de Vries (ThesisOne.com) and Rutger van Zuidam (DutchChain.com).

Liquidity issues have seen the cryptocurrency, delisted from two crypto exchanges in recent months. Does BCH Really Need 32MB Blocks?\nOne of the most significant challenges that Bitcoin Cash faces have to do with the fact that it is not being used as much as its backers claim. BCH’s cash block, which is a measure of the bundles of transactions processed isn’t as big, as many would have expected. Sponsored Links\nBCH is utilizing on average about 1/160th of its 8MB block size. What this means is that only 50kb of the block size is currently being used, underscoring the reduced number of transactions being carried using the coin. BCH block size. Source: BitInfoCharts Block Size Increase Deficiency\nDespite the low transaction volumes, Bitcoin Cash developer team implemented a fourfold increase in the altcoin’s block size. The block size is being increased to 32MB even though the current 8MB is not being used to capacity. In contrast, bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency, has a maximum block size of 1MB.\nBitcoin Cash is essentially providing a solution to a problem it does not have as it moves to increase the block size. Such a move would only have made sense if the cryptocurrency was eliciting strong demand in terms of transactions.\nThe insistence of block size increase, despite a lack of demand, underscores how the developer’s team is out of touch with sentiments on the ground. The proposed expansion has already elicited backlash with Chief Strategy officer at Blockstream Samson Mow summing up what the increase amounts to in a tweet. Source: Twitter Low Transactions, Low Liquidity, and Delistings\nBitcoin cash transactions are a shadow of daily transactions carried on Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that came into being as a joke. Reduced number of transactions carried on the token has essentially led to liquidity problems for some cryptocurrency exchanges. DOGE > BCH? Source: BitInfoCharts\nIn March 2018, OKEx, one of the largest cryptocurrencies exchanges, ended support for Bitcoin Cash citing inadequate liquidity.\nBCH sentiments have yet again suffered another blow after the Netherlands’ largest cryptocurrency exchange, BL3P, ended support for the altcoin.

Liquidity issues have seen the cryptocurrency, delisted from two crypto exchanges in recent months.\nDoes BCH Really Need 32MB Blocks? One of the most significant challenges that Bitcoin Cash faces have to do with the fact that it is not being used as much as its backers claim. BCH's cash block, which is a measure of the bundles of transactions processed isn't as big, as many would have expected.\nBCH is utilizing on average about 1/160th of its 8MB block size. What this means is that only 50kb of the block size is currently being used, underscoring the reduced number of transactions being carried using the coin.\nBCH block size. Source: BitInfoCharts\nBlock Size Increase Deficiency Despite the low transaction volumes, Bitcoin Cash developer team implemented a fourfold increase in the altcoin 's block size. The block size is being increased to 32MB even though the current 8MB is not being used to capacity. In contrast, bitcoin , which is the most popular cryptocurrency, has a maximum block size of 1MB.\nBitcoin Cash is essentially providing a solution to a problem it does not have as it moves to increase the block size. Such a move would only have made sense if the cryptocurrency was eliciting strong demand in terms of transactions.\nThe insistence of block size increase, despite a lack of demand, underscores how the developer's team is out of touch with sentiments on the ground. The proposed expansion has already elicited backlash with Chief Strategy officer at Blockstream Samson Mow summing up what the increase amounts to in a tweet.\nSource: Twitter\nLow Transactions, Low Liquidity, and Delistings Bitcoin cash transactions are a shadow of daily transactions carried on Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that came into being as a joke.

Source: BitInfoCharts\nIn March 2018, OKEx, one of the largest cryptocurrencies exchanges, ended support for Bitcoin Cash citing inadequate liquidity.\nBCH sentiments have yet again suffered another blow after the Netherlands' largest cryptocurrency exchange, BL3P, ended support for the altcoin.

May 17, 2018\nCryptocurrencies may soon be used for daily transactions as many people across governments and private entities start adapting to the revolutionary new technology. BitPay announced a formal agreement with Florida’s Seminole County Tax Collector, Joel M. Greenberg.\nAs a progressive move, Bitcoin [BTC] and Bitcoin cash [BCH] can now both be used for tax payments, beginning this summer. County residents can use cryptocurrency to pay for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\nJoel M. Greenberg, Seminole County Tax Collector, explained:\n“We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.”\nCryptocurrency isn’t necessarily moral or immoral. It is an amoral technology, a tool. It can be used for terrorism, vacation getaways, housing, and, now, taxes. As governments are wont, they’re usually immune from innovation. But when it comes to revenue collection they’re surprisingly spry, alert, on it.\nThe processors take a heavy cut in paying taxes by credit or debit. The advent of cryptocurrency and the BitPay Visa does away with a great many previous frictions, making the expropriation experience win-win; enthusiasts don’t have to do yet another conversion, and governments save in fees.\nHead of Compliance at BitPay, Jeremie Beaudry, detailed:\n“Bitpay was born out of the potential of the blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale. With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.”\nBitPay and Seminole County teamed to allow Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin for pretty much everything; car tags and titles, licenses, and property tax.\nThe money is directly paid in fiat to the account of the county tax collector by the following business day. The local government is spared notorious price volatility and the usual risk associated with cryptocurrency. BitPay in their press release insists that through a push transaction, the user sends the exact amount of bitcoin or bitcoin cash needed to pay the bill. This eliminates traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards.\nThe company’s fees are also better than merely competitive, as 1% per approval is way below market rate. And for those wishing to pay their taxes, the processor can be accessed through traditional computers or smartphones.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cryptocurren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel m. greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seminole county tax collector", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:28:57.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb2075311a51c4c237a595bc12d1fa03b237ce3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQekndoh9Utx0KGsAG9R0F_RpvR39LebffAwaw5OKKQkXWeEoLsNabzUHFt2HAsqSw-", "site_full": "bitzuma.com", "site": "bitzuma.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Learn Bitcoin with this Free Sixty-Video Course [Annotated Playlist]", "title_full": "Learn Bitcoin with this Free Sixty-Video Course [Annotated Playlist]", "published": "2018-05-16T19:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitzuma.com/images/courses/princeton/index.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb2075311a51c4c237a595bc12d1fa03b237ce3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQekndoh9Utx0KGsAG9R0F_RpvR39LebffAwaw5OKKQkXWeEoLsNabzUHFt2HAsqSw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T19:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Learn Bitcoin with this Free Sixty-Video Course [Annotated Playlist]", "text": "Learn Bitcoin with this Free Sixty-Video Course [Annotated Playlist] By Rich Apodaca | Updated May 12th, 2018\nThe videos in this course were developed at Princeton University.

Now, part of this would have been the huge move in the US dollar, at one point during early US trading, showed a lot of strength. That of course being half of the equation, it makes sense that we would drop. The 9,000 has offered too much resistance to break above, which is not a good sign considering the 10,000 being even more resistance. I think we are probably going to test 8,000. We could drift a bit lower from here. Pay attention to the US dollar index. It will have a significant index.\nBitcoin/JPY — We have struggled at 1 million yen and I find that interesting concern that the yen got pummeled against the US dollar which is the benchmark for the strength of the yen. So, I think that even with the weaker yen, we are probably showing signs of extreme weakness. If we do break above 1.1, then we could go to 1.2 But I think we are more likley to test 900,000, and then 800,000 yen.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , technical analysis\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:16:48.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1be08d355ea6ce6549d8d64c884fc37f3815ce46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9zMuu7yP7.9mHRXBv3_O3PWHLMJYZFz5WoVvSOQPRpuR3PGy8i.uU406qfTJGK0Sq7God5jmZSzA--", "site_full": "www.nigerianbestforum.com", "site": "nigerianbestforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=a08a891f8839ff95bd1bce080010e339&action=.xml;type=rss", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Nigerian Best Forum .

Secondly, the candlestick also closed on the opposite of the trend line. The price action also showed that the price retouched the trend line and began a ranged bound movement. Based of that, it was assumed that the downtrend was over. It was previously stated that Bitcoin price is unlikely to continue its downtrend. Today, the price was trading at $8,341. 68 at the time of writing. However, the weekly chart shows that it fell again to the previous day's low of $8,341. 68. Nevertheless, if the asset continues its fall, it will certainly retest the previous low of $8,000. The relative strength index period 14 is level 27 indicating that the market is oversold.

Released by Cell Press\nBitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value. But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts--as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins--a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power. \"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries says.\nIt's figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner's costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive. \"Sometimes the best information we've got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That's the stuff we have to work with,\" he says.\nStill, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the U.S. have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining. \"But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it's very forward-looking. It's focused not on the now, but on where we're headed. And I think that's something you really need to know if you're going to draft policy about it,\" he says.\nHe also points out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable. We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started.

Truly, I used to play games to get bitcoin from Android apps, I really dont remember what name of the game is, but I quitted it a long time ago. To speak frankly, its easy to play that game, but too hard to get bitcoin. We dont have to think difficultly or make your mind closely in that game. But actually, to collect bitcoin from that game, you actually waste a big amount of times. What more, the rewards that you get from game is not significant for your benefit. I think its not worth spending time such a game like that.\nYeah. Playing Bitcoin games in order to gain a decent reward is not really worth your time. You would be spending hours just to earn a few pennies within a day. I used to think that I was going to earn a lot of Bitcoin playing such games within my early days, but then I've realized that there were better options out there to make some decent income with Bitcoin.\nDon't take me wrong, but even if Bitcoin games don't offer attractive pay rates, they're somewhat fun to play and great for starting into cryptocurrencies. Faucets are also good for newcomers into Bitcoin, but their rewards are small just like the Bitcoin games. What's more is that Bitcoin's fees have increased lately (although they have been decreasing throughout the year) making micropayments impractical in these games. Therefore, I think that while Bitcoin's fees are high, other games would need to use other cryptocurrencies that would allow them to pay the rewards without sacrificing fee costs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T11:57:20.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "455db7c141393ed99ba01342b32cd8bc43da8d6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFmJJAAwQRsRP2F0bzHXtDVL0QQArzWJiGFv1m1C4WxBAIpB4b5QNVoZSGrwcSpA91RLq9HKhUdiXr6GTx2wbVSHYaPvardyHYlmeTg18maUBPjMjxvD0uKz0Frx66HFfxE.9DLAMcRPjmnAr15j2NV1GhhDs8pSd.w--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Financial specialists are aiming to purchase bitcoin whether advisors like it or not, says monetary pundit", "title_full": "Financial specialists are aiming to purchase bitcoin whether advisors like it or not, says monetary pundit", "published": "2018-05-16T19:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Financial-specialists-are-aiming-to-purchase-bitcoin-whether-advisors-like-it-or-not-says-monetary-pundit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "455db7c141393ed99ba01342b32cd8bc43da8d6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFmJJAAwQRsRP2F0bzHXtDVL0QQArzWJiGFv1m1C4WxBAIpB4b5QNVoZSGrwcSpA91RLq9HKhUdiXr6GTx2wbVSHYaPvardyHYlmeTg18maUBPjMjxvD0uKz0Frx66HFfxE.9DLAMcRPjmnAr15j2NV1GhhDs8pSd.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T19:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Financial specialists are aiming to purchase bitcoin whether advisors like it or not, says monetary pundit", "text": " Financial specialists are aiming to purchase bitcoin whether advisors like it or not, says monetary pundit\nIt’s a question that financial advisors increasingly hear these days.

The expert called the cryptocurrency “dollar 2.0.”\nThe Bitcoin cryptocurrency was developed by “American intelligence agencies,” Natalya Kaspersky, CEO of the InfoWatch group of companies and specialist in cyber security systems, said during her presentation at ITMO University in St. Petersburg.\nKaspersky was giving a speech on information wars and digital sovereignty. Photos of her presentation entitled “Modern technologies – the basis for information and cyber-wars,” have been published on social media.\n“Bitcoin is a project of American intelligence agencies, which was designed to provide quick funding for US, British and Canadian intelligence activities in different countries. [The technology] is ‘privatized,’ just like the Internet, GPS and TOR. In fact, it is dollar 2.0. Its rate is controlled by the owners of exchanges,” one of the slides read.\nShe also claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonym used by its founder or founders) is the name for a group of American cryptographers.\nThe presentation also claimed that a smartphone cannot be considered as a personal gadget.\nA smartphone “is a remotely controlled device designed for entertainment, work and at the same time for spying on its owner,” according to Kaspersky, who is also the co-founder of Kaspersky Lab. https://sputniknews.com/business/201801191060881605-kasperskaya-bitcoin-us-intelligence/\nThis revelation is part of the ongoing crackdown on the Deep State worldwide.

Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" says financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries.\nBitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value. But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule, de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts—as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking.\nIt's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\nIt's figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner's costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive. \"Sometimes the best information we've got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That's the stuff we have to work with,\" he says.\nStill, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the U.S. have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining. \"But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it's very forward-looking. It's focused not on the now, but on where we're headed. And I think that's something you really need to know if you're going to draft policy about it,\" he says.\nHe also points out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable. We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I'm doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.\"\nThe Daily Galaxy via Cell Press\nMay 16, 2018 Most Popular Space & Science Headlines\nStephen Hawking's Great Question --\"Why Isn't the Milky Way Crawling With Mechanical or Biological Life?\"\n\"Alien Minds\" --'Artificial Intelligence Is Already Out There, and It's Billions of Years Old' (VIDEO)\n\"Point of No Return\" --MIT Scientist Predicts the Event Horizon for Earth's 6th Mass Extinction\nA Neutron Star Collision in Our Milky Way Neighborhood Could Destroy Earth\n \"300-Million Nuclear Bombs\" --New Insights Into Global Impact of Titanic Chicxulub Mass-Extinction Event\nStephen Hawking: Wake Up, Science Deniers! --\"Earth is Morphing into Venus\" (WATCH Today's 'Galaxy' Stream)\n\"Evolutionary Leap?\" AI is Mimicing the Human Brain --\"But Several Orders of Magnitude Faster and More Efficiently\nChina Creates a Laser of Mind-Boggling Power --\"Could Rip Space Asunder, Breaking the Vacuum\"\n\"Stop Saying That Dinosaurs Went Extinct.

This attack is sort of a feat in the cryptocurrency space. What is Verge cryptocurrency? Verge (XVG) is a privacy coin which claims to be an improvement on the existing Bitcoin blockchain with an aim to provide individuals and businesses with a fast, efficient and decentralized way of making payments with anonymity. What is a 51% percent attack? It is an attack when a miner or group of miners are able to manipulate/modify the blockchain of a cryptocurrency by controlling more than 50% of the mining hash rate. This type of an attack is very unusual due to the extreme difficulty involved in acquiring the dominant mining hash rate. Public blockchains are fully decentralized and hence the only way of approving transactions is the consensus. When a miner is able to achieve 51% mining hash rate then the particular miner can mine all the blocks and gain access to the coins and create fraudulent transactions. Attackers can also reverse transactions that were in the confirmation process when they gained control of the network, allowing them to fraudulently spend the same coins several times, a practice known as- double spending. What has exactly happened? According to various press and social media sources, a miner(s) was able to achieve majority control of the mining hash rate. The miner exploited a bug in the code to duplicate timestamps and created each new block using the same algorithm. The integrity of a blockchain relies on the fact that different algorithms are required to create new blocks. The attackers taunted the Verge Project Team by writing on a Bitcointalk forum post, which read: “Hey Verge Team, get some real developers and fix your code. We have found another 2 exploits which can make quick hashes as well.” How much damage has been done? It is said that the miner was able to steal 2,50,000 verge coins. Some even claim the stolen amount to be 3.9 million coins. The “Send Us ETH” army wasn’t far behind from exploiting the situation. They started posting on the official forums about a fraud compensation plan for the victims, which involved their usual modus operand of “send us some ETH and get bonuses”. How did the Verge Project Team respond to this situation? The response came from Verge team was as: “We pushed a quick fix and most pools have already updated.. we’re already working on a whole new block verification process. We’re kinda glad this happened and that it wasn’t as bad as it could have been.” Actually, they accidentally initiated a hard fork to ‘resolve’ this issue! How did the Verge prices get affected? At the time of writing, the prices of Verge are down by 23.5%. The prices had doubled earlier this week due to the anticipation of a big announcement on April 16.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Person"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:41:35.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b9a26e16c1db6733d20655043bfe31eca0f3675", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1cOWFdjlKsN61IiUYVIFtpCQcsXB8wLMNRzF_su9Q_IUxzaIFIDvIXsWeneQIDJ4LhXlhgCnEkcIObOumwXhM8zP6S8FC3sQ-", "site_full": "pcproactive.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://pcproactive.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Proactive Computing", "title": "Bitcoin will use 0.5% of the world’s electricity by end of 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin will use 0.5% of the world’s electricity by end of 2018", "published": "2018-05-16T18:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b9a26e16c1db6733d20655043bfe31eca0f3675", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1cOWFdjlKsN61IiUYVIFtpCQcsXB8wLMNRzF_su9Q_IUxzaIFIDvIXsWeneQIDJ4LhXlhgCnEkcIObOumwXhM8zP6S8FC3sQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Gray (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T18:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will use 0.5% of the world’s electricity by end of 2018", "text": "\nA single bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity as the average Dutch household uses in a month Author:Anthony Cuthbertson #pch3lp #tech #TheNewz #TechNews source: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-mining-energy-use-electricity-cryptocurrency-a8353981.html Please visit our website: http://pcproactive.com\nvia http://pcproactive.com\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-mining-energy-use-electricity-cryptocurrency-a8353981.html ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony cuthbertson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:01:01.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "00f0e4e061d148ed16d47f8d3920dea519afcb80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQrYmdyGeZMGjtJmKH0mdXM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin a Bubble?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin a Bubble?", "published": "2018-05-16T18:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00f0e4e061d148ed16d47f8d3920dea519afcb80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQrYmdyGeZMGjtJmKH0mdXM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BitcoinLoan", "published": "2018-05-16T18:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin a Bubble?", "text": "Quote: from: jonas5222000 on May 16, 2018, 10:31:20 AM Some poeple hoping for the bursting price of the bitcoin,because of wanting to earn more, but im sure after this year will end bitcoin has suprise for us and this is the highed and pumped price.\nIn most bubbles, many people, usually those who are long the bubbling asset, come up with all kinds of reasons why this time its different and this is NOT a bubble, but rather a movement Bitcoin to a new norm.

Genesis Mining, a partial owner of HIVE Blockchain Technologies, is one of the largest cryptocurrency miners in the world.\nDaniela starts by gauging Marco’s reaction to famed investor Warren Buffett’s recent negative comments on the digital currency space. Marco explains that there have always been strong critics toward this emerging industry, and that’s normal. “If something is new and has never been there before, then yeah, people have their opinions,” he says. Daniela also dives into whether or not the mining of digital currencies is becoming too crowded a space, or if there is still room for new participants. See how Marco answers this question by comparing bitcoin mining to the California Gold Rush in the full replay below! Want to learn more about Marco Streng and crypto-mining?

Economist Alex de Vries, whose Digiconomist blog hosts the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index , quantified bitcoin’s energy requirements in a paper published in the scientific journal Joule on 16 May. The electricity demands comes from the computing power required to mine bitcoin – the process of generating new units of the cryptocurrency by solving complex mathematical puzzles. These puzzles are designed to get more complicated as bitcoin’s network grows , thus requiring even greater computing power. It is the first time estimates of bitcoin’s energy demands have been peer-reviewed and adds considerable weight to the debate of how to address the environmental impact of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. “We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed,” Mr de Vries said. “Half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.” The amount of energy required to support the bitcoin network has grown to 'epic proportions', according to Digiconomist founder Alex de Vries (Digiconomist) More Previous calculations by Mr de Vries have been used to predict how long it would take for bitcoin’s energy consumption to be unsustainable. At one point during bitcoin’s rapid rise in late 2017, if the network’s growth had continued it would have required all of the world’s current energy production in order to support itself by 2020. Various factors mean that this would never actually occur, however Mr de Vries warns that the network could someday consume 5 per cent of the world’s electricity. To limit the impact of such energy consumption, some states in the US have put restrictions in place around bitcoin mining.

Do not be mistaken in thinking there will be any major upward momentum for all of these coins in the coming hours, though. Right now, the Bitcoin price is starting to recover a bit, as reaching $8,500 again is the first order of business right now. Bitcoin Price Recovery has to Start Somewhere This past week has not been all too great for most cryptocurrencies. Especially the Bitcoin price has gone through another rough patch. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price dropped from $8,750 all the way to $8,179. It is a pretty big drop, considering how things could have easily gone the other way as well. Unfortunately, it seems manipulators and market makers do not want any positive cryptocurrency momentum to materialize at this time. With this week’s dip in the books, it now seems the Bitcoin price is clawing its way out of this hole again. Over the past few hours, the value has risen to $8,435 again, which is a positive start. While it is only a drop in the proverbial bucket, positive momentum has to start somewhere. In the case of the Bitcoin price, a $300 increase in mere hours is a pretty solid trend overall. This doesn’t automatically mean we will see this trend continue all that long, though. The net result over the past 24 hours is a decline in Bitcoin price by 3.98%. It is better than a 7% decline, but it still shows how brittle this cryptocurrency really is in 2018. Any sort of negative momentum will immediately send the value crashing, even though there is no news that should affect the markets in such a way. Investors are spooked very easily, which only highlights the need for decentralized solutions rather than centralized exchanges. With $7.26bn in 24-hour trading volume , the demand to buy and sell Bitcoin has not diminished in the slightest. Granted, there is a slight dip in volume compared to last week, but it represents less than 10%. How this will play out in the coming hours and days, remains to be seen. If the volume remains at this level, it seems evident the Bitcoin price will continue to rise later today. Reaching $8,500 will still be an uphill battle, though. Judging by the exchanges ranked by trading volume, it seems USDT trading still remains very popular. OKEx, Binance, and Huobi are all in the top four with their USDT trading pairs. Bitfinex is the only exchange with a fiat currency pair in the top five. OKEx’s TRUE/BTC pair is in fifth place as of right now. A very interesting development in the world of Bitcoin trading, and one to keep an eye on. For the time being, we will have to wait and see how the Bitcoin price evolves in the coming hours. Given the bearish pressure on the cryptocurrency industry throughout most of 2018, it is evident things are not looking all that great right now. Then again, the rebound will start any day now, and when it happens, it is evident the Bitcoin price- along with most other cryptocurrencies – will see some solid momentum. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T16:24:18.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "001bc119c0166077aca608bec2be7758ad95ec89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCHkAaUT3zvUTQyXAfhvNQXniI76XSsTjBgDovqi8F1OL_qbSuSxeUsThfsXI_VlAWa1xtZUzdxaMZfgQ_yvB5LWQ2jRnmJCOSucVrd.WmpdLManhrstQ5cizJpiV9_dZP", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu", "published": "2018-05-16T18:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526472518_27285790.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "001bc119c0166077aca608bec2be7758ad95ec89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCHkAaUT3zvUTQyXAfhvNQXniI76XSsTjBgDovqi8F1OL_qbSuSxeUsThfsXI_VlAWa1xtZUzdxaMZfgQ_yvB5LWQ2jRnmJCOSucVrd.WmpdLManhrstQ5cizJpiV9_dZP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T18:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu", "text": "1 hour ago International Bitcoin.com 69 The rush of big money into the cryptocurrency market is continuing at full pace and reshaping the global investment landscape. Two recent examples are Coinbase’s new institutional focus and Nomura’s new venture. These stories, and much more, are in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Also Read: NY Regulator Approves Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and Litecoin Trading Coinbase Goes After Big Money Coinbase, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange recently valued at $8 billion , has announced a new suite of services meant to attract more big money players such as the many new crypto hedge funds that pop up all the time. It will launch a cryptocurrency custodian in partnership with an SEC-regulated broker-dealer to a group of initial clients that include 1confirmation, Autonomous Partners, Boost VC, Meta Stable, Multicoin Capital, Polychain Capital, Scalar Capital and Walden Bridge Capital. New offerings also include Coinbase Prime, a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions, and an institutional coverage group headquartered in New York City to provide a higher level of service to these type of clients. “There is clear demand from institutional clients and financial services professionals for more specific solutions with regard to cryptocurrencies that address their sophisticated needs,” said Adam White, Vice President and General Manager of Coinbase Institutional. The company will also be opening a new engineering office in Chicago to continue developing Coinbase Markets, which provides a centralized pool of liquidity for all its products. Over the course of the year it is promised to introduce new features like low latency performance, on-premise data-center co-location services, institutional connectivity and access, and settlement and clearing services. “As a global leader in financial technology, Chicago welcomes innovative companies investing in our city and creating jobs for Chicago residents,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “There is no better city than Chicago for companies that want to put down roots and grow their businesses.” Komainu to Protect Mutual Funds Komainu is a new venture established to help overcome barriers for institutional investment in crypto-assets with a custody solution and offering new services, standards and best practices. Its founders include Tokyo-headquartered global investment bank Nomura (NYSE: NMR), hardware wallet developer Ledger , and Global Advisors, parent company of Coinshares . Jez Mohideen, Global Chief Digital Officer at Nomura, said: “Global investment managers have long been held back from full participation in digital asset markets, limited by operational and regulatory risk. Our new partnership will set the required standards that will bring peace of mind to digital asset investors, and provide tools and products to enable better integration with more traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds.” Jean-Marie Mognetti, Co-Principal of Global Advisors, added: “After 6 years of research, and collaboration with our administration partner and its regulator, we now have demonstrable progress. This partnership is a progressive stepping stone towards the creation of the necessary prerequisites for further growth within the digital asset ecosystem. This will open new and exciting opportunities to global participants and contribute to move digital asset closer to mainstream offerings.” Ledgerx Savings Accounts Ledgerx, the CFTC-regulated cryptocurrency management platform, has launched a new savings account-like product. Ledger Savings uses an underlying call overwrite strategy but offers a simple interface so that users won’t need to know anything about investing in derivatives. It targets a 16% per annum yield with a potential 2x exit at maturity in the event BTC doubles from current spot prices. For launch, the savings product will be offered for 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month maturities, at varied rates. After selecting the product for the desired maturity, the USD amount is available immediately to withdraw but the associated BTC is locked for the duration of the savings product. Rat Poison Squared Fashion If there is one thing that’s true for the cryptoverse, is that it is full of fast moving entrepreneurs. Warren Buffett only bashed bitcoin as “ rat poison squared ” less than two weeks ago, and someone has already found a way to make money from the now infamous glib. Ecoinmerce, a tokenized e-commerce marketplace, has announced the Rat Poison Squared clothing line, to include t-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, and keyrings. “We don’t know exactly what ‘rat poison squared’ is supposed to mean,” said Ecoinmerce COO Rex Chen. “What we do know is that Bitcoin created a very productive ecosystem and spawned the entire cryptocurrency revolution, which is driving innovation in nearly every industry. This clothing line is intended to give Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts pride in their defiance of the status quo and their belief in a better future.” Telegram’s Gram Lawsuit With a seemingly endless torrent of new ICO tokens flooding the market, short and pithy names for these crypto-assets are running out fast. This can lead to people registering coin names just to try and flip them for profit later and to companies to wage battles over who gets to control a certain ticker, as happens with website domain names. The latest example for this is Telegram, which is now reportedly suing a Florida-based venture over the rights to ‘gram’. Did Jennifer Aniston Convinced You to Invest in Crypto? The Texas Securities Commissioner has issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order on May 15 to stop Wind Wide Coin Inc., from fraudulently offering investments in a cryptocurrency trading program. The order alleges that Wind Wide Coin and three sales agents in Houston are offering for sale investments in a cryptocurrency trading program that uses an “automatic trading bot.” The company is promising investors the combination of “no risk” and extraordinarily high returns. The purchase of 0.1 of BTC, for example, will yield 1 BTC 24 hours later, a one-day return of 900%. Further according to the order, Wind Wide Coin is also misleading potential investors by claiming it is a “licensed company” and “legally registered.” And to lure gullible suckers the company’s website has featured endorsements from supposed past investors. To weed out anyone with some common sense, the website used images of celebrities like Jennifer Anniston – which it mistakenly identified as “Kate Jennifer,” an investor. Similarly, a photo of Prince Charles was identified as “Mark Robert,” an investor who provided a testimonial. The same testimonial was then attributed verbatim to a “Johnson Smith,” supposedly another UK investor. What do you think about today’s news updates?

A Decentralized World in Your Pocket Called the HTC Exodus, the smartphone is slated to include a built-in secure hardware enclave and is aimed at “helping underlying protocols expand their base of dedicated nodes, thus expanding the total blockchain ecosystem.” Phil Chen, who has returned to HTC as the company’s Decentralized Chief Officer, writes in a post on Medium : I want to see a world where the end consumers can truly own their data (browsing history, identity, assets, wallets, emails, messaging, etc) without the need for central authorities. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe the mobile hardware layer can contribute significantly to our new decentralized world. Meet @HTCExodus – The World's First Native Blockchain Phone. Reserve yours now: https://t.co/mlCyN0ThQ7 #LetMyDataGo cc @VitalikButerin @starkness @edithyeung pic.twitter.com/MkDDTSGGMv — HTC Exodus (@htcexodus) May 15, 2018 The HTC Exodus will support underlying protocols, including Bitcoin , Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and others. According to Chen, the team is working to support the entire blockchain ecosystem and will, therefore, be announcing a whole slew of new partnerships in the coming months. “Together, we want to craft the best blockchain & decentralized application experiences to end consumers,” he stated. Of course, the phone will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. More interestingly, each Exodus smartphone will purportedly act as a node for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. If successful, every phone would essentially expand the scope of both leading cryptocurrencies. Key members of the HTC Exodus team include Sean Moss-Pultz, Edith Yeung, Chris McCann, Elizabeth Stark, and Dominic Williams. Currently, details regarding the price of the phone are scant. It is also unknown whether or not HTC will go all the way by allowing customers to purchase the phone with cryptocurrency . Nevertheless, Chen hopes the new phone from HTC will open up the world of decentralized systems to a mainstream market. Stated the DCO: We think that the phone can be an agent in the future for decentralization. We want you to hold your own key [through] a secure management method in our phones.

Corgan: Blockchain ‘Bashing’ Bitcoin In a long series of tweets summarizing the event, which ends May 16, Corgan highlighted what he described as “cargo-cult engineering” taking preference among speakers. “It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework,” he wrote Tuesday. Educator Jimmy Song had been first to publicly pan some aspects of Consensus, saying during a panel with a JPMorgan executive that Bitcoin was “the real innovation here.” “I don’t see anything other than buzzwords,” he said, adding on Twitter afterwards that his words “verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking.” 1/ My take on #Consensus2018 so far: It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework. — Johnathan Corgan (@jmcorgan) May 15, 2018 ‘Expensive And Slow Database’ Continuing the theme, Corgan produced a lengthy explanation of why Bitcoin was the only “successful use” of Blockchain technology. “A blockchain is nothing more than an expensive and slow database,” he concluded. It is a necessary but *insufficient* ingredient, and not even the most important one, of a system (Bitcoin) designed to provide monetary sovereignty to its voluntary participants. Quoting Song’s words about “sprinkling Blockchain dust all over a problem and it will be OK,” the core developer likened Consensus atmosphere to “cargo-cult engineering” – the practice of building infrastructure in the hope that material wealth would generate itself by definition. Meanwhile, markets have yet to witness some of the more buoyant predictions from Bitcoin bulls this week come true. Prior to the event, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee announced he expected it to trigger upward price movements which could top 70% compared to levels at the time around $9000. So far, Bitcoin has underperformed, losing almost $1000 as a fresh Mt. Gox sell-off weighs on sentiment as Bitcoin price is currently holding at the $8200 support level.

Interested customers will soon be able to reserve some of these chips. Also read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Readies 7nm Mining Chips Japanese conglomerate GMO Internet Group published its first quarter results for the fiscal year 2018 last week. During the earnings results presentation, the company outlined its plans for the sale of its long-awaited 7nm bitcoin mining chips. GMO is building two versions of the chip, dubbed V1 and V2. The former is the initial prototype of the 7nm mining chip. The latter is for mass production of the 7nm mining chips, which the company plans to use in-house for its own mining operations, sell to the public, and use in cloud mining. V2 is now being designed and will enter the mass production phase in the fourth quarter of this year. Sale of 7nm Chips Starting Soon In its presentation, GMO has revised its mining business plans from the fourth quarter of last year. The company now indicates that its mining operations are initially “based on store-bought mining computers,” and in roughly June the “7nm (V1) operation” will commence and in approximately October the “7nm (V2) operation” will be underway. As for the sale of its 7nm bitcoin mining chips, the company spokesperson told news.Bitcoin.com: We can disclose that accepting reservation will start from Q2 onwards and launch will be Q4 onwards only at this moment. The actual sale dates are not specified. Furthermore, the company says its cloud mining operation will be launched in June. GMO’s Mining Business The mining business was launched on December 20 through GMO’s European legal entity. It comprises three areas: “[1] In-house mining; [2] Develop, manufacture, and sell mining machines; [and 3] Cloud mining.” GMO says “Hash rate is increasing as planned. Amount of mined bitcoin is increasing as expected.” The company added that it has “new businesses at multiple locations in 2 countries,” noting that its hashrate in April was 241 PH/s but is confident that it will reach the target hashrate of 3,000 PH/s by the year’s end. In addition to its mining business, GMO also operates a crypto exchange called GMO Coin and plans to launch a crypto payment service. The company aims “to become No. 1 in the field of cryptocurrency.” Do you want to buy GMO’s 7nm chips? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock and GMO Internet.

The company has fine relationships with local banks and is the only exchange to be licensed from Dutch Central Bank [DNB]. The exchange charges 0.25% fees for trading.\nThe company had earlier informed its users that it would be removing BCH from the platform.

The company will officially stop trading and provide services for BCH from the 15th May.\nAs the website suggests they had given time for withdrawals till the 14th of May. In the limited time frame, consumers were allowed to transfer the BCH into other wallets. Users were warned and suggested with methods to safely transfer the token but the company makes no recommendations.\nAs reported earlier by AMBcrypto, the hard-fork for BCH shall take place on the 15th of May 2018. The upgrades will include the increase in block size from 8 to 32 and changes will be made to adopt smart contracts.\nBCH is ranked number 4 on CoinMarketCap with a market capitalization worth $24 billion.

It could run more than 6 million average U.S. homes, or all of New York City for more than a year.\nBitcoin's vast power appetite is thanks to mining, where computers crunch complex math problems for a reward of more bitcoins. As more miners try to solve the problems, the difficulty of the computations — and therefore the amount of power required — increases.\nAnd this great financial experiment isn't all powered with renewable energy. It's responsible for more than 30 megatons of annual carbon emissions right now — equivalent to more than 7 million cars on the road, or about 1 million transatlantic flights.\nThe good news for the environment is that bitcoin is a scarce resource, and its algorithm rewards fewer coins as time goes on. By 2140, there'll be no rewards left and no reason to run power-hungry mining computers.\nSEE MORE: Bitcoin Took A Wild, Volatile Ride In 2017\nIt's hard to say whether bitcoin will soak up energy until then or if it will start to taper off. It's expensive to run mining operations, but as long as the price of bitcoin is high enough, people will keep mining.\nIf it stays profitable, researchers say bitcoin could eventually be responsible for 5 percent of global energy usage — which could run every data center in the U.S. right now.
