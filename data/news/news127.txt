After surging last December to around $19,500, bitcoin currency value has declined more than 50 percent since the start of the year. On Thursday, amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again — this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400.\nRegardless, Bogart said it’s still a buy. In fact, he said it’s the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream.\nMany of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are “over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.”\nBogart recommended selling coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO.\n“A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart said. “They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.”\nAlternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as “neutral” — and he told investors to hold for now.\nBogart said he’s especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don’t work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on.\nBitcoin, however, should “at least” end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwind.\n“But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,” he said of bitcoin increasing value.\n“Could bitcoin currency trade lower in the future? Certainly,” Bogart said. “But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:08:26.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb77ceeb871d024986cc0058306ee27ec0f7b58b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2VBVZafOLw7wDUzmAtf7rs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb77ceeb871d024986cc0058306ee27ec0f7b58b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2VBVZafOLw7wDUzmAtf7rs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nEarn Bitcoins while using Mozilla Firefox!

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has dropped by 2.5 percent, from $7,580 to $7,350, dipping below the $7,300 mark at one point.\nLack of Momentum Throughout 2018, the bitcoin price has experienced three major corrections on February 7, April 10, and May 25. The initial correction that occurred on February 7 led the bitcoin price to drop from $19,900 to $6,100, by more than 69 percent. The second correction on April 10 prompted BTC to fall from $12,000 to $6,400, by 46 percent. The third and latest correction on May 25 led BTC to decline from $10,000 to $7,200, by 28 percent.\nA trend can be seen in the three major corrections BTC experienced in 2018, which is that every successive correction had smaller sell-offs and narrower correction periods. The initial correction in February lasted nearly two months, while the second and third corrections bottomed out in about a month.\nFollowing the five-month price trend of bitcoin, it is highly likely that BTC rebounds from the $6,800 mark in the short-term, initiating a strong rally in the mid to long-term. After BTC bottoms out at $6,800, the market is expected to experience an accumulation period, leading the value of BTC to increase gradually and secure momentum. Following a continuous accumulation period could be a parabolic rally, driving the value of most cryptocurrencies to grow exponentially.\nDespite the optimistic long-term outlook of BTC, it is important to acknowledge that both BTC and the rest of the market are in a bear cycle and the bear market will likely continue until BTC bottoms out at the higher end of the $6,000 region.\nAnalysts including Willy Woo have shared their vision of BTC falling to the $5,000 region but unless the BTC price falls below the $6,500 mark and fails to sustain the $6,800 support level, a fall below the $6,000 mark remains unlikely.\nAltcoins and Tokens Trading alternative cryptocurrencies and tokens in a highly volatile period and a bear cycle is similar to leverage trading. Because tokens tend to experience intensified movements on both the upside and downside, it will follow the price trend of bitcoin but with larger price movements.\nMost of the tokens that have performed exceptionally well against major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum throughout 2018 have not been able to avoid the bear cycle. 0x, ICON, Zcash, and WanChain, which have demonstrated significant improvements and major developments in regards to scalability, long-term strategy, and technology, have seen a substantial decline over the past month.\nOne evident trend is the lack of investors and traders willing to sell BTC and other cryptocurrencies at current levels. As such, although technical analysis points elsewhere, a fall below the $6,000 mark for bitcoin in the short-term is unlikely and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market is not expected to fall below the $300 billion region.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Cryptocurrency Market Continues to Fall as Bitcoin Price Seeks Support at $6,700 appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T03:28:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a467d60428f9847cfe3c61f592e3566dad8db6fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKEwRVSMBs2MIZpLvauNUQQYZNqVcCtjJnhYF6S8aX8kXwnQbNAS_qIyRgPB7mY3SxLLWqTviO7MxLy7vhu97KoqkWPk4gZkWLcA--", "site_full": "themerkle.com", "site": "themerkle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "British Company Successfully Trademarked the Term ‘Bitcoin’ - CoinRoundup", "title_full": "British Company Successfully Trademarked the Term ‘Bitcoin’ - CoinRoundup", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.coinroundup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/british-company-successfully-trademarked-the-term-bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90224, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a467d60428f9847cfe3c61f592e3566dad8db6fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKEwRVSMBs2MIZpLvauNUQQYZNqVcCtjJnhYF6S8aX8kXwnQbNAS_qIyRgPB7mY3SxLLWqTviO7MxLy7vhu97KoqkWPk4gZkWLcA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "British Company Successfully Trademarked the Term ‘Bitcoin’ - CoinRoundup", "text": "Pin Shares 15\nTrademarks and patents are often frowned upon in the world of cryptocurrency. This decentralized technology is designed to be free and open to everyone. As such, trademarks and patents can cause a lot of unnecessary hindrances. In the United Kingdom, one company successfully trademarked the word ‘Bitcoin’. A Trademark With Major Implications\nTrademarking a commonly used term is not all that straightforward. Although one could obtain a trademark for the term “Bitcoin”, enforcing that trademark will be a different matter altogether. After all, the term Bitcoin has been ‘trademarked’ before, but it was never used to prosecute people using this term irrespective of their commercial interest.\nEven so, one particular company in the United Kingdom somehow managed to trademark the term “Bitcoin” in late 2017. It is a bit unclear how the company went about achieving this and what they aim to do with it moving forward. The current relationship between Monopolip Ltd. and the cryptocurrency industry also remains a bit unclear at this time.\nThe bigger concern is what this approved trademark filing means for the cryptocurrency industry itself. For most people and companies, this will not result in any major changes. One Reddit user, however, explained that he had received a cease and desist letter when using the Bitcoin term in connection with his T-shirt business. Considering that most of his shirts pertain to Bitcoin, there is an issue here.\nEnforcing this trademark filing outside the United Kingdom will be pretty challenging. Within that nation’s borders, however, the situation is quite different. Considering that the aforementioned Reddit user is seemingly running a UK-based shop, there is some legal gray area to explore.\nThere have been a few unsuccessful attempts at trademarking Bitcoin the US over the past few years. That doesn’t mean people will stop trying in the years to come, though. Cryptocurrencies are extremely popular right now, and it is only normal that more people will look to them in an effort to get rich. Using various methods to do so is to be expected, although opting for a trademark filing is pretty bothersome.\nIt will be interesting to see how this situation plays out. The term ‘Bitcoin’ is far too generic to be trademarked, yet the UK government decided to grant the trademark regardless. Whether or not that decision will hurt the industry moving forward remains to be seen. It’s a very peculiar situation that will spark many debates moving forward.

There is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to decline further and it could even break the last swing low of $948 in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price is in a bearish trend below $1,080 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD remains at a risk of more declines towards the $920 and $850 levels.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline\nThis past week, there were sharp declines from the $1,100 swing high in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined and broke a few important support levels such as $1,050 and $1,000. It traded towards the $950 level before starting an upside correction. A low was formed at $948 and the price corrected above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low.\nHowever, the upside move was capped by the $1,050 resistance. It also failed to test and break the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low. BCH price is declining once again and it seems like it could retest the $948 low in the short term. A break below $948 could open the doors for a test of the $920 and $900 support levels. To the topside, there is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a tough challenge on the upside near $1,060 and the trend line. Above this, the last swing high of $1.150 is the next major hurdle for buyers.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly negative in the bearish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is declining towards the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T07:27:05.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "edbd2c69ca79aa385f750e2ff92c0c3d5a62d7cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3C9DMPgG4RGTAOWWGpDi4uFKYCoZYTQrumHfW2Dbbmg.sh.WtV1f_ls5.RW0Tgro5CbhTYjHFX", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Demanded for Safe Return of Beloved Dog – Crypto", "title_full": "Bitcoin Demanded for Safe Return of Beloved Dog – Crypto", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "edbd2c69ca79aa385f750e2ff92c0c3d5a62d7cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3C9DMPgG4RGTAOWWGpDi4uFKYCoZYTQrumHfW2Dbbmg.sh.WtV1f_ls5.RW0Tgro5CbhTYjHFX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matthew Hrones", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Demanded for Safe Return of Beloved Dog – Crypto", "text": "May Matthew Hrones · May 26, 2018 · 5:00 pm A scammer demanded $600 in Bitcoin for the safe return of a North Carolina woman’s dog, hours after the dog had already been found.

Les tactiques entachées dinconduites que le ministère de la Justice (DOJ) et la Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) étudient sont au nombre de deux : l'usurpation d'identité qui consiste pour un commerçant à soumettre une série de commandes et à les annuler une fois que les prix se déplacent dans la direction souhaitée, atteignant leffet escompté ; et le « lavage commercial » qui consiste pour un commerçant à jouer le jeu du vendeur et lacheteur en même temps en donnant une fausse impression de la demande du marché, ce qui incite d'autres acteurs du marché à sengager. Les crypto-monnaies concernées par lenquête sont essentiellement le Bitcoin et lEther, nous rapporte Bloomberg.\nPlusieurs raisons poussent les autorités à sinquiéter du fait que les crypto-monnaies tombent dans lengrenage des fraudeurs, à savoir : la méfiance que les variations de prix sur le marché de la monnaie virtuelle soit le seul fait des tricheurs, les fluctuations brutales des prix qui pourraient faciliter les évaluations et labsence de réglementations comme celles qui régissent les actions et autres actifs.\nCes genres de situations ont incité la Chine à interdire les échanges de crypto-monnaies et le Japon et les Philippines à les réguler. Ce qui a, par ailleurs, contribué à un effondrement qui a envoyé le Bitcoin en dessous de 8 000 $ cette année. Mais cette chute de prix na rien enlevé à lengouement des investisseurs mondiaux attirant de plus en plus l'attention de Wall Street.\nLan dernier, le Bitcoin a connu une l'ascension record le faisant passer de 1 000 dollars en début dannée 2017 à 20 000 dollars au cours de la même année, ce qui a attiré des milliers dinvestisseurs familiaux. Cela a incité les régulateurs à s'inquiéter que les gens investissent dans des crypto-monnaies sans connaître les risques, a rapporté Bloomberg. Par exemple, des dizaines d'enquêtes sur les offres initiales de pièces de monnaie sont ouvertes par la Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), dans lesquelles les entreprises vendent des jetons numériques qui peuvent être échangés contre des biens et services, en raison des soupçons que beaucoup sont des escroqueries.\nLa fraude devient encore plus difficile à cerner dans la mesure où, non seulement, les échanges de crypto-monnaies sont fragmentés sur des dizaines de plates-formes à travers le monde, et beaucoup ne sont pas enregistrées auprès de la CFTC ou de la SEC, mais également la CFTC ne réglemente pas ce que l'on appelle le marché au comptant des jetons numériques ; c'est-à-dire la négociation de pièces de monnaie réelles plutôt que de contrats à terme liés à ces jetons.\n« Il y a très peu de surveillance des transactions manipulatrices, des usurpations d'identité et des transactions de lavage », a déclaré M. Griffin, un professeur de finance de l'Université du Texas. « Il serait facile d'usurper ce marché. »\nCes deux tactiques de spéculations trompeuses quétudie le ministère montrent que lignorance des mineurs contribue à la flambée du prix à lorigine de fausses demandes du marché. Par conséquent, la croissance de l'industrie pourrait être limitée si les investisseurs disposent des outils leur permettant dadopter une approche de vigilance « acheteur averti » sur les plates-formes de négociation.\nLe DOJ, la CFTC et la SEC arriveront-ils à mettre en place pareils outils à la fin de leur investigation ?\nSource : Reuters - Bloomberg , New York Post\nEt vous ?\nQue pensez-vous de linfluence qua la tricherie sur le marché des crypto-monnaies ?\nSelon le fonctionnement des monnaies virtuelles, peut-on sattendre à une solution de la part des régulateurs ?\nLa crypto-monnaie pourrait-elle devenir un jour une valeur sûre non volatile ?\nVoir auss i\nLe cours du Bitcoin s'effondre et les indices boursiers dans le rouge, un éclatement de la bulle du Bitcoin pourrait-il se répercuter sur la bourse ?\nBitcoin : un nouveau record, la cryptomonnaie franchit la barre des 4000 dollars US, notamment, grâce à la forte demande japonaise", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://nypost.com/2018/05/24/doj-launches-criminal-probe-into-bitcoin-price-manipulation/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://www.developpez.com/actu/186621/Le-cours-du-bitcoin-s-effondre-et-les-indices-boursiers-dans-le-rouge-un-eclatement-de-la-bulle-du-bitcoin-pourrait-il-se-repercuter-sur-la-bourse/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-investigation/u-s-launches-criminal-probe-into-bitcoin-price-manipulation-bloomberg-idUSKCN1IP1VM", "https://www.developpez.com/actu/154543/Bitcoin-un-nouveau-record-la-cryptomonnaie-franchit-la-barre-des-4000-dollars-US-notamment-grace-a-la-forte-demande-japonaise/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T05:55:40.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d27d0da729c7511aaeff91024e42a2a34792f853", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5rJqJHfFHpJ_923omm.s9bEnCwxZkWRpOsz4Ymzi8SGebeLPFS7p5axp8hXXUct8bvwwMDf66Bn28cu18rK18wajV5OnO.Q2Q-", "site_full": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors - ...", "title_full": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors - ...", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.073, "main_image": "https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/bitcoin-magazine-week-in-review3.max-800x800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d27d0da729c7511aaeff91024e42a2a34792f853", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5rJqJHfFHpJ_923omm.s9bEnCwxZkWRpOsz4Ymzi8SGebeLPFS7p5axp8hXXUct8bvwwMDf66Bn28cu18rK18wajV5OnO.Q2Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shawn Gordon", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors - ...", "text": "27 May\nCryptocurrencies and exchanges were the focus this week.

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China. They can also be followed through Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and Wechat accounts.

There are numerous discussions regarding Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash fees in this regard. It now seems the average Bitcoin transaction cost is lower than that of BCH. As is usually the case, such a temporary snapshot can look very different in a few hours. The Bitcoin Fees in Perspective\nWhen directly comparing BTC with BCH fees , it seems there is no real contest. The cost of a Bitcoin Cash transaction has been far lower compared to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In fact, the BHC costs have been relatively flat for quite some time now. Bitcoin’s fees, on the other hand, are erratic as they have always been. Bitcoin fees have been lower than BCash fees in the last 6 hours. pic.twitter.com/XAll68BbC9\n— Ben Verret (@verretor) May 27, 2018\nHowever, temporary snapshots often tell a different story. The Tweet by Ven Verret shows the BTC fees are lower than BCH in a six-hour period. An interesting development, albeit one that only tells a small part of the story. The screenshot itself shows these fees for Bitcoin have spiked just an hour or two prior. Why that sudden increase took place, remains a bit unclear at this time.\nThis doesn’t mean Bitcoin has suddenly become cheaper to use. When timing transactions correctly, that may be the case temporarily. Additionally, users with patience can still send transactions at 1 Satoshi per byte. It may take several hours to confirm, but it is another interesting option worth exploring. When looking at the bigger picture, however, BCH remains the cheaper option by quite a margin. The Debate Continues\nAs is usually the case when trends like these are pointed out, the public backlash is palpable. Bitcoin Cash supporters do not take kindly to this development. However, they also point out how their average TX fee is 0.24 cents or lower. That is quite cheap, although others will argue this point. The overall use of the BCH network compared to Bitcoin is very different.\nThe bigger question is how this situation will evolve. More specifically, there is a growing need for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions . The Lightning Network may effectively provide that functionality. Thanks to the growth in payment channels, it seems this logical development may occur pretty soon. Even so, the technology is still in beta testing, and an “official” launch has not yet been announced.\nDevelopments like these are interesting to keep an eye on. However, keeping the bigger picture in mind needs to be a top priority first and foremost. That picture clearly shows Bitcoin has the highest market cap and Bitcoin Cash remains the altcoin. It also shows Bitcoin has higher fees in general, and that situation may not change soon. As such, the current status quo between BC and BCH will not swing in favor of either currency.

These stories and many more were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief. And the most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest in crypto.\nAlso Read: US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture\nYou could not have missed the impact of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force this week, not with all the emails you must have received from any service that has ever had access to your address. However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. Crypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics\nThe intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday . We reported that Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. And in the US, Congressional candidate Brian Forde raised $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations, and an opponent attacked him for this, referring to his donors as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nWe also reported that Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “Liberation Through Radical Decentralization.” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work. McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip\nJohn McAfee’s prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday . Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert expects. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads. Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nOn Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group’s executive board. And changes to the Volcker Rule give Americans a new reason for moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies, according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Offered for BCH\nThe growing number of bitcoin cash adoptions has been in the headlines on Friday . White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, which offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars, has become the latest business to accept BCH payments. And the online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it started accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. Man Goes All In on Crypto\nThe most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest it all in crypto. The Canadian man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there. As for his crypto portfolio, the unnamed Canadian is currently pinning his hopes on Collosusxt, Fundrequest, Policypal, and Dero.

Recently, British economic historian and author Niall Ferguson told the Bank of England that Bitcoin is the financial system of the future.\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car The Future of Finance\nNiall Ferguson is a noted historian, commentator, and the author of fifteen books including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild. On Tuesday he has given a seminar to the Bank of England, talking about the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it to this day. In his conclusion of the subject, he mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based system.\nFerguson said: “The financial system of today is not fundamentally that different than the financial system of the pre-crisis period, except that big banks are better capitalized. I don’t think much else is really different. The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that’s the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018. In short, I am left feeling we are only a matter of time before the next crisis.” Bombarded by ICOs\nThe above isn’t such a surprising statement coming from Ferguson. Back in December 2017 he wrote : “At some point, no doubt, regulatory changes in the US will deflate the current bitcoin bubble. But they will not halt, much less undo, this financial revolution. Think about it this way. The maximum number of bitcoins that can be created is 21m. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000. I am not saying this is certain to happen. I’m just saying my teenage son thinks it could.”\nSince then he has also been exposed to more sides of the cryptocurrency market, such as the endless flood of ICO offers. “I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson reportedly said last week. “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.”\nFerguson isn’t the only noted academic figure that looked at how bitcoin fits economic history recently. Last Monday, Professor Robert Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel prize in economics and is famous for the Case-Shiller Index, published an article talking about the way the allure of bitcoin fits enthusiasm around previous attempts to reinvent money.\nWhat role in the economy do you see Bitcoin fulfills in ten years from now?

Known as Bitcoin Incognito, it is another attempt at fixing some of the glaring issues which Bitcoin presents. Whether or not this new fork will succeed is unclear, but more competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Anonymity and Bitcoin in one Package\nOne of the biggest misconceptions people have about Bitcoin is that it is anonymous. That is anything but the case, though, as Bitcoin has neither anonymity nor privacy features. The currency allows one to be pseudonymous – similar to an online nickname – but not anonymous. Some projects are trying to address this lack of anonymity through various means.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Incognito , there isn’t much information to go by at this time, as the project was only announced Friday afternoon. From what little information has been made public, it’s evident Bitcoin Incognito will primarily focus on proof-of-stake and masternode solutions.\nAnyone who has paid close attention to the various altcoins on the market will have noticed that masternodes are quickly becoming more popular. It is a system that many currencies are embracing, although it is not something one would ever see as being part of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin Incognito thinks it is a good time to take the plunge in this regard, although it remains to be seen how this will pan out when combined with proof-of-stake capabilities.\nAdditionally, the new project will make use of the Zerocoin protocol to provide anonymity features. It will convert publicly visible BTCi into fully anonymous zBTCi. Sending the anonymous version will appear as normal BTCi to the recipient, but there will be no traceable route indicating where the money came from exactly. It is somewhat similar to how other currencies using the Zerocoin protocol operate. Furthermore, it seems Bitcoin Incognito will make use of a feature known as SwiftTX. This is not a unique feature, as it is found in a fair few altcoins. Even so, it will allow Bitcoin Incognito’s users to send transactions faster and cheaper compared to Bitcoin and most altcoins.\nIt is evident that the project has some interesting ideas, although it remains to be seen whether this particular altcoin will gain any major traction. Various newer versions of Bitcoin have popped up in recent months, yet none have made any lasting impact other than Bitcoin Cash. Changing this situation will not be all that easy, but that doesn’t mean launching new projects is no longer worth it.

Coinbase doesn't directly bet on the price of bitcoin, but instead makes money by collecting fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency.\nCoinbase enjoyed eye-popping growth in late 2017 as small investors piled into bitcoin. It now boasts of more than 20 million customers -- more than Charles Schwab Corp., which has 10.8 million active brokerage accounts.\n\"In U.S. markets, Coinbase is just way ahead of everyone,\" said Ari Lewis, co-founder of crypto hedge fund Grasshopper Capital. \"And they're not standing still with the retail stuff.\"\nBut the end of bitcoin mania raises questions about whether Coinbase's success has peaked. Its exchange handled about $8 billion worth of digital-currency trades in April, down 78% from its record volume in December, according to CryptoCompare.\nRegulators could also trip up Coinbase's quest to broaden bitcoin's appeal. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned in March that many crypto trading platforms were potentially unlawful. Coinbase has approached the SEC and U.S. bank regulators about obtaining various federal licenses, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nCoinbase was founded in 2012 by Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb Inc. software engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. foreign-exchange trader. Mr. Ehrsam left in 2017 but remains on the firm's board.\nWhen Coinbase launched, bitcoin was little known outside a small circle of enthusiasts, many of them libertarians inspired by the idea of a currency outside government control.\nCoinbase always aimed to take bitcoin mainstream, say current and former employees. A major goal was to make it easy to exchange so-called \"fiat\" currencies -- dollars, euros and so on -- for bitcoin. That wasn't always straightforward: Early on, one popular way was for bitcoin aficionados to arrange meetings at Starbucks and swap the digital currency for cash.\nAt a time when bitcoin was widely associated with crime, Coinbase cooperated with U.S. authorities. It registered as a money-services business with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2013 and has since amassed 41 state licenses.\nThat helped Coinbase avoid the fate of rivals such as BitInstant, whose founder, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014 in a case linked to the Silk Road underground narcotics bazaar. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business and spent about a year and a half in prison. \"The early days of crypto were very much like the Wild West, with very little legal clarity,\" Mr. Shrem said in an email.\nOther bitcoin exchanges failed after hackers stole investors' funds. But Coinbase says it has never been hacked. \"Not being compromised is one of the big reasons that Coinbase is what it is today,\" said Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early employee who now leads crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital.\nCoinbase has had its share of growing pains. The company says its user base doubled from August to December. That led to overloaded systems and customers unable to reach tech support.\nAbout 1,530 complaints have been filed about Coinbase with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so far this year, more than American Express Co. and PayPal Holdings Inc. combined, according to CFPB data.\nNikhil Thomas, an IT analyst in Maryland, was unable to access his Coinbase account for four months because of a problem verifying his identity. Calls and emails to customer service yielded few results, and he missed out on thousands of dollars in profits as bitcoin tumbled, he said. \"The ordeal was painful,\" Mr. Thomas said in an interview.\nCoinbase declined to comment on Mr. Thomas's experience, but says it was overwhelmed as its user base mushroomed. \"As a result of this unprecedented demand, some customers had a poor experience,\" Dan Romero, general manager of Coinbase's retail business, said in an email.\nOver the past three months, Coinbase has expanded its customer-support team by more than 150% and resolved 95% of its outstanding requests for help, Mr. Romero added.\nCoinbase has faced other controversies. In December, it vowed to probe allegations of insider trading after suspicious market moves accompanied the introduction of Bitcoin Cash, a bitcoin offshoot, on Coinbase's exchange. The price of Bitcoin Cash climbed 28% in the 24 hours before Coinbase announced the launch, fueling rumors that some traders had been tipped off in advance.\nA spokeswoman declined to discuss the insider-trading allegations, citing pending lawsuits. Coinbase has previously said it prohibits employees from trading on nonpublic information or sharing it with people outside the company.\nThere is no guarantee that Coinbase will maintain its lead over rivals. Robinhood, the free stock-trading app with more than four million users, added cryptocurrency trading in February. That could erode Coinbase's hold over retail crypto investors.\nMr. Thomas is considering Robinhood after his frustrating experience. \"Coinbase works beautifully,\" he said, \"until you have a problem.\"\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\n(END) 27, 2018 07:14 ET (11:14 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ari lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alexander osipovich coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "charles schwab corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:46:36.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73bf5093f2c83570be345782703c2e20be68ae4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pLegABfKMjHMIY_pNYgM0FcUzl6HAdIkY2.eqplfRw85qW3OAjCG1z8eue0sHlx7m9nvhfdaSVg8sPKtdSD53rRBH.OI7RwmNalcFLbfgV2s", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "3 Things Not to Do When Bitcoin is Going Down – Reza Jafery – Medium", "title_full": "3 Things Not to Do When Bitcoin is Going Down – Reza Jafery – Medium", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.057, "main_image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*43ZnNZEOgqvXWj9V.", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 20}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73bf5093f2c83570be345782703c2e20be68ae4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pLegABfKMjHMIY_pNYgM0FcUzl6HAdIkY2.eqplfRw85qW3OAjCG1z8eue0sHlx7m9nvhfdaSVg8sPKtdSD53rRBH.OI7RwmNalcFLbfgV2s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Things Not to Do When Bitcoin is Going Down – Reza Jafery – Medium", "text": "Do as I say, not as I do. Cofounder @Mesmr, Marketing Lead @BlockchainWarehouse, Cofounder @LVLUPDojo May 27 3 Things Not to Do When Bitcoin is Going Down Trading or investing in cryptocurrency is a psychological war against yourself. Stock traders often say that investing in traditional markets requires extreme mental discipline. That discipline is how they control themselves when the market is volatile. How they stop from making stupid decisions, and keep on track with their strategy. If traditional trading requires extreme discipline, crypto requires the mental fortitude of Jedi. The crypto market is more volatile than any market the world has ever seen. You need to be the emotional equal to Yoda meditating on top of a mountain during a meteor shower. Yes the world might be ending, but it’s all good, you’re hanging out on your mountain top. Photo by Ian Stauffer on Unsplash Your fortress of solitude. I’ve been in this space for a few years now. I started off as a investor but fell deeper down the rabbit hole. I work with an accelerator helping token sales , and recently joined the team of a project I fell in love with . I like to think this gives me a comprehensive understanding of fundamentals at play What this understanding of the players involved in this market has given me is.. Well, the knowledge that this market is almost completely sentiment driven. Which means it doesn’t always make sense . Crypto has more retail investors than any other market. You can see this if you look at the Bitcoin price chart next to a chart of Google search trends for the word “Bitcoin”. The charts are pretty similar, it would seem, The more people that google Bitcoin, the higher the price goes. The Search Volume graph seems more smooth because less data points were used to plot the graph. Bitcoin Price Over 12 Months Bitcoin Google Search Volume Over 12 Months The search volume actually starts to pick up just before the price goes up. When a market is sentiment driven, price movement is driven by emotion. To come out on top in a market driven by emotion, you have to remove emotion from your trading. The reason I’m telling you all this is so you understand that it’s not always about what you do, but what you don’t do. It’s what you refrain from, when exhibiting that mental fortitude we talked about. When the price of Bitcoin goes down, and you watch all of your cryptocurrency holdings lose their value, it’s hard to remain calm. When the market gets bloody, you might even be wondering if Bitcoin will ever go back up again. I don’t have a crystal ball, but can say with a good amount of confidene that it will be Don’t try to catch the exact bottom. If you’re lucky enough to have some of your investment capital in fiat or BTC when the market takes a tumble, it can be a good time to construct your portfolio. I like to think of market corrections as “Crypto Flash Sales”. I almost always keep some fiat or BTC tucked away in case of a large dip in the market — but my obsession with catching the bottom of a downtrend has made me lose out on some big wins. When you’re staring at a coins chart, watching it plummet in price, wondering when it will stop. You’re trying to catch the bottom. “Catching the bottom” means you’re attempting to enter into a trade at a bottom of a downtrend. It’s extremely difficult to catch the exact bottom on a trade. So difficult that it’s often called, “catching a falling knife”. Photo by Thanh Tran on Unsplash If you’re constantly trying to catch the exact bottom, chances are you’re going to miss out on trades. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve waited, and waited, only to have a trend reverse before I got in. I’ve missed out on far more than I’ve gained by trying to be a perfectionist with my trade entries. Sometimes, if you’re planning on entering a trade, it’s better to just get in near the bottom rather than wait. If you’re a technical analysis wizard, the likes of Gandalf the White or my friends at Cosmic Trading : you might be better equipped to catch bottoms. This isn’t directed at you. This is for everyone else, the retail investors that make up the majority of this market. You’re not the Wolf of Wall Street, and you’ll bank more coin if you stop thinking you are. Don’t sell your coins for ones that are going up. Everyone’s done it. You don’t have to be ashamed. It’s only human. We’ve all sold the bottom of a downtrend only to see it immediately reverse and shoot upwards. It seems like everytime I abandon ship on a coin to FOMO into another one, the coin I sell goes up. FOMO stands for Fear of Missing Out, it’s a common fear that causes a lot of bad decisions in trading. Let me paint you a picture. You buy $XYZ at $0.25 cents, you’ve done your due diligence, studied the charts for a while, and you’re ready. You didn’t even try to catch the bottom, you know this is a long term hold so you’re fine with your entry. You’re cool as a cucumber. Two weeks pass, $XYZ is still at $0.25 cents. You’re starting to question your beliefs, sense of logic, even your reality. You start getting into arguments with old people at Denny’s about what “money” means. The longer your bag sits firmly on the ground and not the “moon” , the more bitter you become. Two more weeks pass. $XYZ is at $0.20 cents. You’re friend John who just got into crypto last week told you about some sh*tcoin called $ABC. You laugh at him for even considering any coin besides $XYZ. Then, a mere 6 hours after John buys $ABC it skyrockets. It goes up 70%, John thinks he’s the king of crypto. He offers you advice, knowing that your coin is still in the gutter. It’s at this fateful moment that you lose sight of what is most important. Your strategy. “ Screw it! ”, you exclaim. “This market doesn’t make sense if it rewards idiots like John”, you think. After all, he’s only been trading for 12 hours and he’s up 80%, what kind of sick joke is this. He already got that promotion over you, and now he’s getting all the good trades?! The next day John’s stupid $ABC coin goes up 150%. You stare out your window, not at the beautiful LA skyline, but at the street below. Wondering if jumping out the window would hurt less than watching John tell everyone in the office what “Hodl” means as he waves around his hardware wallet. You get home, open up your exchange, and say goodbye to $XYZ. You sell all your holdings, at a loss, and move your capital into $ABC. The next day, $XYZ goes up 800%. John calls you, excited, “Congrats! I saw $XYZ mooned today, oh man I wish I got out of $ABC while I was ahead, It’s down now, practically the same as when I got in. I should have listened to you and bought $XYZ”. Don’t be that person. I’ve been that person, it sucks. Don’t stare at the charts all day. Believe it or not, you can’t force a chart to go up or down with Jedi Mind Tricks. Sorry for all the Star Wars references, I watched the Han Solo movie last night. Trust me, I’ve tried. When I first started trading I used to spend countless hours “charting”. Looking back, if I’m being honest with myself, a lot of those hours were wasted. Sure, I spent a lot of time actually studying and applying what I learned to my trading, but I also spent a lot of time aimlessly staring at a computer screen for hours on end. I learned that the majority of my mistakes where made in moments like those. When I wasn’t being productive, I was needlessly monitoring my holdings like a hawk. It made me more emotional, and it made me overtrade. Two things I now know to avoid at all cost. Sometimes the best thing you can do, is set a limit-order, and walk away. Trust your strategy, and always remember —  if you’re not trading with a strategy, you’re gambling. — — — — — — — — — — — If you want to learn more about trading, technical analysis, or even just chat about the market Stop by Cosmic Trading and say hello, my Discord handle is RezaJates#5824 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T02:00:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d47942320896d1965278d933a2dba64ae595edb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JiI33rCgHUNQ35ltdGg.lWvemn7YaayAZ5w078AqrKrarhdDlnjTb9upZhHQ.nBSzov2EOamsUrfEJ73e.UrFZRjmWihhVFZiH9uowYzJTS6IhvYbmxp9Z", "site_full": "ezquickstore.com", "site": "ezquickstore.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors - Crypto News & Info", "title_full": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors - Crypto News & Info", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ezquickstore.com/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-magazine-week-in-review3.width-800-10.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d47942320896d1965278d933a2dba64ae595edb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JiI33rCgHUNQ35ltdGg.lWvemn7YaayAZ5w078AqrKrarhdDlnjTb9upZhHQ.nBSzov2EOamsUrfEJ73e.UrFZRjmWihhVFZiH9uowYzJTS6IhvYbmxp9Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors - Crypto News & Info", "text": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation\nAs reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.

Verge Cryptocurrency Suffers Its Second Hack in Less Than Two Months\nWhile Verge executives are claiming a DDoS attack is responsible for the recent serious delays on their blockchain, it appears that the problem may be more serious than the company is implying. The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $1.7 million) being stolen. The theft occurred when hackers exploited a specific glitch in Verge’s technology by mining multiple blocks virtually one second apart using the same algorithm. This was the same tactic used in a hack just last month that saw over 250,000 XVGs disappear into thin air, forcing Verge to prepare a subsequent hard fork .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Many crypto enthusiasts speculate that it might be a week full of struggle for Bitcoin that has touched below $7,500 USD mark in the past few days. More If the crypto market sentiments weren’t depressing enough, regulatory news and chatter from all around the world are indicating tough times ahead for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is taking continuous blows and recovery seems pretty tough. But what caused this situation and how much damage has been done? Let’s find out in the remainder of this article. The Idea behind Bitcoin The world’s first and largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is famous for being the decentralized peer-to-peer network. The idea of not depending on any governing authorities’ networks and not being controlled by any person is why Bitcoin is believed to be perfectly designed for hassle-free payments and money transaction between two people. Bitcoin’s anonymity has attracted the attention of many entrepreneurs and crypto enthusiasts who developed altcoins based on bitcoin’s technology aiming to perfect its functionality. Bitcoin has now spread across the globe and is being used for payments as well as trading another crypto. Recent Failed Bull Breakout The failed bullish breakout has Bitcoin prices in deep waters. The decline started on Sunday when bitcoin failingly attempted a comeback. Bulls could only raise the price point to $8,644 USD and since then the market has been tumbling down to approximately $8,240 USD which has currently gone down to $7,300 USD. There are several reasons for which bitcoin markets and cryptocurrency market as a whole is experiencing such extreme bearish trends. Analysts have pointed out that it may have to do with the Chinese ICO markets being highly active and resulting in strict regulatory actions. The Chinese government has officially announced that it deems shady ICOs as great risks and that the government watchdog is keeping a close eye on excessive speculation, fraudulent profit schemes, and fake propaganda. Reasons Affecting Bitcoin Global Prices The major reasons that might’ve caused the current bitcoin market condition are; initial Mt Gox sell-off which made bitcoin lose $9,000 USD footing, the recent scandals which shot down Upbit, biggest cryptocurrency exchanges of South Korea and also the recent Bitfinex taxation policy which is under extreme criticism by crypto investors worldwide. Bitcoin markets experienced high losses when the news broke out regarding initial Mt Gox sell-off. The executives who are in charge of refunding users of Mt Gox before its hack apparently sold around 8000 BTC which amounts to be approximately, $70 million USD. Around the same time, Upbit which is known as one of the most influential crypto exchange located in South Korea was suddenly investigated by Financial Supervisory Commission. FUD spread like wildfire and millions of traders assumed that Upbit which is a subsidiary of communications Influencer Giant ‘Kakao’ might’ve been compromised. After some time, an official announcement came out from Upbit confirming that there haven’t been any raids of any sort and that the motive of FSC, as well as the Korean police force, was an investigation and that the exchange platform remains functional. The most recent negative sentiments around bitcoin price arise from Bitfinex newly implemented taxation policy. On 17 th May, Bitfinex requested some of their users to forfeit their Tax IDs and also their social security number which the government of the British Virgin Island (Bitfinex headquarter) may exchange with tax authorities of the country to which the user belongs. This idea was immediately boo-ed by crypto enthusiasts and influential trading groups such as Whalepool which publicly announced that they’ll stop using Bitfinex unless the taxation policy remains. Bitcoin Market Position Even at the current crypto market’s slump, there’s no denying that Bitcoin still holds the place of the biggest cryptocurrency of the world. The individual price has dropped to approximately $7,340 USD. the current position is still miles away from recovery point and analysts say that unless BTC crosses the barrier of $8,500 USD, there won’t be any bullish breakouts. It is still uncertain whether bitcoin prices will manage to recover from the current market trends and reaches the resistance level.

There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $7,200 and $7,000 support levels to avoid a major downside break.\nBitcoin price is trading well below the $7,600 pivot level against the US Dollar. If BTC/USD breaks the $7,000-7,200 support, there could be heavy declines.\nBitcoin Price Decline\nThis past week, there were heavy losses from the $8,500 swing high in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke two important support levels at $8,150 and $7,900. The decline was such that the price even broke the $7,600 pivot level. It traded close to the $7,000 level and found support near $7,200. A low was formed at $7,220 before the price started consolidating in a range.\nIt traded a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,220 low. However, buyers failed to gain momentum above the $7,600 pivot level. Therefore, the price is in a downtrend below $7,600. More importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. A break above the channel resistance and $7,650 is needed for an upside push . Above $7,650, the next hurdle for buyers sits around the $7,950 and $8,000 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is struggling to recover above $7,600. On the downside, there is a crucial support at $7,200.

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China. They can also be followed through Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and Wechat accounts.

Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities.\nIt’s a debate that matters for the sprawling U.S. national security apparatus, which has to keep track of more than 4 million people with some form of security clearance. That includes workers who, at least in theory, could sell secrets to America’s enemies with the aid of anonymous transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies.\nTerrorists and cybercriminals use cryptocurrencies to shield their transactions from investigators and often demand payment in bitcoins and other digital assets, according to international law-enforcement groups including the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre.\nAt the same time, young investors have decamped from the halls of prominent financial institutions for the evolving world of cryptocurrency investing, and entire states have pegged their futures to its popularity. The instrument is going mainstream as Goldman Sachs moves forward with bitcoin trading operations.\nNevertheless, bitcoin has fallen about 50 percent from its December high to about $8,200 as regulators around the world continue to evaluate how to manage digital assets and some Wall Street pros dismiss the market. Warren Buffett, for example, has likened bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nIf the U.S. government were to decide that owning cryptocurrencies is a security risk, it could have a “huge negative impact” on the growing market, according to Singh.\nAny move to more closely investigate job applicants who own cryptocurrencies also could hamper the Pentagon’s efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace, a goal that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has made a priority.\n“If we’re going to say that if you’ve got a bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren’t going to sit around waiting to try to onboard for a government job,” Greg Touhill, a retired Air Force general who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said in an interview. “It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.”\nThe Pentagon has sent conflicting messages about how it’s handling the matter.\nAfter a Defense Security Service employee suggested in an email that bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and reported on the lengthy SF-86 security form filled out by clearance applicants, DSS quickly countered by issuing official guidance saying . . . there is no official Department of Defense guidance, according to ETHNews, an online cryptocurrency news site.\n“There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies,” according to a statement posted to the DSS website. “DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry.”\nThe equivocation has been cited by law firms and job search sites. ClearanceJobs.com put it bluntly: “Should you report your bitcoin to your security officer? It depends upon who you ask.”\nThe lack of clear direction from the Pentagon only adds to the headaches already faced by government contractors that need to hire workers with security clearances.\nTheir top priority is overhauling a clearance system with a backlog of more than 700,000 background investigations and billions of dollars in associated costs.\nRaytheon Vice President Jane Chappell told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that fixing the clearance system should be a priority for the country and that the backlog was hurting “programs that provide critical warfighter capabilities.”\nFor now, it appears the Pentagon needs further information from the country’s financial regulators. Without a clear policy from the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to issue guidance, according to Singh.\nIn the U.S., bitcoin isn’t treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman, but Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors virtual currency exchanges to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\nIf the U.S. government were to assess that bitcoin is a form of foreign currency, “such activities could have an impact on a security clearance determination,” Maj. Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nThe government should keep in mind that owning cryptocurrencies may not indicate bad intent, said Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.\n“I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk,” Aftergood said. “Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk.”\nBut Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinize clearance applicants who own cryptocurrencies, even those who are buying and holding them as investments, known as “HODL’ers.”\n“Since bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” he said. “As for the HODL’ers, eh, they will pass through the clearance process okay because it’s clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?”\nPrint Email Gmail", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:34:44.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2ab001731b0cdd01fb4a91f1ba86c0316e56f59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVyuCKdnEt5Asuo6ZKpnzadZ4z84hfkhwtapgR0pv_WUcn.wtGeeNB8StwGyCnI.NGh7HiClOLKhw-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Chilean Bank Reopens Accounts of Cryptocurrency Exchanges - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Chilean Bank Reopens Accounts of Cryptocurrency Exchanges - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.034, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chile-banks.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2ab001731b0cdd01fb4a91f1ba86c0316e56f59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVyuCKdnEt5Asuo6ZKpnzadZ4z84hfkhwtapgR0pv_WUcn.wtGeeNB8StwGyCnI.NGh7HiClOLKhw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kevin Helms", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chilean Bank Reopens Accounts of Cryptocurrency Exchanges - Bitcoin News", "text": "Chilean Bank Reopens Accounts of Cryptocurrency Exchanges Date:\nFinance Sponsored Links\nFollowing the court order for three major banks in Chile to reopen current accounts of crypto exchanges, Cryptomkt and Buda.com, one bank has complied. Bancoestado has reportedly made arrangements to open an account for Cryptomkt exchange, which expects to resume cryptocurrency transactions in the coming days.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Bank Reopens Crypto Accounts\nBancoestado, the only public bank in Chile, on Thursday “finalized the first [re]opening of a current account for Cryptomkt, as confirmed by Martín Jofré, founding partner of the cryptocurrency platform,” La Tercera reported.\nThe move follows the order by Chile’s Tribunal for the Defense of Free Competition (TDLC) in April for three of the country’s largest banks to reopen the accounts of two crypto exchanges. Bancoestado, Scotiabank, and Itaú were all ordered to reopen bank accounts of Cryptomkt and Buda.com.\nItaú is a subsidiary of Brazilian bank Itaú Unibanc; Scotiabank Chile is the Chilean unit of Canada’s Scotiabank. Following the court’s order, they appealed the decision, but the court rejected the appeal and confirmed that they must reopen the bank accounts of the two crypto exchanges while the case is still pending.\nAccording to Jofré, when the banks announced the closing of his exchange’s accounts, “in five days they returned 99.8% of the funds to the clients of Cryptomkt, so now they will start from scratch,” the publication described.\nNonetheless, Diario Financiero reported that the exchange “expects to resume the digital currency transaction market in Chile in the coming days.” Banks Appealing to Court\nWhile Bancoestado has reportedly been in contact with Cryptomkt to reopen the exchange’s bank account, Scotiabank and Itaú are expected to “appeal to the precautionary measure approved by the TDLC,” the news outlet detailed.\nBuda.com has not confirmed that its bank account will be reopened. The legal manager of the exchange, Samuel Cañas, indicated after the court’s decision early this month that they will continue to “completely discredit the accusations presented by the banks in their brief, which demonstrate a serious ignorance of our business and the economic institutions that support our activity,” MSN reported.\nOn Friday, La Tercera quoted Bravo law firm explaining that the only recourse the banks have is to take the case to the supreme court. However, “even if that happens, they must make effective the reopening [of crypto exchanges’ bank accounts] ordered by the TDLC,” the news outlet emphasized.\nDo you think banks will find a way to close accounts of crypto exchanges again?

In fact, there are an estimated three million bitcoins — totalling nearly $33 billion — lost because the retrieval codes have gone missing or the currency owners died without passing the codes onto their next of kin.\nJust ask James Howells — who lost a hard drive with the key to more than $79 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales. media_camera James Howells threw away his Bitcoin key.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” Howells recalled. “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.”\nIn 2008, bitcoin’s alleged creator Satoshi Nakamoto published an open-source code through which bitcoins are “mined” by solving complex calculations, embedded throughout the internet, via extremely powerful computers. There is a finite number of 21 million bitcoins.\nPart of cryptocurrency’s appeal is that it’s anonymous, untraceable and can only be retrieved by the person with the private key. Randomly generated by the Bitcoin algorithm, these can be more than 50 characters long — not exactly something you can memorise.\n“People put them on laptops, storage drives, USBs,” said Brian Stoeckert, a legal consultant in the crypto field. “Lose one of them without having it backed up, and you are out of luck.”\nHowells didn’t realise the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them. “I looked up the price, did the calculation ... and thought, ‘S **tt. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million [$A13 million]. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.”\nHis story echoes a plot line in the recently wrapped season of the HBO show Silicon Valley , where blowhard venture capitalist Russ Hanneman, played by Chris Diamantopoulos, is seen leading a crew of hired trash pickers at the local dump, on a mission to turn up a mistakenly discarded thumb drive that contained the code needed to retrieve his $300 million in bitcoin. media_camera A scene from HBO’s Silicon Valley. Picture: Ali Paige Goldstein/HBO\n“We heard a lot of stories about people having incredibly long numbers [as their pass codes, known as private keys] and losing them,” series creator Mike Judge told The Post . “There’s definitely a part of the tech culture, Silicon Valley in particular, where people take pride in failure. But I don’t think losing a hard drive with your Bitcoin code on it falls into that category. I think it happens more than people want to admit.”\nAtlanta-based software developer Syl Turner, 33, can relate. After mining two bitcoins in 2010, he didn’t give much thought to the cryptocurrency and ended up moving the computer to his attic when he bought a new one.\nThen, “last November, [the value of a bitcoin] hit $10,000 [$A13,200]. Everybody was talking about bitcoin, and it seemed like I should go into the attic to find the computer,” he said.\nHe found what he was looking for but had inadvertently written over the hard drive — erasing his private key. “I’m pretty sure I wrote over it because bitcoin had no real monetary value at the time I did it,” Turner said.\nSo why don’t more people keep better track of their magic numbers? “It’s problematic in that if you have your code written down in too many places, people can find it and take your money,” said Judge. “But if it’s in too few places, you may not be able to find it yourself.”\nWhich can become a nightmare when investors pass away without having shared their private keys with their heirs.\nAccording to Michael Yang, who runs a cryptocurrency exchange in the Bay Area, “One of my friends had half of a bitcoin private key in his hand and half in his [business] partner’s hand. Then the partner passed away.” Now, the living friend cannot access the funds.\n“It’s a tragedy,” Yang added. “They had at least 500 bitcoins”— worth around $5.3 million. (A source close to Mellon’s family, meanwhile, denied they were unable to locate his money.)\nSome believe that bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Nakamoto, may have lost his private key. (Another theory is that he committed suicide and failed to leave the pass code behind.)\n“None of the [1 million] coins he mined have moved,” said Kim Grauer, senior economist with Chainalysis, a Manhattan-based digital forensics firm. “It’s odd that they have not been cashed out.”\nIf an investor remembers at least a portion of a pass code, a talented hacker could potentially use software to decrypt it. For someone like Howells, however, who has no clues to go on, “hacking it would take a couple billion years and require all the energy of the sun”.\nInstead, he’s offered the town of Newport 10 per cent of the bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests.\nFor the time being, Howells views the dump as the ultimate safe. “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having $75 million in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.”\nTurner, however, has learned his lesson and is done.\n“I have no crypto now and have little desire to get more,” he said. “Some [aspects] of it are fascinating. But it also seems like a cult.” media_camera There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created and their worth fluctuates.

It can’t cross that threshold. It is to be noted that eighty percent of all the Bitcoin in existence is already mined.\nThis means there are only four million bitcoins remained and they are being mined at a rapid pace. The estimated number of Bitcoins mined has crossed the 17 million threshold this year.\nAt the current rate the Bitcoin mining will be finished in 12 years. The report on the Blockchain.info states that 16 th million Bitcoin was mined a year earlier and now the seventeenth is also crossed.\nBitcoin was first mined in 2009 and it was claimed then that it will just take about two hundred days to produce one million bitcoin. These claims were very highly optimistic as was shown during the last year that even with highest publicity and crypto momentum, it took almost a year to complete 1 million bitcoin mining.\nThe mining is not as easy as was assumed in 2009. It is complicated and requires immense ingenuity and experience to pull it off. The governmental regulations doesn’t help the miners as Chinese crackdown has demonstrated.\nTheir exodus to the south East Asian countries was not very successful given the logistical nightmares they have been put through. Despite given Russian offers to shift, South East Asia was preferred by Chinese miners.\nSouth Koreans being paranoid has already shown their propensity towards cracking down on the crypto community.\nAnd if one is residing in sub-tropical or tropical environment, good luck to processors to pull that off. The exorbitant electricity cost will get multiplied as it requires further air conditioning installment to slow down the huge processors.\nSatoshi Nakamoto holds 980,000 Bitcoins which comprises almost five percent of all Bitcoin in existence.

This is a near $200 drop over the last 24 hours, and the bears are still having their way.\nThe current sentiment is that bitcoin could fall to as low as an even $7,000 over the next few days. The currency has been dropping gradually since Sunday May 13, after it spiked to a new high of roughly $9,800. Maybe bitcoin just doesn’t like Mother’s Day…\nStill, others remain skeptical that bitcoin will stay at the $7,000 position or spike soon after that. Willy Woo, for example, is a cryptocurrency and digital currency analyst. He believes bitcoin could potentially fall below the $6,000 mark in the short term, and test both the $5,700 and $5,500 marks respectively. He cites a high NVT signal, continuously high volatility, an overly high standard NVT, and a volume profile cliff below $6,800 as the four main reasons for his prediction.\n“NVT signal is still too high,” he explains. “We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely. Furthermore, volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility, which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down.”\nNVT signal is a trading indicator that Woo, himself, developed. It is a standard NVT ratio-network valuation divided by transaction value on the blockchain. The figure is then smoothed out using a moving average, which is then applied to the transaction value, creating a more responsive chart.\nWoo did mention, however, that bitcoin isn’t likely to strike the bottom half of the $5,000 range, and that a price correction as steep as the one witnessed in 2014 would not happen. He further stated that a cryptocurrency bull rally would occur again, though not until the third quarter of 2018.\n“So, in summary, my best guess – slow bleed down to $6,800, then a steeper slide to $5,700, then a leveling out of the drop, then a flat zone,” he explained. “This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement.”\nIt’s hard to accept the idea of bitcoin suddenly sinking into oblivion when so many countries are beginning to explore its technology and benefits. Great Britain, for example, has recently published a working paper on the subject, while the Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney states that the institution is open to the idea of a central bank-issued digital currency.\nThis marks a massive change in sentiment, as prior to the G20 Summit in Argentina last March, Carney had been very vocal about the negative side of bitcoin , repeatedly calling the currency a “failure.” He also said that it needed to be “held to higher standards,” and that cryptocurrencies were part of “speculative mania.”\nCarney now believes a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could potentially heighten the region’s presence in the crypto space and assist Britain’s economy.

Complaints are piling up on social media and forums over the past couple of days, with reports of even users who have been able to get their account successfully verified through the automated process still cannot trade or access their funds.\nAlso read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ Poloniex Customers Complain About Frozen Accounts\nBack in December of 2017, the cryptocurrency trading platform, Poloniex, announced all users especially legacy accounts who were once grandfathered must verify their identity by Q1 of 2018. Soon after the exchange announced this requirement a press leak revealed the exchange was acquired by the firm Circle Financial but representatives denied the acquisition. Then a few months later in February, it was revealed Circle Financial had officially purchased Poloniex and that the firm was taking over the business. Many people believe Poloniex’s verification requirements were due to the Circle acquisition, as the Boston-based firm is very adherent to regulatory policies like AML/KYC laws. This week, many Poloniex customers are seeing their accounts frozen unless they verify their identity. Any time a user wants to trade, or withdraw if their account is frozen this warning pops up even for those who have submitted ID.\nOn the Poloniex Reddit forum, there are a bunch of complaints and gripes about the verification process. One user on Reddit named u/PauleeWorli explains he is still unable to access his account even after completing the automated process.\n“I am a ‘legacy’ user on Poloniex and I was told to verify today when I logged in,” explains u/PauleeWorli . “I did that and promptly got an email reply saying I had been verified — My profile now says I have a ‘level 3 verification’ — the type that allows $25,000 per day.\nBut when I go to trade it tells me ‘account frozen’ when I try to place an order. I did make a ticket and then checked Twitter and it seems many people have the same ‘now verified but still frozen’ problem. Can anyone help me here please? Legacy users who haven’t verified their accounts are greeted by this page. Legacy Customers Say They Didn’t Get An Email Notification Detailing a Specific Time Limit\nThe Reddit post has a bunch of replies with customers explaining they are having the same issues with Poloniex even after verification. On Twitter, the same sentiment can be seen as there are many Poloniex customers grumbling about frozen accounts. One individual on Twitter explains he is angry because he wasn’t notified of the account freeze taking place this week.\n“Something is wrong, Poloniex, I clearly remember you giving warning before 2018 saying after disabling “TRADING” legacy accounts would be able to WITHDRAW their coins,” the customer emphasizes .\nFreezing suddenly? I didn’t even get an email with time limit!\nJust like the many Reddit posts, there are a lot of customers on Twitter complaining about this frozen account issue. At the moment there are currently no official statements on either the Poloniex Twitter page, Reddit forums, or the website itself.\nWhat do you think about the Poloniex freezing unverified accounts?

The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dipped below $ 1,000 for the second time in a few days. This seemingly confirms there are growing concerns regarding the long-term future of this project. Bitcoin Cash Price Struggles are Very Real\nAnyone who has kept an eye on the Bitcoin Cash price this week may have noticed an interesting trend. Despite a somewhat steady price level throughout most of 2018, things have taken a dire turn since this week. With the Bitcoin Cash price dropped from over $ 1,200 all the way to $ 980 in a few days, the setback was pretty steep.\nAt that time, some industry experts speculated Bitcoin Cash has not convinced most investors and speculators. An interesting stance, although it is always subject to interpretation first and foremost. All cryptocurrencies are bleeding value as of right now, thus this “problem” is not unique to BCH whatsoever. Until the Bitcoin value picks up the pace, it seems safe to assume the Bitcoin Cash price will continue to decline as well.\nOver the past 24 hours, there has been a 4.08% Bitcoin Cash price decline. Surprisingly, there is only a 0.92% drop in the BHC/BTC ratio, which seemingly confirms Bitcoin Cash would have a stable value if Bitcoin wasn’t getting manipulated. Even so, it also shows how BCH – just like all other cryptocurrencies – is primarily linked to the Bitcoin value, and right now, the future is not looking all that impressive.\nWith $ 493.313m in 24-hour trading volume , it seems the demand to buy and sell BCH is not slowing down compared to 24 hours ago. It is evident there is a lack of trading volume for all currencies as of right now, but for Bitcoin Cash, the trend doesn’t necessarily look all that bad. Compared to some other top 10 coins, its volume is holding up surprisingly well, at least, for the time being.\nThe way things stand right now, OKEx is the leading exchange in terms of BCH trading volume. Its USDT pair is well ahead of LBank’s BTC pair and HitbTC’s BTC market. EXX and OKEx’s BTC market complete the top five, which means there are no fiat currencies in the top five as of right now. In fact, there’s only one fiat currency pair in the entire top 10, which confirms the Bitcoin Cash price will not reserve course today by any means.\nWhether or not the Bitcoin Cash price can gain control around $ 1,000 is a difficult question to answer right now. While that seems somewhat plausible, it will heavily depend on how the Bitcoin price moves along in the hours and days to come. As of right now, the BTC price seems to be heading lower and lower, which will also push the Bitcoin Cash price down even further. Today won’t be a pleasant day in this regard, albeit stranger things have happened in the past.

IPHoldings South West ’ has successfully acquired a trademark for the name ‘Bitcoin’. According to a merchant on Etsy, IP-Holdings sent a cease and desist order because they were selling Bitcoin-themed t-shirts.\nAlso read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ UK Company Successfully Copyrights the Name ‘Bitcoin’\nThis week cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out the name ‘Bitcoin’ had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK on December 22, 2017. The news came as a shock to one merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was told to stop his operations or be held liable in a court of law. The letter states :\nIt has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994.\nContacting the company is difficult as there is very little information on the London-headquartered firm called IP-Holdings — minus one other patented IP product called ‘Westworld.’ The trademark itself, filed this past December, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as adult clothing, infants’ clothing, shoes, headbands, socks, and nearly everything that can be manufactured into a product. Trademark number ‘UK00003279106 Bitcoin’ was officially registered into the IPO’s records on April 13, 2018. The “BITCOIN” IPO trademark filed on December 22, 2017. Other Attempts to Trademark the Bitcoin Name Have Failed\nThe UK filing seems to be the first successful trademark using the name Bitcoin as there have been other undertakings in the past. Back in March of 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the company Urban Trend’s attempt to trademark the name Bitcoin (Reg 86135516 ). A year later during the same month, the Russian patent agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group when it tried to copyright the Bitcoin name .\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been angry about the recent news as prior attempts have infuriated bitcoiners in the past. Back in 2015 the nonprofit organization the Bitcoin Foundation published a plea to individuals and businesses asking them not to copyright the term Bitcoin.\n“The Bitcoin Foundation believes that the term “Bitcoin” alone should not be the intellectual property of any individual or entity,” explained the organization back in January 2015.\nRather, it is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,” “yen,” etc. The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.\nWhat do you think about the UK company trademarking the name Bitcoin and sending cease and desist letters to those who attempt to use the name?

IPHoldings South West’ has successfully acquired a trademark for the name ‘Bitcoin’. According to a merchant on Etsy, IP-Holdings sent a cease and desist order because they were selling Bitcoin-themed t-shirts.Also read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ UK Company Successfully Copyrights the Name ‘Bitcoin’ This week cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out the name ‘Bitcoin’ had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK on December 22, 2017. The news came as a shock to one merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was told to stop his operations or be held liable in a court of law. The letter states : It has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994. Contacting the company is difficult as there is very little information on the London-headquartered firm called IP-Holdings — minus one other patented IP product called ‘Westworld.’ The trademark itself, filed this past December, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as adult clothing, infants’ clothing, shoes, headbands, socks, and nearly everything that can be manufactured into a product. Trademark number ‘UK00003279106 Bitcoin’ was officially registered into the IPO’s records on April 13, 2018. The “BITCOIN” IPO trademark filed on December 22, 2017. Other Attempts to Trademark the Bitcoin Name Have Failed The UK filing seems to be the first successful trademark using the name Bitcoin as there have been other undertakings in the past. Back in March of 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the company Urban Trend’s attempt to trademark the name Bitcoin (Reg 86135516 ). A year later during the same month, the Russian patent agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group when it tried to copyright the Bitcoin name .Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been angry about the recent news as prior attempts have infuriated bitcoiners in the past. Back in 2015 the nonprofit organization the Bitcoin Foundation published a plea to individuals and businesses asking them not to copyright the term Bitcoin. “The Bitcoin Foundation believes that the term “Bitcoin” alone should not be the intellectual property of any individual or entity,” explained the organization back in January 2015. Rather, it is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,” “yen,” etc. The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.

The vast majority of tokens and small cryptocurrencies have followed the price trend of bitcoin and Ethereum. On both the upside and downside, the price movement of tokens intensified, recording larger drops than bitcoin during minor corrections.\nOn May 25, Woo noted that the bitcoin price would likely dip below the $6,000 level and test $5,500 to $5,700 as a long-term support level. In previous reports, CCN noted that the $6,500 mark is an important resistance level which bitcoin has been able to bounce off of since early January.\nIn the short-term, it is likely that bitcoin falls below $7,000 and test the $6,500 resistance level and the failure to remain above that level will likely send bitcoin to the lower end of $6,000 and potentially to the higher end of $5,000.\nWoo named four major reasons to support his call:\nHigh NVT signal High volatility Standard NVT overly high Volume Profile cliff below $6,800 “NVT Signal is still too high. We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely. Volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down,” said Woo.\nbitcoin price More NVT Signal is a trading indicator developed by Woo, which is essentially a Standard NVT Ratio–Network Valuation divided by Transaction Value on the blockchain smoothed using moving average–except that instead of applying the moving average to both Network Valuation and Transaction Value, NVT Signal applies moving average to only the Transaction Value, creating a more responsive chart.\nWhile it is unlikely that the bitcoin price drops to the lower end of $5,000, Woo stated that bitcoin would most likely not be able to hold up in the $7,000 region and inevitably drop down to the $6,000 region.\nBut, because of the intensity of the decline since late 2017, Woo emphasized that 2018 will not see a similar correction period as 2014 and prevent a 2-phase drop.\n“So, in summary, my best guess… slowish bleed down to $6800… then a steeper slide to $5700, then a leveling out of the drop… then a flat zone. This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement,” added Woo.\nBitcoin Price to Rebound from $5,700 In October 2017, after nearly doubling in price within a 3-month period, the bitcoin price achieved $5,700. Falling to the $5,700 region would essentially send the price of bitcoin back by nine months.\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market is significantly different from where it was in October. Its volumes are in orders of magnitude larger and the standard of infrastructure provided by companies like Coinbase and Gemini are unprecedented compared to the platforms that were available in early 2017.\nGiven the difference in the volume and structure of the market in comparison to 2017 and previous years, both Woo and other analysts in the cryptocurrency sector agree that the next bull rally or up cycle for bitcoin will take less time to initiate, possibly in the third quarter of 2018.\nImages from Shutterstock\nThe post Bitcoin Price to Bottom at $5,700 in Short-Term Before Recovery: Analyst appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young willy woo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "woo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:53:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "273f6adb5717201e43536bb36c8fed29fe9a7b12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0Vg6YRjzrrcnFvzCRxE6IYxk4Of6pLEnS_.eIveeg1003xKWCy96z96W_.Yo1RYHakCCYK2BLYFtCVgJ6KAeNQMQyQLVLn0E-", "site_full": "au.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin In The Red Again, Sub-$7,000 Levels Now On The Cards", "title_full": "Bitcoin In The Red Again, Sub-$7,000 Levels Now On The Cards", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8qJnIiYmR7FmdWczM.Vmmg--~B/aD00MjA7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/ffa33b66cc0702eac014205f75df28ad", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "273f6adb5717201e43536bb36c8fed29fe9a7b12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0Vg6YRjzrrcnFvzCRxE6IYxk4Of6pLEnS_.eIveeg1003xKWCy96z96W_.Yo1RYHakCCYK2BLYFtCVgJ6KAeNQMQyQLVLn0E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bob Mason", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin In The Red Again, Sub-$7,000 Levels Now On The Cards", "text": "Bitcoin In The Red Again, Sub-$7,000 Levels Now On The Cards Bob Mason Reblog Bitcoin fell by 1.85% on Saturday, following Friday’s 1.58% fall, to end the day at $7,318.9, leaving Bitcoin down 14.1% for the current week. An early morning rally saw Bitcoin break into $7,600 levels with an intraday high $7,624.1, coming within reach of the day’s first major resistance level at $7,634.53 before easing back to $7,500 levels and a particularly range bound afternoon that left the day’s support and resistance levels untested until a late in the day sell-off. Bitcoin fell through the day’s first major support level at $7,298.63 to an intraday low $7,281 before recovering to $7,300 levels by the day’s end. Failing to break through the day’s first major resistance level, while testing the day’s first major support level reaffirmed the bearish trend formed in early May, with Bitcoin coming nowhere near the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $7,906.4 and $8,000 levels needed to begin a bearish trend reversal. There was no materially negative news hitting the wires to pin Bitcoin back through the day, with investor sentiment continuing to be on the bearish side following news out of the U.S, South Korea and Japan in recent weeks on probes into cryptomarket exchanges and trading practices. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 0.81% to $7,268, with the late Saturday sell-off spilling into the early hours of the day. A start of the day intraday low and new swing lo $7,220 managed to hold above the day’s first major support level at $7,191.9 before recovering to current levels, though the Bitcoin bulls are certainly not out of the woods yet, with Bitcoin’s first major resistance level at $7,535 and 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 some way off. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning’s $7,330.8 high to $7,410 would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $7,535 before any reversal, with Bitcoin investors likely to face plenty of resistance at $7,500, pinning back any run at the day’s second major resistance level at $7,751 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4. Investors have continued to lock in profits early, leading to the downward trend in daily highs, with Bitcoin now having failed to touch $8,000 levels for a 3 rd consecutive day. Failing to move back through to $7,400 levels would support another day in the red, with Bitcoin likely to test the day’s first major support level at $7,191.9 and the second major support level at $7,064.9 before any recovery. How far Bitcoin slides before a bearish trend reversal kicks in remains to be seen, but sub-$6,000 levels will likely be in sight, particularly when considering what’s to come for the cryptomarkets this summer, global and ‘in-country’ regulations expected to hit the markets hard. With Bitcoin in the red, the rest of the majors followed, Stellar’s Lumen seeing the heaviest losses, down 2.97%, with Monero down 2.33% and Bitcoin Cash down 2.37% and things could get worse should hopes of a weekend rally continue to fade through the morning.

Here's why.\nBitcoin is still a buy despite its continued losses, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart told CNBC.\nThe digital currency's increased number of use cases is proof that the popular form of money is being institutionalized.\n\"Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,\" Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC's \" Fast Money \" on Friday.\n\"Either they're going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk,\" he added. \"A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive,\" he said.\nStill, the coin has seen better days. After surging last December to around $19,500, bitcoin has declined more than 50 percent since the start of the year. On Thursday, amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again — this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400.\nRegardless, Bogart said it's still a buy. In fact, he said it's the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream.\nMany of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are \"over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\"\nBogart recommended selling coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO.\n\"A lot of those tokens are overvalued,\" Bogart said. \"They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.\"\nAlternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as \"neutral\" — and he told investors to hold for now.\nBogart said he's especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don't work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on.\nBitcoin, however, should \"at least\" end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwind.\n\"But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,\" he said of bitcoin increasing value.\n\"Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly,\" Bogart said. \"But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely.\"\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/bitcoin-tracking-for-slight-weekly-losses-despite-regulatory-crackdown.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/bitcoin/", "https://www.cnbc.com/cryptocurrency/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:55:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89ff2f606c702c4d26f1bfc9485feeef53b3bbf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWaZZH.7sx2UIfxAuqQNb0cahBBgKVRikGxF6O_aMvlKmi_mvrVxfBh4uHkQovwVhi0Hf6nmDOaFccPqIPKDC7MSp6UYEjka21hCvYUk0syh7e4HYjJL3vFvKiwtwRl64.E-", "site_full": "hellogeneration.com", "site": "hellogeneration.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Roger Ver Interview – Bitcoin, Hate, Jesus to Judas?

It’s assumed to be the first example of such a crime in South Africa including a ransom demand being required in Bitcoin. Kidnappers Demand 15 Bitcoin be Paid for Victim’s Safe Return\nKatlego Marite was snatched on Sunday as he was working with friends in the township of Witbank, South Africa. The last statement his family had received from the kidnappers was a payoff note. Acc. To reports in The Guardian, it stated:\n“THIS IS A KIDNAPPING …WE DEMAND RANSOM OF 15 BITCOINS TO BE PAID INTO THE BELOW BITCOIN WALLET ADDRESS TO SECURE YOUR CHILD’S SAFE RELEASE – NON-NEGOTIABLE.”\nAlso in the note, threats were made against the boy’s life. The first deadline for the amount of the ransom was on Monday evening. Acc. as a police official, the parent’s were understandably distressed by the whole ordeal. He stated:\n“THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS BITCOIN IS. THEY’RE DEVASTATED, AND YOU CAN SEE THEY’RE WORRIED AND ASKING THEMSELVES: ‘WHERE’S OUR SON?”\nCCTV footage from a neighboring property shows the boy being pushed into a silver Toyota Corolla which quickly left the scene. One of his mother’s colleagues informed authorities and the boy's family. The unnamed co-worker of Miriam Marite had gone in search of the car after seeing the private security footage. After he saw a similar se322q 1car outside a local bar and reported it the police were able to detain three men in connection with the kidnapping.\nLocal media outlet TimesLIVE report that no suspects have been arrested or charged as of yet. Acc. to Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, leading suspects, it did not indicate that they would be charged. The three were merely being detained for questioning at present.\nThe publication also stated that it was still unknown if the three suspects were continuing to be held by police or if they had been merely questioned and then published.\nThe kidnapping of Katlego Marite isn’t the first case of such a ransom being created in Bitcoin. Last year, we reported on the case of EXMO Exchange employee Pavel Lerner being taken from outside his office in Kiev. He was released three days later after the million dollars worth of Bitcoin was paid to the kidnappers. There has been no report yet to indicate that those responsible have since been captured.

In London, police officials arrested one particular hacker and seized $667,000 worth of Bitcoin in the process. It remains unclear what will happen to the confiscated Bitcoins, although it seems likely they will be auctioned off. Another Bitcoin-related Arrest\nIt is evident criminals are drawn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for many reasons. One of the main reasons for this is that many people perceive Bitcoin and similar currencies as being anonymous. In reality, however, Bitcoin itself lacks privacy and anonymity features, whereas a few other currencies – such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash – take a completely different approach.\nEven so, criminals will try many different tactics to get their hands on cryptocurrency in one way or another. A hacker known as Grant West has successfully attacked dozens of companies around the globe using phishing scams. By using this method of attack, he was able to extricate sensitive financial data, which was then sold on dark web marketplaces in exchange for Bitcoin.\nEvidence of West’s crimes has been uncovered by the London Metropolitan Police. More specifically, they linked at least 17 different cyber attacks to him. Those attacks were directed at many major UK-based enterprises such as Sainsbury’s and Asda, as well as a Finnish Bitcoin exchange. It’s quite an impressive list, although it is certainly possible that a lot more attacks have yet to be documented.\nIn a raid on West’s home, police officials also recovered a memory card which contained 78 million usernames and passwords. It is unclear what platforms this information pertains to exactly, but it is safe to assume these details were sold on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin. Officials have not commented on which dark web markets were used to sell the stolen information over the past few years.\nWith over $660,000 worth of Bitcoin having been seized, another issue will need to be addressed. It is unclear what the Metropolitan Police will do with this cryptocurrency. In most cases, such holdings are auctioned off to the highest bidder. However, this is the first case of its kind for the 188-year-old department, which means they will first have to devise a course of action.\nUnfortunately, it’s evident that criminals will continue to pay attention to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That is rather worrisome, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has a lot of negative associations with criminal activity already. At the same time, this arrest shows that Bitcoin is not a suitable tool for criminals, as they will be brought to justice eventually.\nFull details at themerkle.com/londons-metropolitan-police-seize-667000-worth-of-bitcoin/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "metropolitan police seize", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:42:44.064+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d96e248f099691e49cb52e4db282635af266c4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_hQoU5vf1pAL5DuAXHi.UQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d96e248f099691e49cb52e4db282635af266c4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_hQoU5vf1pAL5DuAXHi.UQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nEarn Bitcoins while using Mozilla Firefox!

The allegations involve “BitCaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global,” the police unit said in an emailed statement on Friday. “Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent per week and ultimately 50 percent per month.” “BitCaw Trading was not involved in the BTC Global scam and we are shocked to see our name connected with it,” Andrew Caw, who set up BitCaw Trading, said in messages via Facebook on Friday. “BitCaw Trading assists people with buying & selling Bitcoin as well as other Bitcoin related services. We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment” and BitCaw didn’t set up BTC Global, he said. BTC Global’s services are suspended, according to that company’s website. In a statement on the site it blames its financial woes on a former employee. No contact details are given for BTC Global.

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has dropped by 2.5 percent, from $7,580 to $7,350, dipping below the $7,300 mark at one point. Lack of Momentum Throughout 2018, the bitcoin price has experienced three major corrections on February 7, April 10, and May 25. The initial correction that occurred on February 7 led the bitcoin price to drop from $19,900 to $6,100, by more than 69 percent. The second correction on April 10 prompted BTC to fall from $12,000 to $6,400, by 46 percent. The third and latest correction on May 25 led BTC to decline from $10,000 to $7,200, by 28 percent. A trend can be seen in the three major corrections BTC experienced in 2018, which is that every successive correction had smaller sell-offs and narrower correction periods. The initial correction in February lasted nearly two months, while the second and third corrections bottomed out in about a month. Following the five-month price trend of bitcoin, it is highly likely that BTC rebounds from the $6,800 mark in the short-term, initiating a strong rally in the mid to long-term. After BTC bottoms out at $6,800, the market is expected to experience an accumulation period, leading the value of BTC to increase gradually and secure momentum. Following a continuous accumulation period could be a parabolic rally, driving the value of most cryptocurrencies to grow exponentially. Despite the optimistic long-term outlook of BTC, it is important to acknowledge that both BTC and the rest of the market are in a bear cycle and the bear market will likely continue until BTC bottoms out at the higher end of the $6,000 region. Analysts including Willy Woo have shared their vision of BTC falling to the $5,000 region but unless the BTC price falls below the $6,500 mark and fails to sustain the $6,800 support level, a fall below the $6,000 mark remains unlikely. Altcoins and Tokens Trading alternative cryptocurrencies and tokens in a highly volatile period and a bear cycle is similar to leverage trading. Because tokens tend to experience intensified movements on both the upside and downside, it will follow the price trend of bitcoin but with larger price movements. Most of the tokens that have performed exceptionally well against major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum throughout 2018 have not been able to avoid the bear cycle. 0x, ICON, Zcash, and WanChain, which have demonstrated significant improvements and major developments in regards to scalability, long-term strategy, and technology, have seen a substantial decline over the past month. One evident trend is the lack of investors and traders willing to sell BTC and other cryptocurrencies at current levels. As such, although technical analysis points elsewhere, a fall below the $6,000 mark for bitcoin in the short-term is unlikely and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market is not expected to fall below the $300 billion region.

Every minor gain made yesterday has effectively been turned into a net loss once again. All currencies continue to follow the Bitcoin price in this regard, as BTC struggles to remain above $7,300. Bitcoin Price Dip Isn’t Over yet\nIt is evident there is still plenty of negative pressure on all of the cryptocurrency markets today. This is all tightly correlated to how manipulators and speculators continue to push the Bitcoin price down for quite some time now. It is not necessarily a good thing by any means, but this trouble situation has been in place for quite some time now. It seems there will be no change in the Bitcoin price anytime soon either.\nMore specifically, there was some brief positive momentum last night. With the Bitcoin price rising above $7,500 again, most people assumed the bearish pressure was finally relenting. As is usually the case, that was just a brief uptrend which was negated pretty quickly. As such, the Bitcoin price dropped below $7,400 again and is now struggling to maintain any momentum above $7,300.\nWith another net loss of 2.26% in the past 24 hours, it is evident things are not looking all that great right now. The Bitcoin price has steadily lost value nearly every single day throughout 2018, and it seems remaining above $7,000 will prove nearly impossible. Whether or not things will evolve in that direction, remains a bit unclear, as anything and everything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\nEven the Bitcoin trading volume is dropping, albeit that is not entirely unusual during the weekend. More specifically, trading volumes for all cryptocurrencies are on the decline as of right now. When the Bitcoin trading volume drops, altcoins are bound to go with it sooner or later, which is exactly what is happening right now.\nAt the time of writing, Binance is the largest exchange by BT trading volume with its USDT pair. OKEx’S TRUE and USDT are in second and third place as of right now. Bitfinex offers the only fiat currency pair in the five, followed by Huobi’s USDT market. It is evident there is no real money pouring into Bitcoin to stop the outflow, albeit that situation may come to change next week.\nFor the time being, it remains a bit unclear what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Things do not look even remotely impressive right now, and a dip to $7,000 and potentially lower seems nearly inevitable. When that happens, there will be even more panic selling to push the Bitcoin price down even further. All of this remains subject to change, as unpredictable markets will remain unpredictable at any given time.\nFull details at themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-seemingly-heads-toward-7000-as-bearish-sentiment-worsens/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T11:36:29.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b0b7f0ca834a7afe9f1660c468102cb337c724d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8YuhCPz2LZQn63jigLpEzLt0sgz7jIBxiiozliIVvjfHkPuu5UE_vd17pApNFxwrFaKOypzlWvzYERG5FavoGt2uM0hD57evOMDAO5jKBT5l5y0CqjAlOz", "site_full": "www.cryptofinancialreport.com", "site": "cryptofinancialreport.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis April.7 | Crypto Financial Report", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis April.7 | Crypto Financial Report", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.449, "main_image": "http://www.cryptofinancialreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/logo-1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b0b7f0ca834a7afe9f1660c468102cb337c724d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8YuhCPz2LZQn63jigLpEzLt0sgz7jIBxiiozliIVvjfHkPuu5UE_vd17pApNFxwrFaKOypzlWvzYERG5FavoGt2uM0hD57evOMDAO5jKBT5l5y0CqjAlOz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeff Hull", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis April.7 | Crypto Financial Report", "text": "Home / Crypto / Bitcoin Price Analysis April.7 Bitcoin Price Analysis April.7 Jeff Hull Crypto Comments Off on Bitcoin Price Analysis April.7 118 Views Related Articles Crypto Headlines for the Weekend May.26\nSince our previous Bitcoin analysis, BTC had failed to break the $7,350 strong resistance level and shortly afterwards we’ve seen drop to $7,000 and back to the strong support level at $6,600.\nOverall, the market had not much volume and the last day’s candles are quite small, which tells about reduction in volatility level. So far the $6,600 seems to hold, but it can change quickly. Right now we are testing short-term resistance level at the MA-50 ( moving average 50 days – the purple line in the following chart), it’s more likely to see some correction before breaking it up, but if it does happen then the $7,350 level would be next to be tested again. Besides there is the $7,800 – 8,000 zone.\nFrom the bear side – breaking down the important $6,600 level and we will likely see Bitcoin testing the the low of Feb.6 at $5,900 – $6,000.

Over the past 48 hours, its leading lights have been more preoccupied with having their profile pics “bogged” than posting charts. The Bogdanoff twins are one of the many memes to have taken over the crypto community, providing welcome relief amidst the growing gloom. When the Market Dies, the Memes Flourish Pepe Satoshi\nIt would be easy to write memes off as the frivolous, ephemera that they are. And it’s true that most crypto memes are so esoteric and asinine as to defy explanation. How to account for the phenomenon that is “bog posting” for example, a bizarre tribute to France’s plastic surgery twins who reputedly have the power to crash the crypto markets with one phone call? Or pink wojak, the permanently distressed trader whose every move goes against him – often thanks to a well-timed call from the bogs themselves?\nFor anyone new to crypto, the meaning behind the memes and shitposting must be an utter mystery. Even those raised in the crypto trenches would struggle to explain why or how such characters came to be synonymous with the constant pain of being at the mercy of bitcoin whales who manipulate the market. All they could tell you, if pressed, is that in times of turmoil, memes make everything better. The world may be burning and the markets dumping, but so long as there are exploitable memes to share, the pain is bearable. Rare Pepes, Pink Wojaks and Telegram Stickers Galore Pepe Andreas.\nIn crypto, as on the web at large, many of the memes originate from the home of dank memetics – 4chan – before permeating mainstream culture. The forum’s /biz/ message board has been pivotal in spawning much of the content that’s come to be synonymous with crypto trading. /Biz/, whose unofficial motto is “Buy high, sell low”, has been particularly prolific when it comes to churning out pink wojaks, with one Twitter account dedicated to sharing the best of the bunch.\nAnd then there’s Pepe the frog, who’s never far away when the subject of 4chan memes is broached. One of the most popular dapps over the past week has been the Peppedapp , a place to “Share, buy and sell the dankest memes on Ethereum”. In the last seven days it has been responsible for thousands of transactions involving hundreds of ether. Many traders have been steering clear of the markets amidst lingering uncertainty, but the Peppedapp Telegram group , home to 1,400 collectors of rare Pepes, has been a hub of activity as traders exchange limited edition cards and speculate how much the McAfee card might be worth by June. The Bogdanoff Telegram sticker pack He Sold? “Bogged” Crypto Cobain\nCrypto was geeky from the outset, and over the years its arcane rituals, celebrations and jargon have become embedded in its culture and as immutable as the genesis block itself. It doesn’t really matter why “Fit Vitalik”, “Carol trying to use the Lightning Network”, or “The Bogs” came to be. All that matters is when your portfolio doesn’t bear looking at and there are no ICOs worth FOMOing into, crypto will remain as relevant and irresistible as ever. It’s not just the best music that’s made in tough times: so are the best memes. Sure, they’re stupid as hell.

Antonopoulos Champions Essential ‘Weirdness’\nSpeaking at the Polish Bitcoin Congress in Warsaw May 12, Antonopoulos, who has been a well-known Bitcoin advocate and educator since 2013, argued that Bitcoin’s “weirdness” and decentralization’s ability to “offend” were key to its success.\n“…The reason Bitcoin is interesting is because it’s not controlled, because it can’t be censored, because it’s open, because a lot of the people involved are very, very weird,” he said.\n[…] If you take all that out, what you’re left with – this Blockchain – is a sterile, unexpressive (sic), uninvented environment; a corporate plaything that has been sanitized of every interesting and left as an empty shell. Blockchain Is ‘Basically A Very Slow Database’\nThe views are commonplace for Antonopoulos, who has sought to reinforce the revolutionary qualities behind Bitcoin and other decentralized networks on countless occasions.\nThe Polish talk’s timing, however, was pertinent, as Consensus caused controversy just four days later after other Bitcoin industry figures criticized its Blockchain bias and lack of technical s ubstance.\nBitcoin developers Jimmy Song and Johnathan Corgan specifically highlighted the event’s perceived shortcomings, arguing Blockchain had become a victim of “cargo cult engineering” and that a lack of education on the part of audience members prevented them from sorting valuable information from “buzzwords.”\n“It’s basically a very slow database,” Antonopoulos continued in comments on Blockchain which Song would later emulate.\nIf someone comes to you and says, ‘Do I need a blockchain for my business?’ Ask them, ‘Do you need something that is open, neutral, borderless, that no one controls and that resists censorship?’ If yes, then you need Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, ZCash – some open public Blockchain… that expresses these capabilities.\nBeyond Bitcoin, Antonopoulos also had cautionary words for banks looking to Ethereum for Blockchain solutions.\n“Right now, the big banks, governments – they’re in love with Ethereum. They love the fact that Ethereum has all of these capabilities that seem much, much less weird than Bitcoin,” he continued.\nBut they don’t realize that all of the weirdness is still there[…]. The whole point of Ethereum is to make unstoppable code, applications you cannot turn off – and the reason they can’t be turned off is because they’re decentralized apps – DApps. Why make a DApp unless you wanted to make a DApp that somebody wants to turn off and you want to continue working?\nWhat do you think about Andreas Antonopoulos’ views on Bitcoin versus Blockchain?

Though the jury is still out on whether ether can leapfrog bitcoin for top spot in the market cap ranking, the protocol has already established itself as the premier building block for the crypto economy. // -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace .\nHundreds of cryptocurrency projects have been launched on the Ethereum blockchain. At last check, Ethereum-based tokens accounted for more than 90% of token capitalization.\nAmid the hundreds of ICOs launched via ERC-20 or ERC-23, about 50 stand out from the perspective of market capitalization. Among those, six coins have a market cap of $1 billion or greater. That figure that was as high as a dozen during the peak of the crypto bull market.\nBelow is a breakdown of the five largest Ethereum projects by market cap. Despite their success, these currencies can still be had at a fraction of the cost of ether. // -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD. Click here to change your current membership -- // 1. EOS (EOS)\nEOS is currently ranked No. 1 among Ethereum projects with a total market cap of nearly $9.9 billion. The cryptocurrency made significant moves last month and eventually reached the fifth spot on the crypto-market ranking. Though the official explanation was tied to a lucrative airdrop and growing optimism over the upcoming eos.ios platform, suspicion of an elaborate pump-and-dump soon materialized.\nAt its core, EOS provides infrastructure services for the fast-growing and highly-touted decentralized applications market. As deployment of dApps continues to grow, EOS could be poised to reap the benefits.\nEOS trading volumes are averaging more than $1.6 billion daily. Its major markets include Bithumb, Huobi, Bitfinex and OKEx. 2. Tron (TRX)\nThe Tron hype machine, led by founder Justin Sun, has catapulted TRX into a premier cryptocurrency when measured in terms of market cap and overall trade volumes.\nTron’s vision is to develop a blockchain-based content sharing platform to tap into the trillion-dollar digital entertainment industry. Though the project has succeeded in establishing strong partnerships, it has also been accused of plagiarizing content from projects like Filecoin and IPFS.\nJustin Sun’s company was in the spotlight again last month when it announced a $2 billion reward pool for its development program.\nTRX sees average volumes of around $600 million, with the bulk of activity generated on Upbit, Bithumb and Binance. It has a total market cap of roughly $4.7 billion. 3. VeChain (VEN)\nVeChain hasn’t generated the same media storm as an EOS or a Tron but has quietly emerged as a top-20 cryptocurrency with a market cap close to $2 billion. The IOT blockchain is doubling down on technologies such as RFID chips, near-field communication and sensor keys in pursuit of hyper connectivity.\nAlthough IOT has generated a lot of buzzwords in the tech industry, Cisco has described it as the $19 trillion opportunity. The extension of the internet to the real world is occurring at a rapid pace, with the likes of Samsung vowing to embed AI and connectivity in all its appliances by 2020.\nAs for VeChain, it has already developed strong partnerships with the likes of PwC and DNV GL, a global risk management company.\nVEN tokens generate less than $80 million in daily turnover, with LBank and Binance facilitating the vast majority of market orders. 4. Binance Coin (BNB)\nIf we’re measuring the top ERC projects solely by market cap, then Binance Coin is a top-five coin. In terms of trade volume, it ranks all the way down in eleventh spot.\nAs the name implies, Binance Coin is the crypto asset issued by the Binance exchange, which is the world’s largest by total trade volume. Launched with a strict limit of 200 million tokens, BNB allows users to pay for trading, exchange and listing fees on the Binance exchange.\nBinance recently burned roughly $30 million worth of BNB tokens. Under its repurchase plan, a maximum of 50% of BNB tokens will be burned throughout the coin’s life cycle, leaving only 100 million in circulation.\nThis article is certainly no plug for Binance, but the exchange’s rapid growth over the past eight months is reflected in the performance of its native currency. BNB was launched last July via initial coin offering. Today, it averages more than $66 million in daily turnover. 5. OmiseGo (OMG)\nOmiseGo may not have the same name recognition as the top altcoins, but its fundamentals are among the strongest in the market. The company has made significant inroads in Southeast Asia, including signing a Memorandum of Understanding with a major South Korean credit card company.\nThese developments are key in light of OmiseGo’s stated objective, which is to boost financial inclusion and interoperability through the blockchain. In other words, it seeks to provide better financial services for people in developing countries who lack traditional banking infrastructure.\nAs far as the author is aware, OmiseGo is the only crypto asset outside of Ethereum that is backed by Vitalik Buterin. The Ethereum founder serves on the OMG advisory board.\nThe OMG token is capitalized at roughly $1.1 billion with daily turnover of $45 million. The cryptocurrency is available on several leading exchanges, including Binance, Huobi and OKEx.\nDisclaimer: The author owns bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.
