Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

Dorsey spoke at two events in March and May , where he predicted that Bitcoin would become the international currency of choice by 2028.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak explained.\nWozniak reiterated that he is “not an investor,” having originally purchased Bitcoin at $700 to experiment with its use as a means of payment. “I have one Bitcoin and two ether ,” he told CNBC. Nonetheless, for Wozniak, Bitcoin represents a separate class of crypto asset to all others:\n“Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.”\nAs prices of both Bitcoin and major altcoins remain suppressed in June, Bitcoin having lost around 20% last month, some sources claim that current conditions present a good opportunity for buyers.

New Weekly Show with @rogerkver and @corbinfraser is up on our YouTube Channel.\nWatch it here—> https://t.co/CUoeiS1PRr\n— Bitcoin News (@JennieShafe) June 2, 2018\nIn the interview posted above, Ver announces that BCH will be hitting ‘tens of thousands of convenience stores’ within crypto-friendly Japan.\nHe says:\n“I didn’t post it or talk about it publically yet but we just had a meeting over this week; Bitcoin Cash is coming to tens of thousands of convenient stores in Japan, and you’ll be able to buy anything in the entire convenient store with Bitcoin Cash which means including like paying your electric bill.”\nHe’s right, most of his announcements come by way of his Twitter profile that holds over 500K followers, but he has yet to tweet about the major announcement with Bitcoin Cash.\nThe interview then goes into explaining what the original Bitcoin was intended to accomplish and where Bitcoin Cash thinks they can fill the void instead. The ‘hard-fork’ of the original Bitcoin offers larger “blocks” increasing the number of transactions that can be done per second.\nBitcoin has not switched from being used to for payments, due to its high transaction fees, to becoming more of a ‘store value.’\n>> Ver Trying to Manipulate BCH Price\nNot So Fast Mr. Ver\nIt seems the BCH enthusiasts isn’t loved by all and there seem to be discrepancies behind his latest statements. One twitter use responded to his latest tweet by saying: Wait, i thought it wasn’t supposed to be used as a store of value! Keep moving the goal posts rog as all your lies keep getting exposed 🤣\n— LESTER ⚡️LONG (@cadillackiller) June 2, 2018\nAnother chirped in by saying: Do you ever get tired of sounding like a cheesy commercial?\n— Mike Skuthan ⚡ (@skuthan) June 2, 2018\nWhile these new stores in Japan have yet to be formally announced, it raises some major red flags his former statements are now contradicting one another. Can he be trusted? We will see when the list of these ‘convenience stores’ finally surfaces.

There is a key ascending channel formed with support at $1,170 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term before it makes another upside move towards $1,220.\nBitcoin cash price is trading nicely above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD remains in an uptrend and it could eye an upside break above $1,200 in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThe past few sessions were pretty bullish as bitcoin cash price started an upside ride from the $1,040 swing low against the US Dollar. The price surged higher and broke many hurdles on the way up, including $1,100. It even managed to clear the $1,180 resistance and spiked above the $1,200 level. A high was formed at $1,209 before the price started a downside correction.\nAn initial support is around the 23.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,075 low to $1,209 high. There is also a key ascending channel formed with support at $1,170 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair remains in an uptrend as long as the price $1,100 pivot level is intact. Below the channel support, the next support is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,075 low to $1,209 high at $1,142. However, any major correction from the current levels is less likely, especially below $1,140.\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a nice uptrend above $1,100.

Speaking to CNBC, Wozniak said the mathematical nature and lack of human intervention makes a good case for bitcoin adoption.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak said .\nWozniak’s comments may come as a surprise considering his history with the No. 1 digital currency. In February, the tech guru said he had seven bitcoin stolen by an online scam artist who paid for the coins using a credit card which they canceled soon after the exchange of the bitcoins. At the time, the seven bitcoin were worth $70,000.\nAltcoins head lower; futures bucking the trend Altcoins, or coins other than bitcoin, showed hefty losses in late afternoon New York trading.\nEther ETHUSD, -0.74% is down 4.8% to $591.23, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, -0.43% has lost 7.2% to $1,094.60, Litecoin LTCUSD, +0.18% is off 5.1% at $119.09 and Ripple’s XRP coin XRPUSD, +0.76% is at 65 cents, down 1.7% on the day.\nReflecting the weekend gains, bitcoin futures closed higher Monday. The Cboe June contract XBTM8, +0.17% rose 0.9%, closing at $7,507.50, while the CME June contract BTCM8, +0.33% gained 0.8%, finishing the day at $7,500.\nCryptoWatch: Check bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices, performance and market capitalization—all on one dashboard\nAaron Hankin Aaron Hankin is a MarketWatch reporter in New York who covers cryptocurrency and financial markets.\nWe Want to Hear from You Join the conversation\nComment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "http://twitter.com/@ahhankin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter lusk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch digital", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T15:37:13.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dad0710f8214355a789b05801dc6e0b564d7fee1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS75WDhG7otg30gHI5BUmrWk-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dad0710f8214355a789b05801dc6e0b564d7fee1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS75WDhG7otg30gHI5BUmrWk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

Avi Gilburt Monday June 04, 2018 15:34\nKitco Commentaries | Opinions, Ideas and Markets Talk\nFeaturing views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists.\nCommentaries & Views\nShare this article:\nBubbles in Nasdaq, bubbles in financial assets, bubbles in cryptos . . . bubbles are being reported everywhere. Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash.\nThe problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the “bubble high” it struck in 1929!?\nNow, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its “bubble high” struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their “bubble highs” struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based.\nFor those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago.\nYou see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a “bubble high” years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well.\nWhile many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that crypto’s should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto market’s should be following Ryan Wilday , as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week, and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed.\nWeekly Opportunities In Cryptocurrency: Bottom Held - Can We Go?\nSo, based upon Ryan's analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments.\nAnd, I don’t think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000.\nLast weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets.\nBut, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region.\nAs long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018.

Speaking to CNBC, Wozniak said the mathematical nature and lack of human intervention makes a good case for bitcoin adoption.\n\"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,\" Wozniak said (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html).\nWozniak's comments may come as a surprise considering his history with the No. 1 digital currency. In February, the tech guru said he had seven bitcoin stolen (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/steve-wozniak-had-70000-in-bitcoin-stolen-after-falling-for-a-simple-yet-perfect-scam-2018-02-28) by an online scam artist who paid for the coins using a credit card which they canceled soon after the exchange of the bitcoins.

It will soon accept digital money as payment. The grand plan is to roll out more PUVs like it. A A A Will this thing be the future king of the road? PHOTO BY FRANK SCHUENGEL The subject of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has received growing news coverage in recent times, with the popularity of digital money rising steadily as more and more people understand the workings of it and get onboard with the idea. The Philippines has become a bit of a hotspot for it, too, with a number of local companies trying to push adoption and offering services for anything from buying goods locally to sending international remittances via bitcoin. One area that hasn’t seen much cryptocurrency interest is public transport , but that is about to change. Many Pinoy commuters won't have the slightest clue as to what Bitcoin Cash means. PHOTO BY FRANK SCHUENGEL If you’re hailing a jeepney along the route between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila today, you may see a bright-green PUV stopping next to you and which has the words “ Bitcoin Cash ” emblazoned all over it. It also sports a distinct-looking ‘B’ in place of the usual front grille. The eye-catching people-carrier is the country’s first Bitcoin Jeepney , a project realized by a group of cryptocurrency supporters keen to further push their preferred bitcoin version into the mainstream. We have to admit the color is soothingly cool. PHOTO BY FRANK SCHUENGEL Without getting too technical, it helps to understand that there are a number of different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin itself was released to the world in 2009, and as it is open-source software , in general anyone can work on it and change it in a variety of ways. This is exactly what happened when, in 2017, a group of developers didn’t like the way the original bitcoin was going and decided to create their own version. This so-called hard fork of the bitcoin (or BTC) code resulted in the public ledger that records its transactions, called the blockchain, and the cryptocurrency itself being split in two. The newly created currency was christened Bitcoin Cash, and its supporters have since been busy promoting it. This doesn't stand for Binay, just to be clear. PHOTO BY FRANK SCHUENGEL The jeepney you see here was financed via a crowdfunding model the people behind the project call an “ Initial Jeepney Offering ,” a wordplay on the term ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, which is a popular way to launch new cryptocurrencies. Twenty different individuals donated 0.5 Bitcoin Cash (or BCH for short) in an effort to turn an existing jeepney into their very own digital money marketing mobile. The Twitter handles of these “chairholders,” as they are called, have been emblazoned in the seating area, with the seats themselves displaying the trademark green ‘B’ logo that the BCH community has chosen to adopt. From riding a jeepney to buying a Lamborghini, the real-world uses of cryptocurrencies are many and easy to facilitate The vehicle has been nicknamed Gen, which is short for Genesis Jeepney and hints at the group’s plans to unleash more than just this single PUV onto Metro Manila roads. At the moment, passengers still pay their fares in pesos, but an RFID payment system (think Beep cards ) complete with free Wi-Fi is soon to be installed, meaning that not only has the jeep been paid for with BCH, but passengers will also be able to use the digital cash to ride it in the near future. Once installed, this will be a first in the world and will demonstrate potential large-scale practical uses of cryptocurrencies. This PUV seems to promise a relaxing ride. PHOTO BY FRANK SCHUENGEL No matter which bitcoin version you prefer and support—with there being some quite public squabbles between Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) supporters as to which version is better or more ‘true’—seeing this relatively new technology being pushed into everyday life at breakneck pace is fascinating. This should ultimately change the way we think about and use money. Decentralized digital currencies mean there is no central bank to mess with interest rates, no government control on what you can or cannot do with your money, and no need for expensive bank accounts as your cash is with you at all times. From riding a jeepney to buying a Lamborghini , the real-world uses of cryptocurrencies are many and easy to facilitate. Who would have thought 'jeepney' and 'bitcoin' could be uttered in the same breath? PHOTO BY FRANK SCHUENGEL Currently, Gen runs on diesel, but there are already plans in place to make future cryptocurrency PUVs more environment-friendly. This first vehicle, with its bold look and quirky details like the bitcoin rear lights, is a test bed for the idea. If all goes according to plan, many of us might soon travel on bitcoin-financed jeepneys, with the fare also being handed over in digital cash. The potential for this concept is huge, and you can follow the progress of this project via its Twitter handle @BCHJeepney .

It revealed that a secret court order was allowing the U.S. government to get Verizon to share the phone records of millions of Americans. Later stories, including those in The Washington Post, disclosed other snooping and how U.S. and British spy agencies had accessed information from cables carrying the world’s telephone and internet traffic.\nSnowden’s defenders maintain that the U.S. government has for years exaggerated the damage his disclosures caused. Glenn Greenwald, a former journalist at The Guardian, said there are “thousands upon thousands of documents” that journalists have chosen not to publish because they would harm peoples’ reputation or privacy rights or because it would expose “legitimate surveillance programs.”\n“It’s been almost five years since newspapers around the world began reporting on the Snowden archive and the NSA has offered all kinds of shrill and reckless rhetoric about the ‘damage’ it has caused, but never any evidence of a single case of a life being endangered let alone harmed,” Greenwald said.\nU.S. intelligence officials say they are still counting the cost of his disclosures that went beyond actual intelligence collected to how it was collected. Evanina said intelligence agencies are finishing their seventh classified assessment of the damage.\nJoel Melstad, a spokesman for the counterintelligence center, said five U.S. intelligence agencies contributed to the latest damage assessment, which itself is highly classified. Melstad said damage has been observed or verified in five categories of information the U.S. government keeps classified to protect national security.\nAccording to Melstad, Snowden-disclosed documents have put U.S. personnel or facilities at risk around the world, damaged intelligence collection efforts, exposed tools used to amass intelligence, destabilized U.S. partnerships abroad and exposed U.S. intelligence operations, capabilities and priorities.\n“With each additional disclosure, the damage is compounded — providing more detail to what our adversaries have already learned,” Melstad said.\nSteven Aftergood, a declassification expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said he thinks intelligence agencies are continuing to do Snowden damage assessments because the disclosures’ relevance to foreign targets might take time to recognize and understand. He said the way that intelligence targets adapt based on information revealed and the impact on how the U.S. collects intelligence could continue for years. But he said that any damage that Snowden caused to U.S. intelligence partners abroad would have been felt immediately after the disclosures began in 2013.\nMoscow has resisted U.S. pressure to extradite Snowden, who faces U.S. charges that could land him in prison for up to 30 years. From exile, Snowden often does online public speaking and has been active in developing tools that reporters can use, especially in authoritarian countries, to detect whether they are under surveillance.\nSnowden supporters say that the government is exaggerating when it claims he took more than 1 million documents and that far fewer have actually been disclosed.\n“I think the number of NSA documents that have been published is in the hundreds and not the thousands,” said Snowden’s lawyer, Ben Wizner. He said the government has never produced any public evidence that the released materials have cause “genuine harm” to U.S. national security.\n“The mainstream view among intelligence professionals is that every day and every year that has gone by has lessened the value and importance of the Snowden archives,” Wizner said. “The idea that information that was current in 2013 — and a lot of it was much older than that — might still alert somebody to anything in 2018 seems like a stretch.”\nGreenwald said the journalists were handed some 9,000 to 10,000 secret documents under the condition that they avoid disclosing any information that could harm innocent people, and that they give the NSA a chance to argue against the release of certain classified materials.\n“We’ve honored his request with each document we’ve released,” Greenwald said. “In most cases, we’ve rejected the NSA’s arguments as unsubstantiated, but always gave them the opportunity for input, and will continue to do so.”\nHe said that in 2016, The Intercept announced a program to disclose Snowden documents in bulk and open the collection to journalists and other experts around the world. Greenwald said that since then, hundreds of documents have been disclosed at a time after careful reviews.

It is something that has truly rocked the financial world , forcing governments to try to react to the burgeoning trend.\nFinancial institutions are also wondering how they fit into this brave new world of finance. It can make it seem, to a small business owner, that you almost have to include it in your operations to stay current and in the mix. But you must realize the principles of value fluctuation as it pertains to Bitcoin because that can have a drastic effect, both positive and negative, on the future of your business.\nIncorporating Bitcoin means that you will likely be using it in your small business to both send and receive payments. But those payments, in a way, are malleable, because of how the value of Bitcoin fluctuates far more readily than traditional payment options like cash. That fluctuation makes it an attractive investment product for many wanting to gain quick returns in a short period of time; that’s why trading programs in the manner of Crypto CFD Trader , which allow for investors to simply pay into an account, have artificial intelligence buy and sell the coins, and let the profits mount, are so valuable. But fluctuation is something to be reckoned with by business owners. Here’s why. The Usual\nWhen your business is paid with cash for your products and services, it is usually exactly what it says it is. A dollar is a dollar, a pound is a pound, and so on. The values of currencies are changing all the time, especially when weighed against each other, so it could have a factor is you are doing business internationally should your physical currency of choice inflate or deflate in value. But, for the most part, you can be sure of the amount that you have received and know it’s worth will stay relatively static for a long period of time. The Bitcoin Difference\nGetting paid in Bitcoin is almost like getting paid with a very volatile stock. It might start off at a certain value when you receive it, but be completely different days, even hours, afterward. If the value rises, that’s wonderful for your business; it’s almost like getting paid double. But the value could also drop, meaning that your received payments can diminish to the point that they’re hardly worth anything. For a small business depending on these payments, that can be a hard pill to swallow. The Solution\nThese warnings are not meant to scare small business owners away from Bitcoin. But you can take a measured approach. Perhaps you can buy and hold some for a while to see how the value fluctuates and see if the risk is tolerable to you.

There's no way to inflate the money supply in the second layer, since all transactions are backed by real bitcoins.\"", "text": "I will here present a drawn out scenario taking possibly generations and not one that might be equally possible, but would take unknown factors and happen in a much shorter time. The example is meant to get you thinking about the limitations and potential systematic risks of the network and not to conclude that somehow I have thought of every way in which the system could suffer or that I am Nostradamus making a prediction of absolute and certain disaster. But let's think about the title of this post for a moment.\nSome refer to the Lightning Network trading of bitcoins as in a sense \"trading unforgeable certificates of gold, that can't ever have their redeemability taken away\" . This certainly seems to be the case from a coding and cryptology perspective. It becomes an especially convincing perspective of course, when the remaining Bitcoin Core developers choose to effectively eliminate the essential cash attributes of the still so called \"coin\" that trades under the BTC ticker. But as soon as we take economics and system security into account we notice that it's actually not quite so simple.\nBitcoin alone will always be susceptible to some attacks of course (this is not really possible to avoid with any system) and in a worst case scenario a majority of the community would actually be convinced to abandon the fundamental principles described in the systems design paper for an inferior replacement.\nThis would radically reduce both the actual economy and the perceived utility of the old network, most likely leading to a rapid drop in the global market price for the coins held by those community members still wanting to transact by the old means. Simultaneously, it could still potentially generate a handsome profit for those wanting nothing to do with the old system and hence selling their coins on the global market before the older coin had a chance to grind its way back into recovery.\nAs long as Proof-of-Work is kept , the users of the Lightning Network will always suffer the same risk in this regard as the users trading bitcoins directly on the Bitcoin Network. If they switch to a non-PoW model, they will immediately face other issues. But they will also have to deal with any other potential risks introduced by the system design of the Lightning Network itself .\nIt is true that all coins or \"certificates\" on the Lightning Network piggy back of the Bitcoin Networks security provided by hashing nodes and are economically speaking also \"backed\" by real bitcoins. The only reason taking away the peg in fact at some point in fact might work , is that the LN transactions are not themselves * actual Bitcoin transactions in the process of being settled on the chain. They are not 0-conf transactions held in the many mempools of nodes on the Bitcoin Network, subject to the \"first seen\" rule or and currently waiting to be timestamped by inclusion in block. As soon as they are, this is less of a problem.\nBut the plan with regard to the Lightning Network is to popularize these \"second layer\" transactions as regular transactions in order to reduce the total number of transactions made on the Bitcoin blockchain and reduce the recourse requirements of running nodes, potentially letting them happen very rarely, take a very long time or even to actually have users never perceive a need to settle them.\nConsidering the practical topology of how the more high profile \"nodes\", \"hubs\" or \"more popular users\" with greater than average connectivity and liquidity in the otherwise generally \"decentralized\" network have so far, and indeed must be expected to organically accumulate -- by merit of those choosing the routes and connections they themselves perceive to be the best, given their particular taste in all of the other individual users or businesses on the LN network and the relative liquidity that they provide for making a particular sought after transaction --, we can conclude that they have per these traits a greater economic influence then the rest that have chosen to depend on their reliability. We are not here concerned with making any sort of typical ethical condemnation of size or of having money, so we would not be interested in this if it weren't for the fact that introduces the same local potential failure points that are the key to centralization. The economy will therefore be susceptible to many of the same pitfalls as the old old economy that had preceded Bitcoin as it had been properly known per Satoshis design in the first place.\nBecause of the users flocking to the previous mentioned \"hubs\" that provide greater liquidity, lower fees or help connect them better to the rest of the network, the precise routing of the system becomes a source of constraint. Users can no longer connect to just any node in the network and there is no way other than preferring the already largest hubs to as objectively as possible judge the incentives and the reliability of the nodes involved. Such measurement also never gives any guarantee whatsoever that the node you prefer and depend on will always remain available all the minutes of the day, every day, -- nor could the operator ever guarantee such a thing -- how likely it is to disappear in the event of financial turmoil or what happens if a government takes action against the operator for any number of reasons that need not have anything to do with the individual operator himself or his company in question.\nBecause of this remaining element of risk , a certain need for trust spreads throughout the system. An algorithm that instead determines the route used by the individual user in a very careful way, can make a trade-off between such risk and benefit, which would help mitigate some of the risk and maximize benefit per a certain formula. But the fundamental problem doesn't change or disappear.\nBecause of their importance in the ecosystem, hubs can now use it as leverage in upcoming board meetings about how Bitcoin should grow as a payment-/settlement system and what changes or other perceived improvements are necessary to make. Their combined influence, if they are many and diverse, may be significantly mitigated and will especially meet initial resistance from node operators (solo-miners and pools) in the Bitcoin Network itself on key topics. But as long as the miners are happy , the Lightning Network or any other second layer can operate as they wish . This can be the case with or without the changed incentives that some specific code changes along the way might bring. There is also no guarantee that there will not be significant overlap between these two groups over time.\nAs we have seen throughout history , gold backed currencies rarely survive for long before a central entity controls and manipulates them. Not even gold trade itself is entirely without its scammers and where no alternative is allowed, manipulation still takes place from the top. It would be easy for the greater beneficiaries of the Lightning Network to honestly but mistakenly conclude that it is the best possible system and that making transactions on the Bitcoin Network is actually unnecessary for anyone but the miners. Striking a deal with the miners, that let miners keep their transaction fees or even increase them by making transactions possible on a less regular basis, they can safeguard the survival of their own system, increase their own influence and more aggressively at this point push almost any agenda that they'd like as long as miners do not interfere.\nUsers that dissent with the policies of the Lightning Network can't merely take their money out of the system. They will have to trust that settlement is still possible or that a greater fool, that's so far using a different cryptocurrency, willingly takes their place.\nIf transactions on the Bitcoin network are still somewhat reliable, economic activity can happen there instead of the Lightning Network. But it will only do so if there are actually bitcoins left un-pegged and held by enough users that are doing business on it.\nIn our case The Lightning Network itself might already have become considered the primary space where exchange of bitcoin and as such \"bitcoin transactions\" takes place -- even though what trade hands are actually the certificates -- making certificates the default means of exchange within the community economy. Interest in regular Bitcoin transactions might be low due to impracticality alone or also ignorance and standing alone is not so easy.\nAs long as there then is still some monetary value to the \"bitcoin backed\" notes being produced by the Lightning Network, it is not a long shot that those disagreeing will largely have left and that economic policy can be more fundamentally change through political persuasion , not to mention propaganda. It would not matter much if the devalued \"bitcoins\" were produced as real bitcoins would by the miners, whom would have the power to lift the 21 million limit, or in the form of fractional reserve fiat by the Lightning Network itself. The currency could be equally distributed throughout the entire network, but in either case the bulk of the money would be most likely to end up with the hubs themselves, who could then mercifully distribute it \"fairly\" to the rest of the ecosystem.\nMiners would eventually want their share of course, but no other party would have any practical way of stopping inflation and even if the miners decided to reduce congestion it is not clear that it would be possible for neither them or users to resurrect the network without great struggles.\nIt would of course not ever be entirely unfeasible to see an economic exodus through open source means similar to how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used today, early on or much later, such as through establishing a copy of the blockchain. But even if this happens, the event here described would, again, already have significantly damaged the economy and the market value of the new competing currency will initially be nowhere near the currency by this time widely known by the Lightning Network participants as \"bitcoins\".\n-If you are trading cryptocurrency to make a short term profit, none of this might interest you. But if you truly are in this for the long run and have other motivations, such as saving, spending on both essential and/or non-essential items and more than anything if you want to support the bootstrapping of a revolutionary new technology that could bring liberty and great wealth to millions , then you should care about a systems design, a currency's long term viability and therefore also its potential pitfalls.\n submitted by /u/fruitsofknowledge\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T21:55:52.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd2daf5998365f099089a97a2618446c660b1a88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXkMIKtJXyQEWR8H92r_Wlw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why bitcoin transaction fee keeps increasing?", "title_full": "Why bitcoin transaction fee keeps increasing?", "published": "2018-06-04T02:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.109, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd2daf5998365f099089a97a2618446c660b1a88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXkMIKtJXyQEWR8H92r_Wlw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "semarm3sem", "published": "2018-06-04T02:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why bitcoin transaction fee keeps increasing?", "text": "Fees will continue to increase.\nFor a \"fee market\" to evolve, there needs to be demand and suppliers.

Brandt Watches For Sunday ‘Buy’ Chart Data from across major exchanges showed BTC/USD move through $7,700. As of press time on Sunday, it is hovering between $7,720 and $7900. Bitcoin’s newfound support upends a weekly downturn, which saw prices bottom out at $7,096 on May 29. A strong support at $6,900 remains untested since early April. Sources from within the cryptocurrency industry remain hawkish on the potential for a more decisive return to form for Bitcoin — which has so far failed to regain ground lost through May, where it hit a peak of $9,922 . When analyzing charts over the weekend, veteran trader Peter Brandt suggested BTC/USD “could” produce a ‘buy’ signal by Monday — while tapering enthusiasm about the pair sustaining further support. A chart buy signal could (I said \"could,\" not \"would\") occur in $BTCUSD over the weekend. Stay tuned pic.twitter.com/GlVCtKabhb — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 1, 2018 Pantera Capital Weighs In On Institutional Investor ‘Pile-In’ Earlier in the week, more confident cues came from Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, who once again repeated calls to buy Bitcoin . “All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now,” he told CNBC on May 31. “It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.” Morehead’s statements were made in consideration of 2018’s wider narrative on Bitcoin prices , which has seen traders weigh the possibility of institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency market en masse — which would almost assuredly boost prices significantly. Rather than a sudden influx as some foresee, Morehead acknowledged that any further engagement would instead be a “process.” He stated: There’s an image out there where there’s an ‘on-off switch’ and it’s off now and they’re going to flick it on on some particular date and institutions will pile in. […] It’s a process. Obviously, risk and reward go together; a couple of years ago there was a lot of risk but there was a lot of reward, and we’ve yet to get to the point where we have an SEC-regulated custodian which is the one silver bullet everyone’s waiting for — but many institutions are buying the rumor and selling the fact.” What do you think about Bitcoin’s price action this weekend?

A triple-tier service provides varying levels of privacy, all geared around outsmarting the blockchain forensic tools deployed by companies such as Chainalysis. Also read: Bitcoin’s Chance at the $20 Trillion Offshore Tax Haven Market Bestmixer Ups Its Privacy Game Bitcoin tumbler services and blockchain analysis firms have been engaged in a cat and mouse game, with each trying to outwit the other. Blockchain forensics companies have the full weight of law enforcement behind them and the deep pockets of government funding their bitcoin deanonymizing efforts. Tumbler services, in comparison, have little more than some open source code and a desire to reclaim the privacy that’s been gradually eroded from the web over the years, with crypto users among the worst affected. Bestmixer.io launched in March of this year, and has just issued a major update to its privacy features. Users of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC can feed their coins through the service, with the ones that emerge on the other side promised to be untainted and unlinkable. Platforms such as Chipmixer offer a similar service, which can be accessed from the clearnet or deep web, providing a means of obfuscating activity on darknet markets and anywhere else where privacy is desired. Beating Chainalysis at Their Own Game In a post on the Bitcointalk forum , the Bestmixer team announced the introduction of a new module containing reserves for mixing, writing: Not so long ago a New York blockchain startup ‘Chainalysis’ announced the launch of a real-time transaction analysis tool. A new tool called ‘Chainalysis KYT’ (Know Your Transaction) allows real-time transaction analysis. In particular, the new functionality allows cryptocurrency companies to find out instantly how reliable their counterparty is, and whether it operates with funds that were previously used in illegal financial transactions. In connection with this news, we decided to divide our reserves into three pools, each of which will fulfill its goals. The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma pools offer different degrees of privacy, with the latter two commanding an increased fee commensurate with the cost of maintaining them. Explaining the importance of privacy for all cryptocurrency users, the Bestmixer team said: “Everyone who has ever participated in a transaction with you has an opportunity to find out the addresses of your wallets, their balances, and can determine the origin of your coins and the destination address. Apart from disclosing the details of your private life, it also makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.” Chainalysis have become unavoidable in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to KYC and KYT. Many ideologues regard them as “enemies of bitcoin” due to their efforts to deliver cryptocurrency users into the hands of the state that bitcoin was arguably designed to counter. In addition to being used in criminal investigations, Chainalysis is deployed to detect pooling with ICO private sales, something that most ICOs are publicly against but which is rampant. Services such Bestmixer and Chipmixer play a small but vital role in protecting the privacy of those who cherish it the most.

And why not! Hardware wallets are more superior in terms of security of your bitcoins and also more user-friendly than paper wallets. Read: How To Make A Bitcoin Paper Wallet & How To Spend Bitcoins For the uninitiated, hardware wallets are hardware devices that look similar to a flash drive and are used to store your bitcoins, whereas a paper wallet is a piece of paper with a pair of public and private keys printed on it. Paper wallets were more popular in the early crypto days as there were no hardware wallets. But now with a plethora of options in hardware wallets, it is stupid to risk your coins on a paper. (We like Ledger Nano S wallet the most as it has everything one may need!!) Many investors have now started to understand this point now and want to migrate from paper wallets to hardware wallets like the Nano S. But the problem is, they get stuck when they try to migrate because there is no direct way to do so. Confused? Let me explain. There is no direct way to transfer your bitcoins from a paper wallet to ledger wallet and that’s why many face difficulty. But there is an indirect way by which you can do the same and that’s what I am here to share with you today. Sending BTC From Paper Wallet To Ledger Wallet Note: One cannot send BTC directly from a paper wallet to Ledger as of now. For this, you need to use a third intermediate software/mobile wallet and then send your BTC to Ledger. (In the future you can expect an inbuilt functionality in Ledger Nano S to do so directly). Step #1. Install a mobile wallet on your mobile if you don’t have it. I installed the Coinomi wallet on my Android smartphone for this tutorial. Step #2. Create a new wallet with Conomi. Note: Keep your seed words very safe while setting-up your new wallet for the first time. Step #3. Now go to ‘Bitcoin’ wallet in Coinomi’s interface, which will look like: Step #4. After clicking on ‘Bitcoin’, you will see this screen. Step #5. Now click on the three dots as shown in the image above to see the screen below. Step #6. Click on the ‘Sweep wallet’ option as shown in the above image to see this: Step #7. Now select ‘Bitcoin’ in ‘Receive with’ dropdown and scan the private keys from your paper wallet. Note: Coinomi supports only WIF, BIP38, & mini private key formats. Step #8. Once this is done and your coins are imported (swept), they will be reflected in your Coinomi wallet. Remember: It is always advised to sweep your paper wallet into a software wallet instead of importing it. Here are the detailed reasons why to do so: Highlighting The Difference Between Sweeping & Importing Private Keys . Now your coins are in Coinomi and you need to transfer them to Ledger Nano S. For this, you need to get hold of Ledger Nano’s valid Bitcoin address on which you want to receive your bitcoins. For this, follow the steps below: Step #9. Launch the Bitcoin Ledger Wallet application on your device. Step #10. Plug in the Ledger Nano S to your device (PC/mobile) and unlock it using your PIN code. Remember: Don’t share this PIN with anyone because using this PIN, anyone can get into your Ledger Nano S if they have access to the device. Step #11. Once your Ledger device is connected, open your Bitcoin application on the device. You will be prompted to select Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash. Select ‘ Bitcoin ’. Step #12. After you have selected ‘Bitcoin’, the app will prompt you to select ‘Legacy’ or ‘Segwit’ types of addresses. In this case, you need to select ‘Legacy’ if you want your BTC on ‘Legacy’ addresses that start with digit ‘1’ or ‘Segwit’ if you want your BTC on ‘Segwit’ addresses that start with ‘3’. In this case, I am selecting segwit because using segwit has many benefits that you can read here . Also, to avail these benefits you should migrate to segwit with help of this step by step guide . Step #13. Click on ‘Segwit’. The sync should take a few seconds to take you to the Segwit blockchain. Step #14. After the sync, you will be able to see this screen on your wallet. Here you will see your accounts, balance, send, receive and settings options. Step #15. Click ‘Receive’ as shown in the image above to see this screen where a pop-up will prompt you to select your ‘Account To Credit’. If you use Ledger Nano S for the first time it will show you only one account. Step #16. Now click on ‘Display Address On Device’ option as shown above. If you look closely, there is a note that says: only receive funds on this address if it matches the one displayed on your device. For this, please verify if the address shown in your Ledger app and the address shown on your actual hardware device is same. Once both are verified and matched you are good to go ahead. Step #17. Once addresses are matched, it means the address shown is safe to receive BTC. Step #18. Now you can scan the QR code in step #16 from your Coinomi mobile wallet or copy-paste the address shown in the ledger app where you want to receive your bitcoins. Step # 11. Now you need to enter the relevant details in the below-shown interface of the Coinomi wallet. Once you have put the details and just hit send from your wallet and wait for the transaction to reflect on Blockchain explorer . Conclusion: Transferring Bitcoin from a Paper wallet Always remember that you should wait for six confirmations on the blockchain to consider a transaction successful. And lastly, if you haven’t started using Ledger Nano S then you should use it as it has many useful features that can make management of multiple cryptocurrencies hassle free. Always buy Ledger Nano S from the official website and thoroughly learn how to set up and use Ledger Nano S through our exclusive video tutorial series on the same.

The country now has 46 bitcoin ATMs with 10 just being deployed in the Prague subway system. It’s probably good news then that the price of bitcoin has seemed to find a relatively stable triangle on its price volatility to encourage more real world use. But it seems that some speculators are starting to suffer from addiction to that volatility. Scotland's largest addiction treatment facility has developed a treatment program for those investors who have maybe gone too far with their enthusiasm and just can’t stop. Can conventional stock markets take advantage of the concepts of Atomic Swaps that we are seeing developed in the cryptocurrency space? It’s all part of the growing trend towards decentralization of everything and removing as many middlemen as possible.

Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs Located in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. Scotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts Castle Craig Hospital — Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that “cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency” and that “this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.” The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer “yes” to 5 or more, they likely fall into the “addict” category. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move After days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile. There is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside. Op Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading In traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars. Atomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled. These “all or nothing” trades preserve atomicity because they either take place or are canceled immediately. Advancing Toward a Decentralized Internet in the Real World The recently aired Season 5 of the popular HBO comedy Silicon Valley features a decentralized internet powered by end-user devices and an internal blockchain-based crypto economy. As usual, the fictional treatment in the show, which has been rightly praised for providing an entertaining but accurate portrait of contemporary tech trends, is based on real developments.

I really noticed this with a game that not only has collectible \"cards\" of different rarity, but different power levels for those cards. So the skill level isn't limited to gameplay, but also amount of time/money invested in the game. This means the pieces which are used are not under the direct control of the participants, so if we wanted to play a certain way (e.g. with everything at the same power level), we couldn't.\nI think that a public blockchain with a memo/blockpress-style communication could be a good alternative for a game lobby system. You could signal your intent to start or join a game (or one of its variants) with a public key-based identity along with enough information to let participants connect/watch. Challengers could accept, and game moves/summaries/outcomes could published on the blockchain, too. Bitcoin Cash would be a good candidate. :)\nIf you think of a game as a set of initial conditions and a series of validated transformations at the direction of participants (with some mechanism for randomness when appropriate), the game itself and how the players interact with it become two different applications. One neat thing about this is that game development could be split up into two different pieces: client/user-interface and rules/server. As long as you have a game and a complete specification of rules/protocols, gameplay could occur on-chain or off-chain (but still have moves be signed/authenticated by participants). Additionally, which clients people use become irrelevant to the game/blockchain itself as long as they validate according to the same sets of rules.\nThere are a lot of details to work out and conventions/protocols would be very important, but I think it's all doable. I think tic-tac-toe would be a good starting example.

Crypto groups and tourists from Japan have been invited to the launch in the town of 1800 inhabitants. The project plans to attract international tourists to pay for goods in Bitcoin, which can immediately be converted into Australian dollars.\nLocal real estate agent Gordon Christian said he won local businesses’ support to bring the technology to the town to boost its main industry, tourism, and also to attract an “alternative” type of traveler.\nBitcoin in Australia currently stands 18 th on the Bitcoin Volume by Currency index and cryptocurrencies are not yet regarded as legal tender, so the town has taken to the challenge of elevating the profile of digital currency use. Such enterprises are growing in the country from state to state as retailers, restaurant’s and café’s come onboard in ever-increasing numbers.\nTravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh said it was early days for the currency, and that there was strong support for it as a “social movement”. The company currently supports many new crypto enterprises in the hospitality industry including the new crypto project with Queensland’s International Airport retailers, which is off to a slow start with just a handful of transactions in the airport each day so far, worth between $5 and $55.\n“If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers,” he said, adding “Travelling with one global currency like Bitcoin … makes sense.”\nGordon Christian said that he was motivated towards the town’s new project by the recent announcement that Brisbane airport had taken the title of “a crypto friendly airport,” and also being asked by a customer if he accepted Bitcoin. The estate agent also added that another advantage was that blockchain technology could protect merchants from the costs of credit card fraud.\nHe pointed out that the project was slow to start, but soon gained momentum:\n“Initially we had a good 10 businesses that just said, ‘Fine — let’s go for it…then the idea spread across the town’s tourism industry with the “digital traveler” in mind.”\nThirty-one businesses in the town have now signed up, from resorts and backpackers to tour companies, restaurants, the local pub and a day spa.\nChristian is clearly positive with the outcome, suggesting “It’s a whole new world”\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Australia on Trend With Its First Crypto Friendly Town, Complete With Bitcoin Billboard appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

In an industry where bitcoin has taken a backseat to networks like ethereum, at least when it comes to enabling more complex and exotic transactions, both founders behind the peer-to-peer exchange platform Hodl Hodl believe people are underestimating bitcoin’s potential.\nUnlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value. The exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchain by using what’s known as a multi-signature smart contract.\nHodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.\nThose contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller’s keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company’s server or database.\nBecause of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said: “Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.” This paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.

This is meme kinda true. But there is a huge range of applications out there where we dont NEED blockchain, but it would still be really cool!\nI would love to have my vehicle ownership represented by a colored coin. I could use a trezor like device to start it up and no one would ever be cracking that security. I could transfer ownership via blockchain and it would be amazingly smooth and so much easier and nicer than a traditional title transfer. I could allow someone limited access to it like if my buddy wanted to borrow my car on Tuesday I could just temporarily authorize his digital signature with my digital signature and I could do it remotely.\nYes and in a perfect world, this is how it should work. You should have the power to transfer title of ownership of something you own directly to another party without a third party in the middle. But that's the problem. When state-run Bureaus of Motor Vehicles have centralized control of title issuance, transfer, and registration of motor vehicles, and of course make revenue off of that activity, then why would they ever relinquish that power back to the individual? They would make so many excuses has to why that activity should be state-run and not decentralized.\nAlso, I wouldn't doubt that state-run BMV's will eventually try to implement some sort of blockchain solution behind the scenes as a 'calling card' to say that they are trying to change and do something.

The country now has 46 bitcoin ATMs with 10 just being deployed in the Prague subway system. It’s probably good news then that the price of bitcoin has seemed to find a relatively stable triangle on its price volatility to encourage more real world use. But it seems that some speculators are starting to suffer from addiction to that volatility. Scotland's largest addiction treatment facility has developed a treatment program for those investors who have maybe gone too far with their enthusiasm and just can’t stop.\nCan conventional stock markets take advantage of the concepts of Atomic Swaps that we are seeing developed in the cryptocurrency space? It’s all part of the growing trend towards decentralization of everything and removing as many middlemen as possible.\nFeatured stories by Jimmy Aki, Erik Kuebler, Giulio Prisco, Nick Marinoff and Bitcoin Schmitcoin\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here .\nCrypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs Located in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go.\nScotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts Castle Craig Hospital — Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that “cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency” and that “this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.” The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer “yes” to 5 or more, they likely fall into the “addict” category.\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move After days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nOp Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading In traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars.\nAtomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled. These “all or nothing” trades preserve atomicity because they either take place or are canceled immediately.\nAdvancing Toward a Decentralized Internet in the Real World", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/scotland-hospital-opens-rehab-center-crypto-trading-addicts/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/advancing-toward-decentralized-internet-real-world/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/crypto-go-prague-subway-gets-10-new-bitcoin-atms/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-consolidation-leans-toward-strong-bitcoin-move/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/crypto-go-prague-subway-gets-10-new-bitcoin-atms/&quot;", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hospital-launches-rehab-clinic-to-treat-cryptocurrency-addiction-2018-05-29&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/scotland-hospital-opens-rehab-center-crypto-trading-addicts/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-atomic-swaps-could-work-stock-market-trading/", "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-addiction-rehab-cryptocurrency-trading-castle-craig-hospital-a8373801.html", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UtsIhie0aPts27dQdDrpUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f);", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-atomic-swaps-could-work-stock-market-trading/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-consolidation-leans-toward-strong-bitcoin-move/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/advancing-toward-decentralized-internet-real-world/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UtsIhie0aPts27dQdDrpUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hospital-launches-rehab-clinic-to-treat-cryptocurrency-addiction-2018-05-29", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)", "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-addiction-rehab-cryptocurrency-trading-castle-craig-hospital-a8373801.html&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik kuebler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giulio prisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy aki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick marinoff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague subway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T20:19:40.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "824abfedc74d3dadd300a5c63ffa4d2526e71027", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmetzRC9yPDbWg4ArZ6idetQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=251.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Ivory Tower", "title": "No Bitcoin has ever been mined.", "title_full": "No Bitcoin has ever been mined.", "published": "2018-06-03T23:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "824abfedc74d3dadd300a5c63ffa4d2526e71027", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmetzRC9yPDbWg4ArZ6idetQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "YuTü.Co.in", "published": "2018-06-03T23:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "No Bitcoin has ever been mined.", "text": "Quote: from: Jet Cash on June 03, 2018, 08:28:58 AM Quote: from: botany on June 01, 2018, 04:18:18 PM\nThe closest would be discovering an old wallet that you used for faucets in 2010.\nBut not everybody can do such a thing.\nI gave you a couple of merits for that comment.
