Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency has now overtaken Bitcoin (BTC) based on the number of unique addresses. Ethereum has for the first time surpassed Bitcoin in the number of active addresses.Keeping in mind that ETH wallets re-use addresses while BTC wallets do not, normally there should be fewer active ETH addresses/unit. However, the fact that numbers are showing that ETH has almost 100k more active addresses than BTC, we can conclude that there is more crypto activity around Ethereum. Despite the fact that the leader of the cryptocurrency rank by market capitalization is around for a very long time, the clear winner when it comes to finding use in the place is Ethereum.For Bitcoin, there is room left only for 100k more transactions, but Ethereum’s reach is at 600k for what it is now, which number can go at 1 mil with a couple of improvements that have taken place lately. Alexis Ohanian is pointing towards Ethereum for those that want to be part of the winner zone while recommending to look past Bitcoin [BTC] which is leading the crypto-list by market capitalization. The main reason that Ohanian is favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin is the flexible-environment for application development that the former one delivers against the blockchain platform of the latter one.

Despite the issue being reportedly resolved, the incident serves to highlight the need for decentralized, stable alternatives where possibilities of the kind are simply non-existent.\nIn an official statement on Twitter, Visa announced that their payment processing service is experiencing a “service disruption”: We are currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. We are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. We will keep you updated.\nReportedly , Visa users were experiencing serious issues with their card payments. They were receiving messages stating that there was a “disruption of service,” preventing providers receiving or sending money. Major Red Flag\nCredit card payments weren’t the only service impacted by the Visa outage. The issue also prevented many European customers from transacting with cash deposited in their bank accounts. The Irish Times reported that Irish tourists as far away as the US were unable to access their money.\nPersonal hassles aside, the outage could have triggered major issues for banking institutions as well. Reports began emerging of people lining up in front of ATMs to withdraw as much cash as possible for fear of a prolonged outage.\nBanks like HSBC started tweeting about the problem almost immediately: We are aware of an industry wide issue affecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and MasterCard transactions are not impacted. Visa are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will continue to support our impacted customers as needed.\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Current Problem Resolved, Underlying Issues Remain\nEarlier today, almost 20 hours after Visa first acknowledged the outage, the company posted an announcement on their website, claiming that the issue had been resolved:\nVisa Europe’s payment system is now operating at full capacity, and Visa account holders can now use Visa for any of their purchases and at ATMs, as they normally would.\nYet, a certain point needs to be stressed. Visa is one of the leading payment solutions providers, with millions of people using its services around the world. While it’s unclear how many of those customers were affected by the problem, one thing is clear – a problem with a single, centralized service provider can potentially leave millions of people unbanked. Can Crypto Provide an Answer?\nIn the official announcement, Visa explained that the outage was caused by some sort of “system failure.” The question here is – can we afford to let a “system” and its support team determine whether millions of people across the world will have access to their money?\nThe problem is much larger than Visa, of course, but this particular incident clearly outlines the need for an alternative – like Bitcoin – that is immune to such “system failures.”\nDecentralization could well solve all of these problems and, ironically, Visa is no stranger to the technology. In October 2016, Visa announced that it was working on a blockchain-based solution for cross-border, business-to-business exchange. Similarly, just this past month, MasterCard filed a patent for faster node verification system.\nCould all of this be hinting that we are closer to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology?\nAmid all of the chaos caused by Visa’s outage, one simple truth emerged: Visa network goes down today.\nBitcoin has never gone down.

Bitcoin (BTC) Passed by 35mil Ethereum Unique Addresses - Cryptocurrency News - Bitcoin News", "text": "0 9\nIs the flippening upon us? Ethereum (ETH) advocates are citing block explorer Etherscan claim to passed 35 million unique addresses, a doubling in something like five months, averaging reportedly 100K a day. The last available figures for bitcoin core (BTC) addresses had them at roughly 25 million as of spring this year. ETH enthusiasts are insisting this is a positive step in the march to eventually snatch the number one coin by market capitalization spot.\nAlso read: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount Flippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype?\nHopeful hype is starting again in pockets of the crypto ecosystem, especially among Vitalik Buterin fans and ETH followers. It’s due to their long held belief the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization must eventually replace bitcoin core (BTC) at the top in what’s been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the best word at the moment, if only because of that pesky market capitalization: as of publication , BTC has nearly three times the market cap of ETH, and 24 trading volume seems to follow a similar ratio.\nWhat is causing a restirring of such flippening just might be a relatively recent milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining something in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers’ celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million. Still, the leap passed BTC also includes active addresses , perhaps a more profound metric when attempting to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500K, BTC about 25K less. BTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame\nAddresses do not equate to actual users, however. One ETH user can hold many addresses, and in the case of ETH smart contracts are also being smuggled in the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos can be telling when placed against the above stats. Ethereum wallet address are reused as a matter of course, while bitcoin core wallet address are frequently particular to each transaction. By every rational theory, BTC should far outstrip ETH in at least this category. As explained, that’s not the case. Caveats include how the 100K per day number is actually quite a fall off from as soon as the beginning of this year when ETH was clocking 300K per day at times. The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction fees and times, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC at the height of its price and corresponding media coverage only compounded block size issues. Should the flippening happen, the BTC community would have itself to blame.\nDo you think anything like the flippening is happening?

Bitcoin (BTC) Passed by 35mil Ethereum Unique Addresses Willi Reede | June 2, 2018 | Flippening? Bitcoin (BTC) Passed by 35mil Ethereum Unique Addresses Dont Risk Your Bitcoin Security!\nIs the flippening upon us? Ethereum (ETH) advocates are citing block explorer Etherscan claim to passed 35 million unique addresses, a doubling in something like five months, averaging reportedly 100K a day. The last available figures for bitcoin core (BTC) addresses had them at roughly 25 million as of spring this year. ETH enthusiasts are insisting this is a positive step in the march to eventually snatch the number one coin by market capitalization spot.\nAlso read: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount Flippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype?\nHopeful hype is starting again in pockets of the crypto ecosystem, especially among Vitalik Buterin fans and ETH followers. It’s due to their long held belief the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization must eventually replace bitcoin core (BTC) at the top in what’s been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the best word at the moment, if only because of that pesky market capitalization: as of publication , BTC has nearly three times the market cap of ETH, and 24 trading volume seems to follow a similar ratio.\nWhat is causing a restirring of such flippening just might be a relatively recent milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining something in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers’ celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million. Still, the leap passed BTC also includes active addresses, perhaps a more profound metric when attempting to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500K, BTC about 25K less. BTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame\nAddresses do not equate to actual users, however. One ETH user can hold many addresses, and in the case of ETH smart contracts are also being smuggled in the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos can be telling when placed against the above stats. Ethereum wallet address are reused as a matter of course, while bitcoin core wallet address are frequently particular to each transaction. By every rational theory, BTC should far outstrip ETH in at least this category. As explained, that’s not the case. Caveats include how the 100K per day number is actually quite a fall off from as soon as the beginning of this year when ETH was clocking 300K per day at times. The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction fees and times, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC at the height of its price and corresponding media coverage only compounded block size issues. Should the flippening happen, the BTC community would have itself to blame.\nDo you think anything like the flippening is happening?

These significant fluctuations can be profited off of by trading or increasing one’s position in the underlying crypto. The upcoming week has major events for five cryptocurrencies: PRL, UKG, EOS, PKB, and BRD. The Market ConditionsIn December of 2017, Bitcoin was pushing the $20,000 mark with many experts predicting a run much higher. The bull market turned bear and BTC is currently priced at approximately $7,000 per coin. This sixty plus percent retraction has led altcoins to retract even further. Bitcoin’s dominance in the past three months has increased as the total market cap of all cryptos has decreased. BTC now makes up a greater share (percentage wise) of the total crypto markets than it did in December, when its price was 200% higher.Markets in turmoil usually scare investors away.

Bitcoin is…an irrefutable demonstration of spontaneous order in action.\nCryptocurrency is a perfect example of catallaxy and of a remedy for its polar opposite: central planning. The opposites are at war, of course.\nThe concept of “catallaxy” is similar to that of “spontaneous order,” but the latter concept can be broadly applied to most areas of life. Catallaxy applies specifically to how economic order emerges in a system through the uncoordinated and diverse actions of individuals who pursue their own self-interests. The social theorist Friedrich Hayek defined it as “the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market”.\nThe obscure term captures a dynamic that is essential to the creation of civilization: cooperation. If human beings are to rise above the level of Robinson Crusoe or savagery, then they must interact to mutual advantage. Historically, the “cooperation” is usually orchestrated by a central authority-a government, a tribal leader, a religion-that negates the voice of the individual. One reason people agree to be silenced is because they worship the authority, which makes them willingly or unthinkingly sabotage their individualism.\nAnd yet, human beings are conflicted. Most hope to be the type of person who would stand between a lynch mob and the black man it is hunting. There is a yearning to be heroic and unique, even if it is expressed by standing in a crowd in which everyone yells, “I am unique!” This is not always hypocrisy. It is often a conflicted but honest response to two antagonistic urges: worship of authority; and, the need to feel real as an individual.\nRecent centuries have given us a new paradigm of how cooperation creates civilization-a paradigm other than control from on high. Civilization rises from the grassroots. It arises through the uncoordinated and voluntary association of individuals and groups. It comes from catallaxy, which is sometimes called “catallactics.” The concept was a long-sought-after intellectual breakthrough that allowed free-market advocates to explain the evolution of society without a central authority.\nIn his masterpiece Human Action , Ludwig von Mises attributed the concept’s origin to the 19 th century economist and academic Richard Whately who wrote, “A[dam] Smith, indeed, has designated his work a treatise on the Wealth of Nations ; but this supplies a name only for the subject-matter, not for the science itself. The name I should have preferred as the most descriptive, and on the whole least objectionable, is that of catallactics, or the ‘Science of Exchanges’.” Whately sought what Mises called praxeology-the science of human action-but he focused on economics.\nDigital currencies are the most fascinating example of economic spontaneous order that has occurred in decades. It may not seem to be grassroots economics because it is so technologically sophisticated, but it is as grassroots as it gets. As a practical matter, however, free-market crypto stumbles over an obstacle. Users still buy into the trickle-down version of organization, and they tend to surrender their independence to centralized exchanges that function as central banks. Like banks, the exchanges maintain control of deposits, which is de facto ownership, and they report all transactions to the government. People are free to choose for themselves, of course, but central powers inevitably violate the principle of free choice by banning anything that competes with them for power or money.\nThus, the ideological struggle within crypto is between centralization and decentralization. Governments need the first to control the economy; individuals need the second to achieve financial independence. There can be no compromise between the two because they are antithetical. But, as a matter of brute reality, both operate side by side within most societies because they each satisfy a competing urge within many human beings: a desire for authority, and a desire to be free. Authorities benefit tremendously, of course, and their motives are clear. But they could not prevail if a sufficient percentage of the population did not agree enough to go along.\nBoth government and the free market provide conflicting models for social order and civilization.\nNo one championed the free-market dynamic more vigorously than Hayek. He argued persistently against what he called “constructive rationalism”-the belief that social order should be constructed by a central authority. He argued that it should not be but also that it could not be constructed. All that could emerge was government-imposed order, which was the opposite of social order. Hayek’s definition from The Constitution of Liberty : “ Order with reference to society thus means essentially that individual action is guided by successful forethought, that people not only make effective use of their knowledge but can also foresee with a high degree of confidence what collaboration they can expect from others.”\nHayek’s arguments differ from the usual crypto critique of trusted third parties because he does not dwell on the corruption of the system. He focuses on its disutility. Satoshi Nakamoto’s White Paper also touches on the practical flaws of the central banking system, but Hayek differs from Satoshi as well. Satoshi offers precise critiques of real practices; Hayek offers fundamental critiques of the inherent inability of the system to provide what it claims. Another way to state this: conceivably, the faults addressed by Satoshi could be corrected because they are practices. The faults attacked by Hayek are insurmountable because they form the ideological foundation of central planning.\nCentralization Versus Decentralization\nHe knew first-hand the consequences of central planning, which he called rational constructivism. Hayek had witnessed the devastation of classical liberalism by two world wars, but especially by World War I, which broke the mold of the free market. Wartime governments clamped centralized control over the private sector to ensure the flow of armaments and other “necessary” goods. Governments inflated their monies to pay for massive military build-ups. And war strangled the flow of free trade that classical liberals considered to be a prerequisite to peace, prosperity, and freedom. In short, Hayek had watched as 20 th century statism replaced 19 th century classical liberalism. Central planning was the mechanism through which freedom had been destroyed.\nIn response, Hayek developed a sophisticated system of social theory to explain how the institutions of society naturally evolved from the bottom up, which meant they could evolve once more. He maintained that the natural institutions of society were the collective and unintended results of human action. Even complex social phenomena-such as religion, language, or money-were the unintended consequences of individual interactions. For example, no central authority decided to invent human speech, let alone to design a language as specific as English. Acting solely to achieve their own ends, individuals began making sounds to facilitate getting what they wanted from others, whether the goal was economic or more personal. Speech resulted from human action but not from human design, and it naturally evolved into language. The evolution may not have proceeded with scientific efficiency, but it was efficient enough to speed along the development of civilization. The efficiency of government programs suffer by comparison, to say the least.\nYet constructivists claimed that an unplanned society is chaos. With sufficient knowledge and a scientific approach, a perfectly efficient society could be engineered. No surpluses, no scarcities, no waste. Stock markets would not crash, and currencies would not fluctuate. Society could be designed so that its members walked in unison toward the same desirable social goals, just as they marched toward victory in war.\nHayek bluntly stated that the knowledge constructivists sought is unattainable. It is not possible to plan the dynamics of tomorrow based on yesterday; predictions may be possible but knowledge is not. It is impossible because people and circumstances are erratic. Even a small thing, like the price of bread yesterday, does not give knowledge of the price tomorrow or what a person will be willing to pay. The price of bread might skyrocket due to a shortage, or the person might value the loaf differently. Using yesterday to engineer tomorrow goes against a fundamental tenet of human action: the principle of inevitable change. Human beings are fundamentally different from the physical objects examined by the hard sciences. A scientist can learn everything he needs to know about the behavior of an object, and the information might not change over time. But human beings act on psychological factors and motivations that are hidden, often from themselves. Society does not consist of objects that can be neatly categorized and made to obey the laws of science. Society consists of unpredictable individuals who react to changing circumstances.\nIn Human Action , Mises commented, “Human action originates change. As far as there is human action there is no stability, but ceaseless alteration…The prices of the market are historical facts expressive of a state of affairs that prevailed at a definite instant of the irreversible historical process….In the imaginary-and, of course, unrealizable-state of rigidity and stability there are no changes to be measured. In the actual world of permanent change there are no fixed points…”\nConclusion\nThroughout the work of Hayek and Mises, two closely related concepts emerge again and again: methodological individualism, and spontaneous order. The two concepts are an essential part of the ideological backbone that forms the structure of cryptocurrency. They also explain why the explosion of freedom brought by crypto was so unexpected. It sprang from individuals and from freedom of action.\nCryptocurrency resembles the lone-gunman theory. History stumbles along a fairly steady, though not necessarily salutary path. Then a lone gunman jumps out of nowhere and shoots Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, or some other prominent figure. In the case of Franz, the assassination sparked WWI. History changed forever.\nThe centralized financial world was stumbling along a path until crypto jumped out of the bushes and assassinated the banking system. Economic history changed forever, and it cannot be undone. But, to understand the power and potential of crypto, a clear sense of spontaneous order is necessary. The free-market model of freedom and the institutions it requires depend upon it.\n[To be continued next week.]\nReprints of this article should credit bitcoin.com and include a link back to the original links to all previous chapters\nWendy McElroy has agreed to ”live-publish” her new book The Satoshi Revolution exclusively with Bitcoin.com.

GMO Internet Inc. announced the launch via a statement on its website on May 31, 2018. The move represents the latest attempt to integrate the emerging crypto market into the mainstream gaming industry. CryptoChips: A Bitcoin Gaming Rewards Application\nCryptoChips is an application that will allow players to earn Bitcoin as rewards for playing mobile games. Players can earn these rewards by unlocking hidden levels, completing challenging missions, and several other milestones. According to GMO, CryptoChips will be premiered on its “ Whimsical War ” mobile game. Whimsical War is a real-time battle game available for both iPhone and Android smartphones.\nAccording to the CryptoChips launch announcement:\nCryptoChips can be mounted on the game application and allows players to receive cryptocurrency as remuneration within the game – like a “secret pocket money” – depending on the players’ rankings or when players have achieved missions or acquired items. The players must also have their own wallets (cryptocurrency accounts) to receive the remuneration (cryptocurrencies). The Continuing GMO Internet and Bitcoin Love Affair\nThis latest move by GMO is another step toward the company’s goal of becoming a leading figure in the global Bitcoin market. According to the company, part of the reason behind the CryptoChips launch is to increase cryptocurrency awareness around the world. By so doing, GMO is leveraging the popularity of the global gaming industry to facilitate the advancement and adoption of cryptocurrencies.\nGMO Internet is heavily involved in Bitcoin mining . The company began its mining activities in December 2017 with an initial investment of $3 million, choosing Northern Europe as its base of operations. The choice of Northern Europe as the location was based on the availability of cheap electricity as well as the favorable climate. In the space of three months, the company recouped its investment, having earned more than $3 million mining Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash . By May 2018, GMO announced that it had so far mined more than 900 BTC and 500 BCH .\nApart from Bitcoin mining, GMO Internet operates a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service . In fact, the wallet and crypto exchange platform was the company’s first foray into the world of cryptocurrencies. In December 2017, GMO also announced that it pays a percentage of staff salaries in Bitcoin .\nWill CryptoChips improve cryptocurrency adoption among members of the gaming community?

According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Bitcoin will not remain the “gold standard” of cryptocurrencies for much longer. Instead, he is convinced that altcoins will carve out their own paths and no longer rely on Bitcoin’s price momentum. Brad Garlinghouse has Some Contrarian Views\nAnyone who has paid attention to the cryptocurrency industry for more than three weeks will have noticed an interesting trend. Regardless of how successful or promising some altcoins may be, they will not thrive unless the Bitcoin price is going up. It is a very annoying trend which has hindered the growth of altcoins for some time now, unfortunately. It will be quite difficult to reverse this trend, assuming that’s possible.\nSurprisingly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is convinced things will change in favor of the altcoins fairly soon. Although he doesn’t deny the correlation between the price of XRP and the value of Bitcoin, he believes there may be a shift on the horizon. As one would expect, his statement has faced some opposition, even though most people would welcome such a change.\nWhile the cryptocurrency scene is still in its infancy after nine years, the time has come for altcoins to emerge and carve out their own paths. Whether or not any of them will be able to do so in the near future is a different matter altogether. With speculation remaining one of the bigger problems affecting market growth, there will not be any exciting developments in favor of the altcoins anytime soon.\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the decoupling of altcoin markets from Bitcoin will take place through “investor rationale”. In his view, it’s only a matter of time until investors see the value in individual cryptocurrencies and their respective technologies. At the same time, Garlinghouse believes certain altcoins will continue to ride the coattails of Bitcoin. Indeed, there have been a fair few cryptocurrencies coming to market which serve no real purpose and have no active use cases. Nor will they have any, by the look of things, even though such currencies remain extremely appealing to cryptocurrency speculators.\nWhile the comments from Garlinghouse are pretty interesting, it remains to be seen if any of his predictions will come true. After all, Bitcoin has dominated the cryptocurrency industry for quite some time now, despite the Bitcoin Dominance Index dropping below 40% this year. An interesting situation is unfolding in the cryptocurrency industry, but nothing has been set in stone just yet.

Ethereum (ETH) advocates are bringing up block explorer Etherscan declare to handed 35 million distinctive addresses, a doubling in one thing like 5 months, averaging reportedly 100Ok an afternoon. The closing to be had figures for bitcoin core (BTC) addresses had them at kind of 25 million as of spring this 12 months. ETH lovers are insisting this can be a certain step within the march to ultimately take hold of the #1 coin by marketplace capitalization spot. Also learn: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount Flippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype? Hopeful hype is beginning once more in wallet of the crypto ecosystem, particularly amongst Vitalik Buterin lovers and ETH fans. It’s because of their lengthy held trust the arena’s 2nd most well liked cryptocurrency by marketplace capitalization should ultimately exchange bitcoin core (BTC) on the most sensible in what’s been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the most productive phrase in this day and age, if most effective on account of that pesky marketplace capitalization: as of newsletter, BTC has just about thrice the marketplace cap of ETH, and 24 buying and selling quantity turns out to apply a an identical ratio. What is inflicting a restirring of such flippening simply could be a moderately contemporary milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out forward of BTC in distinctive addresses, gaining one thing in the community of 100 thousand in step with day. The quantity floating round is moderately eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the quantity previous this 12 months for plenty of causes, so ETH fans’ celebrations are primarily based most commonly on supposition, inference. The closing figures to be had for BTC had distinctive addresses round 24 million. Still, the jump handed BTC additionally comprises lively addresses, most likely a extra profound metric when making an attempt to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500Ok, BTC about 25Ok much less. BTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame Addresses don’t equate to exact customers, then again. One ETH consumer can dangle many addresses, and in terms of ETH sensible contracts also are being smuggled within the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos will also be telling when positioned in opposition to the above stats. Ethereum pockets deal with are reused as a question in fact, whilst bitcoin core pockets deal with are incessantly explicit to every transaction. By each and every rational principle, BTC must a long way outstrip ETH in a minimum of this class. As defined, that’s now not the case. Caveats come with how the 100Ok in step with day quantity is in fact somewhat a fall off from once the start of this 12 months when ETH used to be clocking 300Ok in step with day from time to time. The Crypto Winter sapped a lot of the ones information, and fact is most effective on-chain job is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for instance). In phrases of uncooked transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800Ok to 200Ok.\nFor BTC lovers, then again, who insist together with the counting of ETH sensible contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or no matter, are almost definitely at the susceptible facet of that argument. After all, as bitcoin money (BCH) is starting to display, expanding block dimension would permit for such use instances to have taken position, one thing the bitcoin core group has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction charges and occasions, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC on the peak of its value and corresponding media protection most effective compounded block dimension problems. Should the flippening occur, the BTC group would have itself in charge. Do you assume the rest just like the flippening is going on? Let us know within the feedback.

Despite the issue being reportedly resolved, the incident serves to highlight the need for decentralized, stable alternatives where possibilities of the kind are simply non-existent.\nIn an official statement on Twitter, Visa announced that their payment processing service is experiencing a “service disruption”: We are currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. We are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. We will keep you updated.\nReportedly , Visa users were experiencing serious issues with their card payments. They were receiving messages stating that there was a “disruption of service,” preventing providers receiving or sending money. Major Red Flag\nCredit card payments weren’t the only service impacted by the Visa outage. The issue also prevented many European customers from transacting with cash deposited in their bank accounts. The Irish Times reported that Irish tourists as far away as the US were unable to access their money.\nPersonal hassles aside, the outage could have triggered major issues for banking institutions as well. Reports began emerging of people lining up in front of ATMs to withdraw as much cash as possible for fear of a prolonged outage.\nBanks like HSBC started tweeting about the problem almost immediately: We are aware of an industry wide issue affecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and MasterCard transactions are not impacted. Visa are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will continue to support our impacted customers as needed.\n— HSBC UK (@HSBC_UK) June 1, 2018 Current Problem Resolved, Underlying Issues Remain\nEarlier today, almost 20 hours after Visa first acknowledged the outage, the company posted an announcement on their website, claiming that the issue had been resolved:\nVisa Europe’s payment system is now operating at full capacity, and Visa account holders can now use Visa for any of their purchases and at ATMs, as they normally would.\nYet, a certain point needs to be stressed. Visa is one of the leading payment solutions providers, with millions of people using its services around the world. While it’s unclear how many of those customers were affected by the problem, one thing is clear – a problem with a single, centralized service provider can potentially leave millions of people unbanked. Can Crypto Provide an Answer?\nIn the official announcement, Visa explained that the outage was caused by some sort of “system failure.” The question here is – can we afford to let a “system” and its support team determine whether millions of people across the world will have access to their money?\nThe problem is much larger than Visa, of course, but this particular incident clearly outlines the need for an alternative – like Bitcoin – that is immune to such “system failures.”\nDecentralization could well solve all of these problems and, ironically, Visa is no stranger to the technology. In October 2016, Visa announced that it was working on a blockchain-based solution for cross-border, business-to-business exchange. Similarly, just this past month, MasterCard filed a patent for faster node verification system.\nCould all of this be hinting that we are closer to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology?\nAmid all of the chaos caused by Visa’s outage, one simple truth emerged: Visa network goes down today.\nBitcoin has never gone down.\nDo you think decentralization is the solution that major payment processors and card issuers are in need of?

Mr. Hanyecz describes his dealings with Satoshi as having been “kind of weird.”\nAlso Read: Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day Early BTC Developer Discusses Email Exchanges with Satoshi\nMr. Hanyecz, a programmer known in the bitcoin world for paying a man from Bitcointalk.org 10,000 BTC to order him two pizzas from Papa John’s in 2010, discussed his personal interactions with Satoshi Nakamoto in a recent interview .\nAfter mining bitcoins on his laptop for some time, Mr. Hanyecz reached out to Satoshi to express his desire to contribute to the development of bitcoin. “I thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,” Hanyecz said. “Nakamoto would send me emails like ‘Hey, can you fix this bug?’ ‘Hey, can you do this?’” Mr. Hanyecz “Didn’t Want the Responsibility”\nDespite his enthusiasm for bitcoin, Mr. Hanyecz saw his contributions to the cryptocurrency as a side project of secondary importance to his career, and felt as though Satoshi had unrealistic expectations of his involvement.\n“He’d say, ‘Hey, the west side’s down,’ or ‘We have these bugs – we need to fix this.’ I’d be like, we? We’re not a team,” Mr. Hanyecz said. “I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn’t want the responsibility. I didn’t really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.”\nOn occasion, Mr. Hanyecz would express his dissatisfaction, recounting that he would say “Hey, you’re not my boss.” Despite the irritation, Mr. Hanyecz states that he “didn’t take it too seriously.” Interactions with Satoshi Consistently Gave Mr. Hanyecz “A Weird Feeling”\nMr. Hanyecz describes the majority of his interaction with bitcoin’s creator to be “kind of weird.”\nMr. Hanyecz found Satoshi to paranoid in many of their exchanges, stating “There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base. I brushed them off because I was like, who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away? This wasn’t my job or anything – it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘prerelease,’ and I was helping him get it to release.”\nLooking back, Mr. Hanyecz can empathize with Satoshi’s apparent paranoia, stating that “If anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn’t be having this conversation today.” Satoshi Weary of Mining Centralization\nAccording to Mr. Hanyecz, Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of the potential for mining to lead to centralization in bitcoin ownership, stating that Satoshi told him “Well, I’d rather not have you do the mining too much.”\nMr. Hanyecz stated that “[Satoshi] was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”\nMr. Hanyecz also stated that Satoshi was careful to maintain anonymity, stating “He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal. I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.”\nWhat’s your interpretation of the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto enigma?

Now, the method has been studied in detail by academics, who sought to point out the technique’s incredible success rate in proportion to Twitter metrics. Twitter Followers and ICO Returns\nAccording to a study by researchers from Boston College Carroll School of Management, the average returns from ICOs was noted at 179 percent, calculated from the “pre-sale” price to first listing on an exchange. Interestingly, when the study took into account ICOs that executed exit scams or failed to issue tokens, the average return rate was still an impressive 82 percent. Sponsored Links\nThe researchers noted the “abnormal behavior” of ICO returns after listing on an exchange, which typically experiences an immediate dump in prices upon first listing, but regenerate a 48 percent return to investors after just 16 days of “buy and hold.”\nThe most significant part of the study was correlating ICO returns to a project’s Twitter activity, with results indicating that interactive Twitter accounts invariably generated higher fundraising.\nThe study stated:\n“We use data from Twitter accounts of cryptocurrency firms to investigate the relationship between Twitter followers and activity, and market prices, and to measure the attrition rate of crypto-companies after completion of the ICO.” More Tweets = More Funds Raised\nThe study noted that the average length of time from the date that the platform’s Twitter account is activated to the ICO start date is about eight months, and the median value of this variable was only three months, which suggests that a large number of firms launch Twitter accounts “just in time” before token issuance.\nProjects with an active Twitter account were found to generate more publicity, and raise more funds, than projects with sporadic posts. The research found a positive relationship between market capitalization and Twitter followers, suggesting evidence of a positive externality effect when an ICO platform reaches a critical mass of users.\nHowever, cryptocurrency firms were not as active as other sector businesses in their tweets per day, with a crypto-project on an average tweeting 2.1 times a day. In comparison, traditional firms can tweet up to 22 times a day.Cryptocurrency firms did not augment the number of tweets even while an ICO was ongoing, with the average increase to just 2.7 tweets. These findings suggest that Twitter activity remains mostly constant, regardless of the project’s token issuance status.\nThe study noted that firms which displayed “stronger Twitter activity” in the days leading up to the ICO, and especially during the ICO, were more successful than their peers.\nHowever, the study noted:\n“Increased tweeting during the ICO could be a result of ICO success rather than its cause, as entrepreneurs are more likely to share good news about strong token sales.” ICO Scams Researched\nThe study indicated that 7.8 percent of ICO opened a Twitter account, but did not tweet anything during their token sales – indicating either an exit scam or fraud. Furthermore, out of the 420 companies in this category, 21 percent never bothered to open a Twitter account.\nUsing the same research methodology, the study observed that “cryptocurrency accounts are anonymous, transactions are irrevocable, and ICOs are unregulated,” rendering a high number of scams and theft. Apart from the firms which were innately fraudulent, the study observed that in some cases hackers infiltrated wallet addresses on the ICO website, and diverted funds from the legitimate destination toward their own.\nFurthermore, the study suggests that not all ICOs may be as fraudulent as concluded, as it was observed in some case that companies which failed to raise their target figures diligently proceeded to return the funds to investors.\nIn conclusion, the paper shows that investors in “new unproven platforms” were “handsomely rewarded,” and in most cases, investors did their due diligence to identify the scam ICOs.\nThe study noted:\n“While our results could be an indication of a bubble, they are also consistent with high compensation for risk for investing in pre-revenue platforms through unregulated offerings.”\nThe full study, titled “Digital Tulips?

Bitcoin is trading lower by 1.29%, making it a middle crypto performer on the day. EOS was today’s worst performer, with losses of 2.73%, while Ripple also traded lower on the session with losses of 0.27%. Today’s Top Crypto Performances\nThe trend in cryptocurrencies remained lower on the day, moving in-line with the longer-term outlook for the asset class. Bitcoin underperformed some of the major cryptocurrencies today, and technical analysis readings suggest that this may continue tomorrow. Short-term Chart View: Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar\nSupport Level: 7330\nResistance Level: 7600\nBTC Short-term Price Direction: Sideways\nOn the short-term time frames, Bitcoin is showing sideways readings. Against the U.S. dollar, the price of Bitcoin has moved little over the last 24 hours. Market prices are now trading at 7517 against the USD. Bitcoin is trading at the middle of its recent trading range, and the technical indicator readings have turned neutral at 50. The RSI indicator is falling, which indicates a decline in momentum. If we see a break of the uptrend line on the 30-minute charts, traders will likely consider moving into new short positions in BTC. Long-term Chart View: Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar\nSupport Level: 7090\nResistance Level: 7930\nBTC Long-term Price Direction: Down\nOn the long-term time frames, the picture is much more bearish. Bitcoin has been caught in a downtrend since May 4, 2018. Bitcoin is trading at the lower end of its long-term trading range, and this suggests that contrarian crypto traders might take advantage of these lower levels to buy the cryptocurrency and try pushing prices higher. Long-term, the technical indicator readings have turned neutral. The RSI indicator is trading near the midpoint at 50, which indicates stalling momentum. On the other hand, if we see a break of the downtrend line on the 4-hour charts, traders will likely consider moving into new long positions in BTC. Bitcoin Trader’s Outlook\nThe recent market activity in Bitcoin suggests a mixed outlook for the market-leading cryptocurrency. Short-term indicators are neutral, and a loss of trendline resistance could force a retest of the previous highs near 7600. Long-term indicators are more bearish, and a break of the prevailing downtrend line could inspire bullish trading activity for Bitcoin traders interested in taking long-term positions.

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China. They can also be followed through Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and Wechat accounts.

And so the presumption is that we will be able to use bitcoin like we use money, handiest on-line. However BitPay and their companions are appearing how Bitcoin’s subsequent large use case is probably not preordering your espresso, however enabling companies to speak in confidence international markets.\nFor corporations taking a look to move international, Bitcoin generally is a godsend. The hoops that must be jumped via, the laws, the banks, forex conversion, are a great deal lessened via the usage of Bitcoin.\nConsider a Chinese language on-line consumer making an attempt to shop for a virtual merchandise from any individual in the US. As the vast majority of Chinese language customers don’t have bank cards and as an alternative use debit playing cards which can be related to Chinese language banks, this isn’t as simple as it is going to appear. A virtual merchandise must be a painless procedure to buy on-line in any jurisdiction however historic fiat banking gadget makes it anything else however. First, the client’s yuan would must be transferred to bucks at a Chinese language financial institution. Then the cash must input the SWIFT community via any other financial institution. A couple of days or even weeks later it might “arrive” on the corresponding SWIFT financial institution in the US who would then, in any case, switch it to the vendor’s financial institution.\nAnd within that procedure, there are a minimum of two charges. A charge for changing yuan to US bucks and any other for the use of the SWIFT community. Relying at the particular person banks, extra charges may well be incorporated, like a world acquire charge. All of the whilst the service provider may have two possible choices: ship the article straight away and hope that the cash if truth be told arrives, or wait till the cash arrives and chance shedding the client to a home vendor who can ship faster. Granted, services and products like Paypal and its subsidiary Xoom simplify this procedure a great deal, however no longer everybody makes use of it, no longer each Chinese language financial institution works with Xoom and there can also be delays that remaining days.\nWith Bitcoin, the client merely sends Bitcoin, the Service provider will get it virtually in an instant (or as much as an hour if the service provider needs to watch for blockchain confirmations) after which sends the article to the patron. No mess, low charges.\nAt the face of it, that would possibly no longer look like a large deal. There most certainly aren’t that many of us from america promoting virtual merchandise to Chinese language consumers, particularly since there are large variations in the preferred social and gaming platforms between the ones two nations. However the above instance was once used for simplicity sake. There are many actual firms that need to promote precise merchandise in China however are averted from doing so on account of monetary pink tape.\nIn a contemporary weblog publish, Bitpay who processed $1.2B in bills remaining 12 months laid out an instance of the way they’re serving to facilitate international business via B2B transactions that will were harder in conventional finance.\n“Bellatorra CEO Nathan Halsey in the past ran a skin-care corporate which operated for 4 years in China. They discovered roadblocks to expansion – particularly, they had been handiest in a position to obtain money transactions from their shoppers because of cross-border forex change barriers. […] When a Chinese language cosmetics distributor not too long ago approached Halsey and his present corporate Bellatorra about the use of bitcoin to pay for a wholesale cargo, the sport modified. Bellatorra and the Chinese language wholesaler became to [BitPay] to procedure the six-figure fee. […] Now Bellatorra is transferring to make use of bitcoin in additional transactions, with values processed by way of BitPay anticipated to develop by means of 10X within the close to time period.”\nWe spoke with Sonny Singh, CCO of Bitpay at Consensus 2018 to speak about B2B bills and he defined the monetary advantages for companies.\n“We’re permitting international consumers to have their providers pay them in bitcoin as it’s inexpensive and faster than a financial institution twine. We will be able to transfer from maximum puts on the planet in a single trade day for a 1% charge whilst global wires typically take round three days and value three%.”\nAnd that is incessantly the side of the crypto revolution this is incessantly forgotten. As helpful as crypto is for people and as thrilling as the massive monetary establishment’s doable involvements are, it’s in all probability the medium-sized and small companies that experience probably the most to realize from cryptocurrencies. Multinational firms have the connections and bankroll to make promoting pieces out of the country somewhat simple and winning. Folks the use of Bitcoin for remittance is thrilling whether it is completed en masse however getting customers to modify has confirmed to be an extended and slow procedure.\nMedium and small companies have so much to realize by means of the use of bitcoin in B2B transactions. Certain, the use of bitcoin as a fee choice for normal consumers has doable rewards, however like remittance, the ones rewards received’t be reaped till bitcoin hits the mainstream.\nFirst, the charges make much more sense. With small transactions, bitcoin doesn’t all the time have that giant of a bonus over conventional finance on the subject of charges. With Lightning, that can alternate, however regardless it’s laborious to persuade shoppers to switch financial techniques to save lots of a couple of greenbacks on one merchandise. The one means it really works is for those who persuade 1000’s of consumers to do it, and that has confirmed tough. It’s a lot more uncomplicated to get one corporate to switch their gadget for a couple of proportion issues that may upload up through the years. Particularly with resellers, the place margins are small and the marketplace is extremely aggressive.\nWith the Bellatorra instance, and the inside track that gold broker Sharps Pixley is the use of BitPay to allow each gold to bitcoin and bitcoin to gold transactions, BitPay is appearing how the bitcoin use case query is probably not solved with the massive monetary giants or particular person shoppers, however the 1000’s of small and medium-sized companies within the center.

June 2, 2018 — JMD Terrorist financing through Bitcoin?\nAccording to a recent report, terrorist groups including Al Qaeda and ISIL are increasingly turning to Bitcoin to finance their activities. The authors cite several examples, including: The tech talk section of Al-Haqiqa, a pro-Al Qaeda English-language magazine, released in February 2018, examined the permissibility of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund their activities; In 2014, an article released by Islamic State supporters detailed how Bitcoin can limit exposure to the Western financial system, and recommended using Bitcoin to provide funds to ISIL and and supporters travelling to Syria; Bahrun Naim, the alleged mastermind behind the 2016 Jakarta terrorist attack, reported to have used Bitcoin to transfer funds to militants and fund other activities (as well as PayPal); Ghost Security Group reported that the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack was funded by Al Qaeda through Bitcoin.\nAnalysis: Terrorist groups will use any financing means at their disposal, including new technologies. Whether there is widespread adoption of any new technology by a terrorist group depends entirely on whether or not they are successful in their activities, and how many of them are caught during their attempts. Terrorist groups are adaptive, and if Bitcoin is deemed vulnerable to law enforcement interventions, groups will quickly move on to another technology of means of financing their activities.

After the onslaught which traders have witnessed throughout most of 2018, the future price direction remains unclear. Economist Joost van der Burgt is confident Bitcoin will fall even further in value pretty soon. Another Doom Scenario for Bitcoin\nAnyone who has paid attention to Bitcoin price predictions over the past year may have noticed that financial ‘experts’ don’t expect a bright future for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That is not entirely surprising, especially considering that the year 2018 hasn’t been too positive so far. Even so, optimism remains in place overall, as bigger and better things seem on the horizon for this industry.\nIf economist Joost van der Burgt is to be believed, the future will not look all that bright. More specifically, he is confident that Bitcoin is still in a massive bubble as of right now. Assuming that is the case, this may only be the beginning of the profit-taking stage. This seems to indicate van der Burgt is confident the Bitcoin price will drop below $5,000 soon, although most market speculators envision an entirely different future.\nUp to this point, there has been no evidence of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency being in a bubble. While it is true that volatility has reigned supreme throughout most of 2018, this is no different from how the market has evolved in the past few years. Bitcoin’s price is still relatively easy to manipulate, but it seems new regulatory developments will make cryptocurrency a lot more attractive to the mainstream.\nAccording to van der Burgt, the Bitcoin “bubble” is now entering a euphoric stage. He compares the current cryptocurrency price trend with the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis. It’s a very interesting comparison, even though the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by a culmination of multiple factors, rather than hype for a specific project or offering.\nThe economist noted:\nThe euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments. According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.\nAt the same time, one has to acknowledge cryptocurrencies are very different from any investment vehicle the world has seen before. While it may not necessarily become the new breed of global currencies, there appear to be many use cases for Bitcoin and other worthwhile currencies. That doesn’t mean every altcoin will succeed, but the future isn’t looking as gloomy as van der Burght would like people to believe.

Version analysts\nBitcoin mining unprofitable due to the falling exchange rate of the coin — the profit of the owners of the farms exceed the costs only 6 percent, mentioned in the March study Fundstrat. And although analysts promise the growth rate of the first cryptocurrency in the coming months, in the future miners will receive a new trial. In may 2020, the amount of remuneration for the production unit will be reduced by half — from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. About possible changes of prices on the background of the event says . the What to expect miners forecast of analysts\nRally of Bitcoin prices could take place in 2021. Such conclusion analysts made after the analysis: in previous times it happened in 2013 and 2017. In both cases the year before (2012 and 2016), the remuneration of the miners has been halved.\nIf the reduction in the remuneration of miners and the Bitcoin price there is indeed some correlation, it is connected with the influence of the first phenomenon on hash rate and stability of the coin. The question is not how a 50 percent reduction will affect the price of the cryptocurrency, and what impact it will have on miners. Lower remuneration for solved block directly affects the earnings of the miners, especially with the constant complexity.\nHowever, the analyst Garik Hileman believes that miners will not cut production.\nthe Miners have historically demonstrated the ability to maintain production at the same level or even increase power. The reason is that they hope for further growth of Bitcoins, which will cover all their costs.\nit Seems that soon we are waiting for another price increase. But now is a good time .

The International Monetary Fund seems confident there is no need to regulate this industry at this stage, even though other officials see things differently. Dong He of the IMF is convinced that cryptocurrencies may replace central bank money in the future, but now is not the time. Dong He on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency\nIt is always interesting to note how different financial experts perceive the future of cryptocurrency. Considering that this new form of money is still incredibly volatile, it is evident that there is a lot of work to be done moving forward. The IMF’s Dong He, for one, wrote that the cryptocurrency industry is far too volatile to pose any threat to the fiat currencies which people use today.\nThat doesn’t mean this situation will not change in the future. The way things stand right now, there is a growing interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which may disrupt the financial sector sooner rather than later. At this stage, however, the main focus should be on stabilizing the Bitcoin price, but that will be difficult to achieve.\nOne thing holding global cryptocurrency adoption back is its technical deficiencies. While Bitcoin has a high value as of right now, it is rather evident that scaling solutions need to be implemented sooner rather than later. The Lightning Network may change a lot of things, although it remains to be seen how powerful this technology will really be when everything is said and done.\nCentral banks suffer from deficiencies as well, though. Competitive pressure brought to the table by crypto assets means central banks will need to step up their game. Conducting effective monetary policy, for example, will remain one of their top priorities. Additionally, it seems a lot of banks are preparing to offer exposure to various cryptocurrencies moving forward. In some cases, it is better to embrace competition than oppose inevitable change.\nIn Dong He’s words:\nThere are both challenges and opportunities for central banks in the digital age. Central banks must maintain the public’s trust in fiat currencies and stay in the game in a digital, sharing, and decentralized service economy. They can remain relevant by providing more stable units of account than crypto assets and by making central bank money attractive as a medium of exchange in the digital economy.\nDepending on how things evolve, cryptocurrencies could fulfill “more of the functions of money in some regions”, according to Dong He. That is a rather interesting comment, although it doesn’t mean there will be any major shifts in this regard. For central banks, it is of the utmost importance to keep tabs on any developments in these innovative industries, and perhaps jump on the bandwagon when the time arises.

The government can exaggerate or reduce the prices of these currencies without any democratic participation. This also means that high levels of supervision and government censorship led to manipulation, but then Bitcoin appeared again. Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency that is not controlled by anyone and does not require third-party intervention. It was created in 2008 by a character named Satoshi Nakamoto. His identity is still unknown, and after a few years of revolutionary technology that introduced the world to Bitcoin, he disappeared from the online world. The value of Bitcoin has been increasing over the years because of its high visibility and many people make a lot of money from it. There is no core digital control bitcoin, but it is regulated by the peer-to-peer network, providing it with a functional basis without the need for external numbers. Bitcoin is a kind of democracy currency because it will not be influenced or manipulated by some rich people because of their benefits and interests. Most people have heard of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but there are many mysteries surrounding this terminology. Therefore, most people are hesitant to invest in this lucrative currency. Because of its increasing popularity, bitcoin has become almost a buzzword for the past few years. But the important question is how does Bitcoin work? Is this a good investment opportunity? How can you buy Bitcoin? If you want to answer these questions, then this is the book you need. Bitcoin is changing the world. In the next 20 years, it may become the currency used by everyone in the world. Some governments, such as the governments of Japan and Switzerland, publicly support it, while others strictly prohibit its use. Bitcoin grows every day, and those in the game have already earned thousands of dollars from it. So if you want to understand what the hype is, you find the right book.

A new lead to the movie business\nSlate intends to broadcast the documentary Beyond Bitcoin via its blockchain based online streaming platform Binge. The decentralized Binge platform provides low-cost, high-speed, high-definition media access for consumers worldwide, says the text of the press release.\nDuring the Cannes festival in May 2018, Slate appeared at the center of the buzz surrounding blockchain technology and its potential to alter the entertainment industry. In Cannes, Slate announced their newly formed partnership with Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival (Sitges), where Sitges will adopt its digital ticketing platform, Slatix , powered by the cryptocurrency SLATE SLX, for the purchase of tickets and festival passes.\n“This will mark the first time in industry history that a film festival will accept cryptocurrency as well as traditional forms of payment”, says the Slate press release.\nSlatix is a blockchain-based, low-cost tokenized ticketing system that aims to provide benefits to consumers based on their loyalty. According to the press release, small and medium sized enterprises can benefit from Slatix’s low setup and operating costs, while the user-friendly app is intended to simplify DIY ticket distribution and redemption. Listings and token sale\nBased in Toronto and Los Angeles, the Slate Entertainment Group has launched several media platforms on its own blockchain, including Binge and Slatix.\nSlate has launched its presale in May 2018. The public token presale will remain open until June 9, 2018. So far, the Slate team has overpassed its soft cap goal, having raised over $20 mln. The current discount is 45 percent and bonus is 3 percent.\nAs the Slate team reported to Cointelegraph, Hong Kong based HitBTC, one of the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, will be listing SLX on its exchange. HitBTC will host SLX with trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).\n“Slate Entertainment Group is especially pleased to announce the agreement during the presale as it assures buyers that they will be able to trade SLX on the open market. The listing on a major exchange will also expand SLX’s exposure to new markets and increase distribution after the initial sale” says the press release.\nDisclaimer.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe market capitalization of the crypto world has increased by about $25 billion since May 29. The Italian political crisis and the probable escalation of a trade war have attracted investors back into cryptocurrencies. Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management believes that Bitcoin has made a bottom for the year. He proposes to buy now when the prices are still low, to benefit from the ensuing rally in the next few months. We have been voicing a similar opinion for the past few days but we believe that the purchases should be staggered to take advantage of the volatility. Bitcoin continues to be the undeniable leader. It sets the direction that is followed by most altcoins. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple believes that once the crypto markets mature, they will start differentiating between the digital currencies and the correlation with Bitcoin will reduce. He, however, warned that 99 percent of the virtual currencies in circulation will vanish in about a decade. Only the ones that solve a real problem will remain. There have been a few complains that we don’t mention the fundamentals in our analysis. In technical analysis, we believe that the charts discount all the fundamental news. Hence, we only read the patterns on the chart and try to forecast the probable direction. In the past few months, these patterns have kept us on the right side of the trade and have helped us avoid large losses. We try to avoid trading during major events, due to the uncertainty. Let’s see, what direction are the charts pointing to today. BTC/USD We believe that Bitcoin is trading in a large range of $6,075.04 to $12,172.43. The strategy to trade such a large range is to buy near the bottom and sell close to the top. So, we have been waiting to buy on a sharp dip below $7,000, as close to the bottom of the range as possible, so that our risk is less. If the $6,075.04 level breaks, the digital currency can fall to $5,450 levels. The BTC/USD pair is presently facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will again face resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Once this level is crossed, a move to the 50-day SMA is possible. We retain our preference to buy on a sharp dip but only after the fall is arrested. Therefore, we suggest waiting for a couple of days to get better clarity. ETH/USD Ethereum has been gradually rising, moving towards the 20-day EMA where it will face a stiff resistance. Just above the 20-day EMA is the resistance line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, which will also act as a major hurdle. On the downside, the intraday low of May 28 at $492.5 will act as a strong support. If this level holds, we shall consider long positions but if the level breaks, a fall to $464.65 is probable. We don’t find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we are not proposing any trade on the ETH/USD pair. XRP/USD Ripple formed a doji candlestick pattern on May 30 and followed it up with an insider day candlestick pattern on May 31. Today also, the digital currency is on track to form a doji. This shows uncertainty among the traders. The XRP/USD pair fell below the 20-day EMA on May 08 and has sustained below it ever since. If the next dip holds above $0.54, it will indicate buying at lower levels. We suggest waiting for this retest to hold before buying on a rebound above the 20-day EMA. If the bears break below $0.54, the decline can extend to $0.45. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has not been able to find buyers after rising above the downtrend line. It formed a doji on May 30, followed it up with an inside day on May 31 and is likely to make another doji today. The BCH/USD pair has a tendency to trade in a tight range for a few days before making a decisive move. On the upside, the 20-day EMA will act as a resistance, above which a rally to the 50-day SMA is possible. On the downside, $878 and $750 are the supports to watch out for. We suggest waiting for the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA for initiating any long positions. EOS/USD EOS has a major event coming up on June 02 with its Mainnet launch. It is difficult to predict the price action after such an important event. Due to the uncertainty, we shall not suggest any trade on it. However, we shall mention the important levels to watch out for, both on the upside and the downside. Since May 23, the EOS/USD pair is stuck in a range between $10.3384-$12.9870. A breakout and close above $13 gives it a minimum target objective of $15.6356, which can extend to $18.67 because there is no major resistance once $15.15 is crossed. On a breakdown from the range, the digital currency can slide to $7.6898. LTC/USD Litecoin is struggling to find buyers even at the current levels. It has failed to break out of the downtrend line for the past two days. The LTC/USD pair has strong resistances between the downtrend line and $127. We shall turn positive only if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $127. Above this level, the digital currency should quickly move up to $140 and above it to the downtrend line of the descending triangle at $158 levels. If the digital currency fails to rally above $127, it will remain range bound between $107-$127 for the next few days. We shall wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $127 before recommending a long position. ADA/USD The 20-day EMA and the horizontal line at $0.23 are acting as a strong resistance. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this level, Cardano should pick up momentum and rally to the 50-day SMA and above it to $0.35. The traders can enter long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.23 and the stops can be kept below the May 28 intraday lows. If the ADA/USD pair returns from the current levels, it will find a strong buying support at $0.17. If the level fails to hold, it can slide to the bottom of the range at $0.13. We suggest buying only 50 percent of the desired allocation above $0.23 because volatility will remain high inside the range. XLM/USD Stellar has sustained above the downtrend line for the past three days, which is a positive indication. It is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA but has not given up much ground, which shows that the bulls are not keen to book profits at this level. On a close above the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair should rally to the 50-day SMA, followed by a move to $0.385. The traders can initiate long positions once the price closes (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA. The stop loss can be kept below the recent lows. On the downside, a break below the May 29 intraday low of $0.24288 can sink the digital currency to $0.184. IOTA/USD Contrary to our expectation , IOTA easily broke out of $1.63 and the 20-day EMA on May 31. It is currently at the 50-day SMA but considering the strong momentum, it looks like the rally will extend to $2.2117. We anticipate a strong resistance at $2.2117 levels. Any correction from $2.2117 will have a strong support at $1.63. If the bulls force a break out of $2.2117, likelihood of the start of a new uptrend increase, which has a minimum target objective of $3.5084. There is a minor resistance at $2.6977 but we believe that it will be crossed this time. Therefore, we shall wait for a break out of $2.2117 levels or wait for a dip to $1.63 levels to enter long positions. We don’t find any trade setup at the current levels; hence, we are not suggesting a trade on the IOTA/USD pair.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Escape will cancel and close the window.\nToday, people tend to view the world of blockchains as inhabited by two broad factions: One favors “permissionless” ledgers like Bitcoin, where anyone can join, while the other camp, backed by many in the business community, prefers a pre-approval, or “permissioned,” system. The two sides typically talk past each other and, frequently, regard the other with suspicion and resentment.\n“It’s very divided,” says Amber Baldet, CEO and co-founder of Clovyr, a startup that’s creating a platform—not unlike Salesforce’s Heroku—for developers and businesses to build and manage decentralized apps across both public and enterprise blockchains. The former blockchain leader at JPMorgan Chase visited Fortune’s studios to discuss the intra-industry, ideological clash on the latest episode of Balancing The Ledger, a new show about the intersection of finance and technology.\n(You can read more about Baldet in this month’s Fortune 500 issue of the magazine.) This controversy is rooted in whether one of the most prized qualities of Bitcoin—its wide decentralization among unnamed users—should be inherent to all blockchains. While corporations favor permissioned blockchains so they can control who they do business with, critics argue that the centralized nature of such a system undermines the original purpose of the technology.\nIn Baldet’s view, part of the problem is rooted in the terminology. “I really think that nomenclature just isn’t helpful,” Baldet says, referring to the commonplace partitioning of public versus enterprise blockchains.
