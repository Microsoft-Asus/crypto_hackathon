Send me a copy: Ready-made cryptocurrency mining kits lure more than geeks in Singapore\nBitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\nTheir customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,â€ said one of the sources.Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment. \"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval. Visiting its factory, he said: â€œno matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally youâ€™re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software. Last year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain. \"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power. \"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. \"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months. While soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. Why, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin. “Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. But the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along. Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. “Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242] Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment. “Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm. Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens. Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain. Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval. Visiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software. Last year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain. “Its not your everyday investment world,” said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold. HIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power. “We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,” Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE’s second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager. Other companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan’s smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. “The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,” said Kenetic’s Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan’s IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list. People involved in Canaan’s IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months. While soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan’s industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal. In Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns. - Reuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.joomarketer.com/joomla-extensions/joomsharebar"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "joomla social hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:25:09.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3e59404ca3278f1b6e3e073eb4573eb4d685f7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSNW0WXnB3CGd3og0dwkDL41lpP4_La.Oyz5PK4QEwGcTS7J5D6U7E", "site_full": "www.phcorner.net", "site": "phcorner.net", "site_section": "http://www.phcorner.net/f/smart-talk-n-text-sun.135/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Smart, Talk 'N Text, & Sun", "title": "Free bitcoins", "title_full": "Free bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-22T04:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.phcorner.net/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3e59404ca3278f1b6e3e073eb4573eb4d685f7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSNW0WXnB3CGd3og0dwkDL41lpP4_La.Oyz5PK4QEwGcTS7J5D6U7E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "warlockcomrade (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T04:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free bitcoins", "text": "Welcome to PHCorner Forums.

Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to US$2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Advertisement\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan (US$56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.

Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 per cent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from US$1,000 in January last year to more than US$19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about US$8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 per cent of their 2017 peak at roughly US$17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise US$2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between US$500 million and US$1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

Mining them is 60% less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. “Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40% this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPromised land\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37% of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports.\nMarket test\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market – a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. Slideshow (2 Images)\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company.

Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation 2330 (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. Why, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. But the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along. Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. \"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment. \"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm. Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens. Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain. Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval. Visiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software. Last year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain. \"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold. HIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power. \"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager. Other companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. \"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list. People involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months. While soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal. In Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

It is estimated that the global bitcoin industry is now worth $300 billion and is widely used in Northern Europe and North America.\nA lawmaker, Rep. Henry Ong of Leyte, also recommended that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the banking and remittance sectors should craft and execute an action plan to reduce the cost of sending remittances from overseas Filipinos to their dependents to three percent.\nTo cut costs, the Bangko Sentral, banks, and financial intermediaries must work in concert to streamline the cost structure, reduce cost barriers, and eliminate red tape.\n“Globally, sending remittances costs an average of 7.13 percent of the amount sent. This figure is used to monitor the progress of the global effort for reduction of remittance prices,” according to the World Bank.\n“If the cost of sending remittances could be reduced by 5 percentage points relative to the value sent, remittance recipients in developing countries would receive over $16 billion dollars more each year than they do now,” the World Bank said. “This added income could then provide remittance recipients more opportunity for consumption, savings, and investment in local economies.”\nFor the Philippines, key factors for reducing remittance costs are transparency, speed of transfer, margins on the exchange rates, systems security, and availability of remittance outlets near the residences of OFW dependents. — Ayed Sison", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alipay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry ong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "newsbytes philippines home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:14:26.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e506edd7c40b6ead2a745d8f74dd50e2f08a985", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpub.IUdVs2F83XxehpHyvVhB5YOvSeYrYqg", "site_full": "themerkle.com", "site": "themerkle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,200 – The Merkle", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,200 – The Merkle", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/daily-chart-59.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90224, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e506edd7c40b6ead2a745d8f74dd50e2f08a985", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpub.IUdVs2F83XxehpHyvVhB5YOvSeYrYqg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,200 – The Merkle", "text": "Shares 0\nAt press time, bitcoin is trading for roughly $8,220 – about $130 less than where it stood yesterday.\nOne source places current resistance levels at $8,600, which bitcoin was previously unable to break. The currency rose to the $8,500 mark 48 hours ago, but has incurred subsequent drops ever since. In addition, bitcoin has also failed to sustain previous support levels at $8,300, thus leading to the most recent drop.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat (whom we’ve discussed in our last two price articles) is again in the news . He’s sticking to his guns and insists bitcoin will reach $25,000 by the end of 2018. However, he is clarifying his words by saying that bitcoin does not need to experience price hikes “every day” to reach this goal.\nIn an interview with CNBC , Lee explained:\n“We have to keep in mind that Bitcoin at $8,000 and Bitcoin, let’s say we think it can reach $25,000. It does not require Bitcoin to go up every day until the end of the year. Remember – the ten best days account for all the return of Bitcoin. If you didn’t own Bitcoin for ten days each year, you lost 25 percent a year since 2010.”\nAt press time, support levels for the currency have fallen to roughly $8,150, and more bear trends are expected in the coming days. Should things move further in this direction, bitcoin could fall to $8,000 even, though a reversal might see it swinging towards $9,300. However, worst case scenario would see bitcoin dropping to as low as $7,969, with a mid-point average of $8,300. In other words, the currency could wind up staying as it is for some time.\nToday is Bitcoin Pizza Day , and this could potentially push the currency’s publicity a little further. Approximately eight years ago, a computer programmer allegedly paid around 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. Today, those coins would be worth more than $80 million. Hence, May 22 has since become a “national holiday” for bitcoin and pizza enthusiasts alike.\nIn an interview with The New York Times , Laszlo Hanyecz – the programmer who purchased the pies with crypto – says he has no regrets about the situation.\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” he stated.\nA Twitter account is providing 24-hour updates regarding how much the pizzas would have cost today based on the latest bitcoin prices. Cryptocurrency news platform Coindesk has also released its own Bitcoin Pizza Day price tracker.\nThe event is likely to give bitcoin a few pushes along the way, though the big move enthusiasts need to witness is further acceptance amongst retail clients, which has been relatively slow. Many merchants refuse to accept bitcoin due its ongoing volatility. According to one Morgan Stanley analyst:\n“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking.”\nThe good news, however, is that we are continuing to witness stronger institutional capital entering the crypto-space via Wall Street and major brokers. Perhaps this is the doorway bitcoin needs to solidify its presence in the retail world.

The market mood is hinting some pessimism, but let's see what the technicals tell us.\nBTC/USD 4H chart\nBitcoin is trading above the trendline from the Diamond formation that has contained its movement during the last weeks. The presence of three important moving averages just above where it is located sets an important challenge for any bullish attempts, allowing a certain margin in the bearish side that might cover some ground without breaking the current technical outlook. The 50-EMA is the closest one, halting the bullish leg from the recent hours. On the upside, the 100-SMA has crossed to the downside the 200-SMA, which still slightly maintains its bullish profile.\nOn the upside, the first complex area to beat in the confluence is located between a price resistance at $8386 and the mentioned 50-EMA, trading at $8427. Above there, we would quickly find the following price resistance at $8538, followed by the 100-SMA at the $8715 mark. Breaking above the $8905 where the 200-SMA is located would be great news for the bulls, carrying then enough momentum to enter a scenario favorable for the rises.\nOur Technical Confluence Indicator can really help us to follow these levels:\nBelow the current price, an important support is located at $8172, where a trendline and a price congestion support meet. Below there, the area between the $8000 levels and the $7585 represents the last line separating the current lateral action from a seriously bearish scenario in the mid-term.\nMACD in the Bitcoin 4-hour chart is slightly crossed to the downside, but still above the 0 line. This backs a slightly bearish lateral movement for the upcoming periods. A slide above the superior side of the Diamond formation is still the most probable scenario.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart shows a slight advantage to the sellers, that have been increasing their positioning in the last periods, but still haven't been able to drag the ADX, which is still trading in the lows.

New rules proposed | Colorado Springs Gazette, News", "text": "Should bitcoin be allowed for Colorado campaign contributions? New rules proposed By: Marianne Goodland Colorado Politics May 22, 2018 Updated: May 22, 2018 at 10:24 am 0 View Gallery View Comments\nCould Colorado be ready to accept bitcoin as a way of making donations to candidates?\nSecretary of State Wayne Williams is proposing rules that could start that process. But the better question, according to one lawmaker, is whether candidates should accept bitcoin, or other forms of cryptocurrency, as campaign contributions.\nWilliams' proposed rules, issued last week, would allow a campaign committee to accept contributions in cryptocurrency up to the acceptable limit for a cash or coin campaign contribution. For legislative candidates, that's $400 per individual or business per election cycle; for statewide offices, such as governor, secretary of state, attorney general and treasurer, that's $1,150.\nThe draft rule also says the amount of the contribution is the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the contribution. That's an important distinction, says Democratic state Rep. Jovan Melton of Aurora, who was one of several lawmakers who tried during the recently concluded session to start Colorado down the regulatory process for dealing with cryptocurrency.\nWilliams' office will accept comments on the proposed rules through Wednesday, May 23.\nBitcoin is the best known unit in the world cryptocurrency market, a market that's more volatile than the stock exchange. Cryptocurrency - and Melton says there are between 50 and 80 different sources - was started in the early 2000s but took off in 2009 with bitcoin, which was developed by an anonymous computer programmer whose true identity has never been revealed. The currency bypasses traditional banks, instead relying on a computer algorithm, a sort of electronic transaction that can be bought and sold.\nThe volatility of cryptocurrency gives Melton pause when considering it as a campaign donation. For example: on Jan. 1, 2018, CoinDesk, which tracks cryptocurrency values, said one bitcoin was priced at more than $13,400. On May 18, the value was $8,200, and that's a drop of more than $700 in the past week alone.\nOne of the rules around transactions involving bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is in their permanence: once a transaction has been made, it can't be canceled.\nHow that would play out in Colorado campaign finance doesn't appear to be addressed in the proposed rules. For example, how would a campaign refund a donation that exceeds the contribution limits, especially since sometimes it takes days or weeks to catch those excess donations? Given the volatility of cryptocurrency, the value of that donation is likely to change within a matter of a few hours.\nAt the federal level, candidates have been allowed to accept bitcoin as donations since 2014, but with a few guardrails. One rule requires the campaign to convert the donation to cash, although that's not required immediately, and prohibits using the electronic currency to pay for goods or services. Another rule allows the donation to sit in a kind of account, referred to in the Federal Election Commission rule as a bitcoin wallet, for as long as the committee wants to hold onto it.\nThe FEC treats a bitcoin donation as an in-kind contribution, similar to a donation of stock or securities. The value is what it is at the time of liquidation, rather than at the time the bitcoin (or a fraction of a bitcoin) is donated.\nFor reporting purposes, both at the federal level and in the Secretary of State's proposed rules, the value of the donation is whatever the value of the bitcoin is on the day of the donation. The proposed rule states that any additional value or loss must be reported in the campaign finance reports when the bitcoin is finally liquidated. Like the federal rules, the proposed rule doesn't require the bitcoin be converted to cash at the time of the contribution.\nAnother concern raised about cryptocurrency is in its anonymity. Banks verify the identity of those who make transactions. Bitcoin does not, according to CoinDesk. That can be a problem for Colorado candidates who must verify the source and employment of those who make donations. The proposed rules don't appear to address that issue, either.\nDeputy Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert acknowledged that accepting bitcoin donations, which campaigns can do now, may create a bit of a bookkeeping headache for campaigns. She told Colorado Politics it's still up to the donor to identify him or herself for purposes of campaign contributions, which is how the system currently operates. The proposed rules are intended to start the process for regulating those donations, she explained.\nWhile bitcoin donations have been allowed at the federal level, state candidates have been a little more leery. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis of Boulder started accepting bitcoin contributions to his congressional election campaign almost immediately after those donations were approved by the FEC in 2014, and quickly received more than $1,000.\nBut as far as his gubernatorial campaign is concerned: nada. There's no option for making a bitcoin donation on his campaign website.\nRepublican State Sen. Owen Hill of Colorado Springs, who is challenging U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn in the June 26 primary, announced back in January he would accept bitcoin contributions. But his website doesn't show any way to do that, and his FEC filings so far don't show that he's taken in any bitcoin donations.\nAnd other states have also been cautious about getting into bitcoin donations. So far, according to the Wisconsin Journal-Sentinel, only Montana and Washington, D.C., allow those donations to state candidates. A gubernatorial candidate in New Hampshire announced in 2014 he would accept Bitcoin donations. But it's never been allowed under state campaign finance rules, according to a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Secretary of State.\nMelton, the Democratic state representative, says he is a big fan of bitcoin but believes the proposed rules are premature. He told Colorado Politics he intends to work with the state divisions of banking and securities throughout the summer to come up with regulatory guidelines for the use of bitcoin and other such cryptocurrencies in campaigns.\nHe looks forward to the day when bitcoin can be accepted as donations but believes that day has not yet come. \"What if I'm given $400 [in Bitcoin] today, and it's valued at $500 tomorrow? I personally wouldn't accept it,\" Melton said. Register to the Colorado Springs Gazette Incognito Mode Your browser is in Incognito mode You vanished!

Contrastingly, lately, he has shown much interest and belief in the blockchain technology. Jack Ma doesn’t believe that blockchain is a rich source of desired money that can be exploited for a long time and help someone build a fortune. But Jack Ma believes that blockchain technology can be used to solve some of the toughest problems that the world is currently facing. Some of these problems include certainty, data, privacy, and security solutions. The model that makes tech giants Google and Facebook billions of dollars each and every year is selling of users’ data. This can be evidenced by the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s scandal . Jack Ma and Alibaba as a whole seem to have been doing more research concerning blockchain technology; they’ve become the largest holders of blockchain patents after researching and learning more about the potential benefits of the technology, apart from just, trading and buying and selling of blockchains. Other high profile people who don’t believe in bitcoin but potentially believe in blockchain technology include Warren Buffett, chair of Berkshire Hathaway and the third richest person in the world according to Forbes magazine . In an interview with Yahoo Finance , Warren Buffett said that; “If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t have anything that is producing anything …you’re just hoping the next guy pays more. And you only feel you’ll find the next guy to pay more if he thinks he’s going to find someone that’s going to pay more”. He added, “You aren’t investing when you do that, you’re speculating”. Bill Gates said that investing in Bitcoin produces nothing, so it cannot be expected to appreciate. Chalie Munger, vice chairman for Berkshire Hathaway said that “Bitcoin is worthless artificial gold”. And he and (the Berkshire Hathaway team) could own more Apple shares instead of investing in bitcoin. While high profile people like Warren and Gates despise Bitcoin, others like Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton, Dan Morehead, Tim Draper, and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss relentlessly believe in Bitcoin. They strongly believe that they will make a fortune off cryptocurrency.

The hard fork happened following the controversy over the integration of SegWit feature with Bitcoin’s blockchain.\nA host of forks have since followed — christened by adding any random word you can imagine next to Bitcoin: Candy , Pizza , God , Faith , Diamond , Gold , Atom , etc.\nMost of the forked cryptocurrencies, however, don’t seem to have had any luck when it comes to adoption or trading volumes.\nAs per Coinmarketcap data, only four of the forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private) see trading volumes of more than $100,000 per 24 hours.\nBitcoin’s software is open-sourced, and a hard fork happens when a developer clones the Bitcoin’s blockchain to make a new blockchain and cryptocurrency by modifying the original code.\nIdeally, the purpose of a hard fork is to make technical advancements in the existing blockchain, when some people still want to keep using the consensus protocol of the older blockchain.\nBut it seems that most of the hard forks are only aimed at minting quick money using Bitcoin’s name rather than bringing any significant advancements in blockchain technology.\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab,” George Kimionis, CEO of Coinomi told Bloomberg at the beginning of this year predicting that 2018 will see the launch of at least 50 Bitcoin hard forks. “Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases — rather than honest attempts to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem.”\nWith services such as Forkgen , which allow even rookie programmers to create Bitcoin hard forks, it is likely that the number will end up being a lot higher.\nLet’s see what names they’ll come up with — I am rooting for Bitcoin Butter Chicken Masala.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,370 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must hold the $8,240 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses.\nBitcoin price is trading above a major support at $8,240 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD should stay above the 100 hourly SMA to trim recent losses. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter trading towards the $8,600 level, bitcoin price faced a selling interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a short-term top at $8,596 and started a downside move. The price declined and moved below the $8,400 support level. More importantly, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high.\nIt opened the doors for more losses, resulting in a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair almost tested the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high. However, the price is currently holding the 100 hourly simple moving average and $8,280. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at $8,400, followed by the all-important $8,600. As long as the price is above the 100 hourly SMA, it could make an attempt to surpass the $8,400 level. On the other hand, a close below the 100 hourly SMA may perhaps push the price back towards $8,150.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $8,240. However, BTC buyers must clear the $8,400 hurdle for a push towards $8,600.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving higher towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,240 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:02:14.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e8d1ef1dde82c0534ea97ad9788955fee911d54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac19QhV.wiUxOInyrcjsKkZ7dcuSxuASyrXeUacWPeTrc2EC5RQU.vc1PWxYwBSacA", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Get Free Bitcoin Bitcoin On This This Bitcoin Mining Website", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoin Bitcoin On This This Bitcoin Mining Website - Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e8d1ef1dde82c0534ea97ad9788955fee911d54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac19QhV.wiUxOInyrcjsKkZ7dcuSxuASyrXeUacWPeTrc2EC5RQU.vc1PWxYwBSacA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ausmond", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoin Bitcoin On This This Bitcoin Mining Website", "text": "Hi there, you can get free bitcoin on this bitcoin mining site for free without paying anything at the first stage you can check things out for yourself use this link\nhttps://www.autobtcminer.com/20808517", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.autobtcminer.com/20808517"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:33:29.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91d19af4abd6850fdd43b2d91c84a136b0742432", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT9bJqqt4hHyjJM_On3pVLJhKQLg9Gm59AmWQPeJjeYwy5CYO3LxMlDFyPqWUUURq2U4kH1P2Pvv9HoKKOwa.Rvv5GwXELNnwtbR_yIYFIJc31mCK82snljHPVkrWMUxsBSw0iOcygPd1iUScI0PKwroOszopAguQk-", "site_full": "cryptotelegraph.co", "site": "cryptotelegraph.co", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Exec of $5.1 Trln Investment Firm Makes Tired Comparison of Crypto to Tulips - Cryptocurrency News - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Exec of $5.1 Trln Investment Firm Makes Tired Comparison of Crypto to Tulips - Cryptocurrency News - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cryptotelegraph.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80NTdkMzYyZGYxMmZmOGQ4NDBmYzA3ZGU4NTVjZDNiMy5qcGc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91d19af4abd6850fdd43b2d91c84a136b0742432", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT9bJqqt4hHyjJM_On3pVLJhKQLg9Gm59AmWQPeJjeYwy5CYO3LxMlDFyPqWUUURq2U4kH1P2Pvv9HoKKOwa.Rvv5GwXELNnwtbR_yIYFIJc31mCK82snljHPVkrWMUxsBSw0iOcygPd1iUScI0PKwroOszopAguQk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Exec of $5.1 Trln Investment Firm Makes Tired Comparison of Crypto to Tulips - Cryptocurrency News - Bitcoin News", "text": "Exec of $5.1 Trln Investment Firm Makes Tired Comparison of Crypto to Tulips By 0 1\nAn executive at Vanguard Investment has made the by now trite comparison of cryptocurrencies to tulips, while also noting his appreciation for blockchain tech. The global chief economist of a major investment firm has criticized cryptocurrencies in an op-ed on investment fund news site ETF.com published yesterday, May 21.\nJoe Davis, the global chief economist and global head of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, stated that while blockchain technology shows promise, the rise of cryptocurrencies can be compared to the Netherlands’ 17th century “tulip mania,” a classic example of a bubble market.\nDavis, whose firm manages a reported $5.1 trillion in assets globally as of this January, began the piece by remarking on his enthusiasm for blockchain technology – which he notes Vanguard uses – but adds that:\n“As for bitcoin [sic] the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nDavis then makes the arguably misleading comparison between cryptocurrency and 17th century Holland’s craze for tulips, pointing out the cryptocurrencies, “unlike tulips, […] don’t look very nice in a vase.”\nAccording to Davis, it is debatable whether cryptocurrencies are really currencies, since – according to him – they can be considered a unit of account and a medium exchange, but not a store of value:\n“Even if cryptocurrencies qualify for niche purposes, their prospects seem dubious.”\nDavis then writes that since cryptocurrencies create no cash flow or dividends, have prices based on speculation, are not connected to the value of blockchain technology, and make crypto investors lower their investments in traditional markets, “the investment case for bitcoin is hardly compelling,” continuing:\n“Bitcoin is an investment in blockchain in the same way that Pets.com was an investment in the internet.”\nIn the fall of last year, Nasdaq wrote a piece on the five reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) was nothing like the tulip mania, writing that the growth of the leading cryptocurrency is “not a bubble.”\nIn fact, the breadth of the tulip mania itself has apparently been over exaggerated, with researcher Anne Goldgar writing in her book on the subject that “there weren’t that many people involved and the economic repercussions were pretty minor.”\nAfter Wall Street mogul Warren Buffett also came out strongly against Bitcoin earlier this month, referring to it as “rat poison squared,” Cointelegraph published an Expert Take on why Wall Street will be left behind if it fails to invest in the promise of new technologies like blockchain.

The fund development could aid the rise of the cryptocurrency’ s value. He continued: “That’s how blockchains gain value. You’re going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash.” After the price surge to $1600 on May 5, BCH subsequently declined to the 50-day SMA and formed a head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $650. Over the last 24 hours, BCH has lost almost 5.8 percent in price, from $1290 to $1205. Still it is valued significantly higher than its April level of $760.

Today I will proffer two more: censorship and propaganda were allowed to run rampant; miners didn’t understand their power and responsibility. Last Friday, Coingeek.com held a fantastic conference in Hong Kong on the topic of blockchain commerce. The conference concluded with a panel discussion featuring 3 of the most well-known thought leaders in the Bitcoin Cash community: Roger Ver, Dr. Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu. Each of them said something important that pertains to these topics.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3 Bitcoin Cash Avoiding Censorship Censorship is an obvious barrier to an educated community and is motivated by a desire to control the narrative. Thus, it goes hand-in-hand with propaganda and the active promotion of mis information. In Hong Kong, Roger shared that his biggest mistake was underestimating how effective censorship can be. He explained why: while established community members can easily dismiss misinformation, newcomers cannot. And since the community is a fast-growing one, the misinformed newcomers become a majority. You can read more about the history of censorship in Bitcoin here. Mindful Miners In a recent “AMA” , former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn pointed out that historically, BTC miners haven’t been rational economic actors. He said they’ve been incapable of disobeying the authority of the devs. But we may be turning the corner on this. At the Coingeek conference, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu expressed that the miners have learned from previous mistakes, and are starting to take more responsibility for understanding the protocol and making intelligent decisions. In the past, miners have followed Bitcoin Core almost unconditionally — perhaps overly fearful of “breaking” the network should their guidance not be followed to the letter. While its sensible to consult experts for their opinions, Bitcoin is not on the same order of complexity as nuclear engineering. (Incidentally, nuclear engineering has been the very metaphor used to incorrectly suggest that the community should abandon independent thinking and blindly follow developers). Bitcoin is an Economic System One of the thematic ideas presented by Dr. Wright in Hong Kong (and in previous talks) is that Bitcoin is NOT a cryptographic system. It’s an economic system that happens to use cryptography. This is the kind of revelation that’s obvious after you hear it expressed so succinctly. In my own words, it means that Bitcoin’s economic incentives are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work. The cryptography is secondary to that. The economics are the “what” and the cryptography is the “how”. If you investigate one of Bitcoin’s predecessors, Wei Dai’s b-money , you may be surprised at how similar it is to Bitcoin. The one major element that’s missing is the set of economic incentives. Miners, Users, and the Public Discourse Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship. Users don’t have a network without miners, and miners don’t have economic incentive without users. In theory, miners are rewarded by providing the network that users want. But what if the miners don’t know what users want because the public discussion is being censored and brigaded with propaganda? What if they’re listening to the devs instead of the users, or they simply don’t understand enough about Bitcoin to make good choices? Unfortunately, miners can participate in the system and earn rewards for securing the network without understanding anything about Bitcoin. But its quite dangerous for miners to be ignorant because they’re the ones directly responsible for making the bottom line decisions about consensus rules. It’s therefore really encouraging to hear that miners are much more educated and involved than they were several years ago. The Role of Developers In the (flawed) Bitcoin Core paradigm, Bitcoin developers were the wizards and rulers. They handed down the proclamations from their ivory towers for the users and miners to follow. If you didn’t like it, you were told you could “fork off”, even as those developers denied they wielded influence over the protocol. In the actual economic model of Bitcoin, miners set the consensus rules with the ultimate consent of the users who give economic value to the system. Developers, although important, serve a tertiary role and are not directly part of the incentive model. Development Funding If developer groups need to compete (as we discussed in a previous article), then the obvious question is “what incentivizes that competition?” In the past, this has been a conundrum. How can we make sure there’s enough development resources and talent in a free, open-source software project? Yet, if we look honestly at the incentive model of Bitcoin, the answer is clear: it’s ultimately the miners’ responsibility to pay for the software they are going to run. Maybe that means mining pools directly sponsor development teams (which seems to be something that’s been irrationally shamed or presented as a conflict of interest) …Or maybe it means miners should formulate some kind of system to donate a portion of the block rewards to protocol advancement, as was proposed in a recent strategy meeting . Conclusion Bitcoin Cash is on the right track and will stay on the right track by following these 5 principles: Knowledge and education must be valued and promoted. Understanding Bitcoin is not the exclusive realm of wizards. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer to peer electronic cash. Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. We can disagree on many things as long as we agree on this. We must never allow censorship, because we know propaganda and misinformation are sure to quickly follow. There needs to be multiple independent teams of developers and multiple protocol implementations. No one group should have control of the protocol. The mining community must be engaged, informed, and willing to make logical decisions that align with their own economic interests.\nWhat are your thoughts on educating the BCH community?

Insider", "text": "By Samantha Hurst\nUK-based blockchain company nChain announced on Tuesday it closed deal terms to acquire a majority stake in HandCash, a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet that uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. According to nChain, the deal was made through nChain Group’s investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nnChain reported that HandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through “contactless” means once users’ mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality). HandCash co-founder, Alex Agut, stated :\n“Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. That’s why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.”\nnChain Group CEO, Jimmy Nguyen, also commented :\n“For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.”\nnChain added the deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network.

The bitcoin price dipped below $8,300 and the value of Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, dropped to $690. Main Factors Behind the Cryptocurrency Market Slump\nThe recent correction of the cryptocurrency market and the short-term decline in the price of bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies and tokens can be mainly attributed to three major factors: Bitfinex taxation policy, scandal of South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb, and the initial sell-off of the Mt. Gox trustee’s bitcoin funds.\nAs CCN reported on May 17, Bitfinex requested a portion of its users to forfeit their tax IDs and social security numbers. Bitfinex is a company that is headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, with another office in Taiwan. BVI does not have a taxation policy for cryptocurrency investors and its favorable regulation attracted many of the biggest businesses in the cryptocurrency sector such as Bitfinex and large-scale initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nHowever, the pressure from major economies and governments like the US could have a negative impact on the British Virgin Islands if the US decides to directly engage with the government of BVI to crackdown on US-based investors using Bitfinex to buy and sell cryptocurrencies to avoid taxes.\nThe Bitfinex team said last week:\n“The government of the BVI may then exchange information with the tax authorities of the customer’s country of residence, consistent with the British Virgin Islands law, the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Common Reporting Standard (CRS).”\nMajor cryptocurrency trading groups including Whalepool publicly stated that it will stop using Bitfinex until its taxation policy changes and encouraged others to do the same.\nThe sell-off by large-scale investors on Bitfinex, which still remains as the biggest bitcoin-to-USD exchange, was one of the major factors that contributed to the slump of the cryptocurrency market throughout the past week.\nThe South Korean cryptocurrency market has only started to recover from the UPbit and Bithumb scandal as of recent, upon the release of the official audit report of leading accounting firm Yoojin that confirmed the funds of UPbit identically matched its balance sheet.\nThe cryptocurrency market will likely recover from the Bitfinex situation relatively soon and it is a matter of time before the large-scale investors that have withdrawn from Bitfinex utilize other exchanges and over-the-counter markets to re-enter.\nIf investors in the South Korean cryptocurrency market regain trust in local exchanges and the global market recovers from the Bitfinex case, it is highly likely that the cryptocurrency market rallies and regains momentum. Short-Term\nIn the short-term, it remains uncertain whether the bitcoin price manages to stay above the $8,200 resistance level and refrains another drop below the $7,000 region or records a corrective rally back to the $8,800 to re-enter the $9,000 region. Either results are possible, based on the movement of the bitcoin price and its volume in the upcoming days.\nClick here for a real-time bitcoin price chart and here for ethereum prices.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bithumb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:45:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ea3dcd8db8232ec959ec883158026a5da631460", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWUnnBHyUA8rIwwmLpbcHrlUCP_oEOxo6PfQM3hECVNJFFRZKyKAwucmjZnEvlIt8cFb03HpnclM99JrpY2bWt", "site_full": "bitsonline.com", "site": "bitsonline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "TradingView Secures $37 Million in Funding - Inside Bitcoins - News, Price, Events", "title_full": "TradingView Secures $37 Million in Funding - Inside Bitcoins - News, Price, Events", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ea3dcd8db8232ec959ec883158026a5da631460", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWUnnBHyUA8rIwwmLpbcHrlUCP_oEOxo6PfQM3hECVNJFFRZKyKAwucmjZnEvlIt8cFb03HpnclM99JrpY2bWt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Marinoff", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "TradingView Secures $37 Million in Funding - Inside Bitcoins - News, Price, Events", "text": "This story was shared from this site\nTradingView.com – a web service providing data analysis tools and social networking capabilities for traders – has raised nearly $40 million USD in new venture funding thanks to last year’s cryptocurrency boom. The platform provides charts and graphs that offer insights into the ups-and-downs of cryptocurrencies and stocks.\nJoin the Bitsonline Telegram channel to get the latest Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and tech news updates: https://t.me/bitsonline\nHow Does It Work?\nTradingView provides JavaScript-based programming known as Pine Script that allows users to develop their own customized financial tools. Monthly plans begin at $15, and go up to $30 or $60 depending on the program. In addition, the company also allows customers to exchange trading tips and tricks for free, but charges if they want to access additional charts, graphs, and alerts.\nSince March of this year, the company has garnered approximately eight million more users, and has witnessed over 61 percent more traffic. The platform has also begun offering its services for free to partner websites like Nasdaq, Bitfinex, and Seeking Alpha.\nThe funding is being led by New York-based growth stage investment firm Insight Venture Partners. Thus far, the company has managed to secure roughly $37 million in initial capital.\nWhat Prompted the Site’s Exponential Growth?\nVice-president of Insight Venture Partners Paul Szurek says the boom in cryptocurrency interest in late 2017 ultimately led to the company becoming more centered on digital assets:\n“The rise of cryptocurrencies and trading those assets has fly-wheeled into a broader interest in investing across asset classes. From October to January, during the real core of the crypto boom, there were a lot of users coming in and starting research on that asset class… 80 percent move on to research other asset classes. As TradingView.com kind of pushed through the [first quarter], trends in growth really diverged from what we were seeing in purely crypto-focused business, and that’s a testament to users leveraging this one-stop shop component of the platform.”\nTradingView Ramping Up The Fans\nThe company has also managed to secure funding from firms like DRW Venture Capital and Jump Capital. DRW head Kimberly Trautmann later stated:\n“TradingView.com was built for non-professional traders, but its accessible trading tools and powerful, yet intuitive charting capabilities have attracted the attention of institutional investors. We are excited about the diverse cross-section of the industry that TradingView.com has reached and its rapid growth. As a propriety trading firm on an institutional level, we’re looking forward to leveraging the platform and contributing to its further development.”\nTradingView was founded in 2011 and went through TechStars Chicago in 2013 to secure $3.7 million during its primary years from companies like Irish Angels and iTech Capital. Just as more institutional investment companies are becoming interested in cryptocurrencies , TradingView’s social networking element has crypto enthusiasts more interested in financial markets.\nDo you ever use the charts and graphs on TradingView.com?

Mining them is 60 per cent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n\"Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,\" said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. \"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 per cent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 per cent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: \"no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you're still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant US fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list. People involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=As", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/as-bitcoin-world-wobbles-mining-rig-company-plans-2-billion-ipo/articleshow/64269125.cms&title=As"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T09:53:28.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e06a74d3e20306bd5b497b7874d747663717ab8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2wVwv1GOz6Msy5xK737ZFABw8Ekw2S.t5sWsmdlgeKcSRFP4zPc2NAYX5XXFxo0fSI0_Q7_S3Jl6PBN.wsWXCuNp5F0cEz_9tCDcWWMmV527E1hX1DRStJdk2Pbf_LKjx7lSIgtwNXHJA_thAhI1v", "site_full": "www.bloomberg.com", "site": "bloomberg.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza - Bloomberg", "title_full": "This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza - Bloomberg", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixdiFnWzz2AQ/v0/1200x800.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 356, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 549, "comments": 0, "shares": 549}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e06a74d3e20306bd5b497b7874d747663717ab8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2wVwv1GOz6Msy5xK737ZFABw8Ekw2S.t5sWsmdlgeKcSRFP4zPc2NAYX5XXFxo0fSI0_Q7_S3Jl6PBN.wsWXCuNp5F0cEz_9tCDcWWMmV527E1hX1DRStJdk2Pbf_LKjx7lSIgtwNXHJA_thAhI1v", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Camila Russo", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza - Bloomberg", "text": "Cryptocurrency enthusiasts everywhere set aside May 22 to celebrate the anniversary of the first ever Bitcoin transaction: Two pizzas for 10,000 coins bought exactly eight years ago. If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many Bitcoins today, they’d rise to outer space.\nAt today’s price near $8,200 per Bitcoin, you could get about 6.5 million $12.50 pizzas. If you stacked those pizza boxes, they’d climb almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) into the air, according to data from Forex Time, a foreign exchange broker. Its animated infographic marks the landmarks crossed by the boxes -- Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, Mount Everest, a passenger airplane -- before shooting into space. Bitcoin isn’t quite getting to the moon, but close.\nAs Bitcoin’s value soared over the years, the developer who made the initial purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz, became a legend in the crypto space and beyond. He’ll forever be known as the guy who forked over assets now valued at $82 million, for pizza. Earlier this year Hanyecz replicated his move using the Lightning Network, a technology that runs parallel to Bitcoin’s blockchain and aims to speed up transactions.\nBitcoin Pizza Day has become a reminder of how much the coin’s price has skyrocketed even after the slump from the record of almost $20,000 last year.
