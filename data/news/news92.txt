Being the first currency to utilize blockchain technology, and remaining that way for some years has led to it gaining a solid foothold in the market in terms of users and overall value and market share. This has not remained a constant however, as the development of the first public Alternatives to Bitcoins or “Altcoins” in 2011 has given buyers other options from what was a limiting framework and non-liquid currency in Bitcoin. With the advent of Altcoins such as DasCoin entering the public market in the years leading to the present, Bitcoin has slowly relinquished the front stage, relegating itself to a placeholder role, wherein it remains as a non-liquid but value-stable cryptocurrency. However, it is undeniable that it is becoming impractical to use it as a day-to-day payment method, which is where Altcoins come in. The Potential Of Altcoins & DasCoin Cryptocurrency has seen a general upward trend in value, as any product in its early years with a growing user base will tend to do. But a growing userbase isn’t the only determinant of success and value in this industry. In a world where the very framework of Cryptocurrencies is based off of cutting edge technology, innovation and development drives value and popularity as much as anything. It is here where Altcoins such as DasCoin shine, as they are situated in the beneficial position of garnering the advantages of the existing foundations of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, but also being able to develop their own unique features, and adjust the existing framework to adapt to the needs of the cryptocurrency market. It is this flexibility that lends Altcoins a bright future in the industry, and also gives an insight into the possibility that Bitcoin’s position at the top could be a precarious one. Cryptocurrencies: Looking Forward With the significant scope of analysis and interpretation that goes into the monitoring of trends in the cryptocurrency industry, predicting its future is not as complex as one might think. But past the numbers and the upward trends, one must take into account variables that cannot be quantified. Going forward, the people who use blockchain technology will be looking towards efficiency, stability, transparency, and security when searching for the ideal cryptocurrency option, and as innovation drives the development of Altcoins forward, there is a distinct possibility that Bitcoin may lag behind. While it is far from a foregone conclusion that Bitcoin will no longer be a key player in the industry, it may not be so unlikely to imagine Altcoins taking center stage, as options such as DasCoin lead cryptocurrencies in customer satisfaction and trust, and continue to place the user at the center of its ethos, delivering that high standard through the implementation of intuitive frameworks and innovative use of blockchain technology. In conclusion, a clear case could be made for the marked rise of Altcoins in comparison to that of Bitcoin, such that it may come to a point where Altcoins are no longer the alternative to Bitcoin, but the preferred option.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/5-years-ago-you-should-have-bought-bitcoin-not-altcoins/", "http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2018/02/dascoin-hard-facts-about-the-currency-of-trust/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "potential of altcoins & dascoin cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T03:40:15.122+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a86f14c3caffa6d220ec0fa004cc2a0507dc8066", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__35vSvVIpbi1BNGm6QcpT3PqEAnpPdE_gELDuqzX5N0ndxsvZk3K1NDEaM2RAWYzakw--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Bitcoin Is the Traditional Market’s New ‘Fear Gauge,’ Says Market Maker", "title_full": "Bitcoin Is the Traditional Market’s New ‘Fear Gauge,’ Says Market Maker", "published": "2018-05-30T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a86f14c3caffa6d220ec0fa004cc2a0507dc8066", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__35vSvVIpbi1BNGm6QcpT3PqEAnpPdE_gELDuqzX5N0ndxsvZk3K1NDEaM2RAWYzakw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Is the Traditional Market’s New ‘Fear Gauge,’ Says Market Maker", "text": "Home » bitcoin » bitcoinist » crypto » news » Bitcoin Is the Traditional Market’s New ‘Fear Gauge,’ Says Market Maker Bitcoin Is the Traditional Market’s New ‘Fear Gauge,’ Says Market Maker bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nAs credit risk increases and traditional investors look to safeguard their money, one market maker believes Bitcoin may be a more reliable “fear gauge” than the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). ‘Storing Their Money Under Their Pillow’\nAccording to Equity Armor Investment’s Brian Stutland, the future movement of financial markets may be best predicted by monitoring Bitcoin. The market maker and regular CNBC contributor told the network’s post-market show Fast Money yesterday that “Bitcoin is sort of becoming the new VIX, in sort of getting ahead of credit risk in the banking industry.”\nVIX, which stands for the CBOE Volatility Index, is a popular and trusted measurement of both volatility and fear in the traditional financial market. It utilizes S&P 500 stock options prices and is often referred to as the stock market’s “fear gauge.”\nStutland, however, thinks Bitcoin might be better than the VIX. He explained:\nThere is huge correlation right now between VIX and bitcoin 30 days ago, 30 trading days ago, that is starting to measure out credit risk in the market. That’s what cryptocurrency is becoming. It’s becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.\nStutland bases his assessment on the fact that the Bitcoin and greater cryptocurrency market is still unregulated and allows for the open and easy transfer of capital, noting:\nBitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets. Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.\nStutland also made note of the fact that increased credit from banks facilitates caution on the part of investors, claiming:\nAs credit risk increases we get more volatility in the market.\nAs noted by CNBC, the VIX reached highs of 18.39 yesterday, up from lows of 12.59 on Friday.\nTuesday was decidedly bearish for all three major indexes, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping almost 500 points at its lowest.\nOn the flip side, the Bitcoin market saw a bounceback from what had been a brutally bearish downtrend. The market leader is currently trading, at the time of this writing, at $7,520.49, up 5.42 percent over the last 24 hours.\nWhen Bitcoin moves, altcoins follow. Many major market players in the cryptocurrency space saw healthy gains yesterday, with Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS , Stellar, Cardano, IOTA, and TRON all up between 10 and 20 percent over the last 24 hours.\nDo you think Bitcoin is a better indicator of fear in the marketplace than the CBOE Volatility Index?

Analysts forecast doom if $6900 gives way\nBTC/USD stuck around $7000 - Tuesday was a green day for most major cryptocurrencies as the value of the largest digital coin by market cap kept the industry steady. That being said it was hardly anything to get excited over, as to say the bulls were struggling to extend meaningful gains is probably extremely generous. A 1% move in Bitcoin can happen in seconds, so being $200 away from a crucial support level is definitely not much comfort to bulls who have seen a relentless low volume grind eating into their positions. Perhaps a little bit of risk-off helped Bitcoin on Tuesday, but given how all over the place risk correlations have been, this is not easy to quantify and BTC is definitely not a consensus-haven asset yet. Risks of a drop to $5K increase\nA quick glance at the charts is enough to tell you things have not gone well this year for Bitcoin. A longer look at you might start to think it is approaching the precipice. Omkar Godbole, a technical analyst for Coindesk, is of the opinion that the $6900 level is not one that bulls should take likely as he does not skip on the hyperbole of where the next leg down could be going if things get off track from this point as he writes,\n“The losses signal a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900 – a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost. If they can't, prices may go as low as $5,000.”\nIn order to get out of imminent danger, a substantial rally is now in need. Mr. Godbole articulates that at least $500 of gains in price would be needed to get off this immediate cliff, and beyond that, nearly $2000 to flip the script and put the bullish narrative back in the offing,\n“A minor corrective rally to $7,300 could be in the offing, but will likely be short-lived. A break above the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,702 would abort the bearish view. Only a convincing move above $9,990 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.”\nPersistently low volumes refuse to abate and it is clearly worrying the marketplace. With no specific reason to point to, a crackdown on illicit dealing is a major worry as it could suggest that without those murky capital inflows, BTC lacks the magic it once had.

In the under 35-Year-old, it was almost every Second. The survey also sheds light on how many Germans have actually crypto-currencies.\nThe Postbank commissioned a study to learn more about who is willing to invest in crypto-currencies – or, at least, who think about it. Overall, the Postbank respondents 3.100 Federal citizens, a number that is valid according to the Postbank as a “representative of the population”.\nThe result: in Total, every third German Cryptocurrencies keeps for an interesting money system, the under-35-Year-old, it was every Second. The reasons for this is the independence of the monetary policy of the Central banks, the prospect of high yields and with crypto-currencies related to anonymity. For every five prospects emotional reasons such as thrill and the “gold digger-Feeling were also” to invest in a relatively new, digital form of investment.\nDr. Thomas lack as Chief Digital Officer, Chief Digital Officer of the Postbank finds this remarkable:\n“It is noteworthy that the German interest in crypto-currencies as a financial investment, despite the high exchange rate losses, and Revelator risk is still great. Here is a real danger that people will lose money, just because you follow a Hype is with security.“\nOf the respondents, every fifth German citizens also stated that with crypto-currencies good or very good to know about. However, the rule still concern. So 56 percent of the respondents say that the risk was too high, while half recognises that you are familiar with crypto-currencies is too little. Almost 30 percent of the respondents had to be currencies, concerns about the technology: Crypto “purely virtual”, you also have a fear of hackers. Also lack of control and protection of the potential investors to stop investing: a 30 percent stated that they were withholding the missing deposits, the protection of an investment, while 29 per cent complained of the lack of state control. Digital Natives have more Cryptocurrencies than the average\nThe study also showed that it is mainly young people, the crypto-currencies:\n“With six per cent, the so-called ‘Digital Natives’ currencies ‘ twice as often Cryptographic as the average of the total population. In the next twelve months, a further 14 per cent of the 18 to – to 34-Year-old crypto-currencies. Across all age groups, this is only eight percent.“\nConclusion: Because what is to come.

With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. One of the busiest metros in Europe, over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway daily.\nThe company published an update on its website where it provides a detailed description of the location of each ATM. The new machines were installed in Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka and Hlavní Nádraží.\nAccording to Coinatmradar.com , the Czech Republic now has 46 bitcoin ATMs, with 34 of these ATMs concentrated in Prague. Of the 3,138 bitcoin ATMs manufactured globally, GENERAL BYTES has now manufactured 27.63 percent, with their machines installed in every major city in the world . Their ATMs support the purchase and sale of bitcoin, litecoin, dash and monero.\nIn conversation with Bitcoin Magazine , Martijn Wismeijer, Marketing Manager of GENERAL BYTES, described his company as \"veterans in the blockchain space who have been there from the very beginning.” He pointed out that the company was “the first to introduce sending cryptos via email” as well as the creator of the first BATMOne models.\nWismeijer said his company offers \"seven different cryptocurrency ATM models as well as a point-of-sale (POS) called CortexPay.” These crypto ATM models are all based on a similar code base; however, he also explained that, even though the machines were similar in code base, there are some minor differences in the hardware design and a range of additional features. These features include the capacity of the acceptor, dispenser and recycler combinations as well as the acceptance of multi-currencies on a single machine.\nThe ATM models are called the BATM series ATM. BATM is the name of the platform created by GENERAL BYTES for producing the ATMs. These machines are further divided into the BATMTwo series (one-way and two-way options) and the BATMThree series ATMs.\nAccording to Wismeijer, the one-way BATMTwo series ATMs were chosen for this project as there are already many two-way ATM locations in and around the city. “Installing the one-way BATMTwo models allows GENERAL BYTES to showcase the possibilities that abound for clients brand-wise with the optional BATMStand which transforms the machines into a free-standing unit.”\nWismeijer explained that clients can either run and maintain their servers or they can use the company’s cloud-hosted server, which allows operators to run their software on GENERAL BYTES’ server for a small fee.\nCryptocurrencies in Prague Prague has been a growing hotspot for everything crypto for a while now.\nThere hasn't been much definition or regulation of virtual currencies in the Czech Republic, and the government is seen to be somewhat friendly to cryptos.\nThe subject matter is, however, being discussed in government circles as the Czech National Bank published a paper titled \"Don't be Afraid of Bitcoin,\" where it declared that \"Prague is home to a strong community of cryptocurrency users,\" while playing down the potential threats of cryptocurrency to the traditional monetary system.\nLast year, Alza became the \"first large European retailer\" to add cryptocurrency payments to its website and install two bitcoin ATMs in its showroom locations in Prague and Bratislava.\nThe hip and trendy Holešovice district in Prague is also home to the famous Cryptoanarchy Institute, Paralelni Polis , an organization that educates the public on cryptocurrencies. Prague is also home to a couple of crypto startups like SatoshiLabs (makers of Trezor hardware wallets).\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nRead Article Full Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs : https://ift.tt/2kBQuUF", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martijn wismeijer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hlavní nádraží", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skalka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague metro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "můstek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejvická", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nádraží veleslavín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zličín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankrác", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:44:33.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bfd6a2405830d2e783ae5e14c59605eaedd9034", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vz2c0KktOOahFBi3TAO.RetIw49NOH0Qgp.VDU1lsMEC1BQEnMoSeYT6RSRiEvkv8LoYgzCCuNXq1ySPIdtF4lE", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "First Bitcoin 1-Day Trading Volume Reaches $80.00 (CRYPTO:BIT)", "title_full": "First Bitcoin 1-Day Trading Volume Reaches $80.00 (CRYPTO:BIT)", "published": "2018-05-30T19:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1323.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bfd6a2405830d2e783ae5e14c59605eaedd9034", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vz2c0KktOOahFBi3TAO.RetIw49NOH0Qgp.VDU1lsMEC1BQEnMoSeYT6RSRiEvkv8LoYgzCCuNXq1ySPIdtF4lE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sebastian Weber", "published": "2018-05-30T19:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin 1-Day Trading Volume Reaches $80.00 (CRYPTO:BIT)", "text": "Posted by Sebastian Weber on May 30th, 2018 // No Comments\nFirst Bitcoin (CURRENCY:BIT) traded 20.9% higher against the dollar during the 1-day period ending at 6:00 AM Eastern on May 14th.

With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. One of the busiest metros in Europe, over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway daily.\nThe company published an update on its website where it provides a detailed description of the location of each ATM. The new machines were installed in Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka and Hlavní Nádraží.\nAccording to Coinatmradar.com , the Czech Republic now has 46 bitcoin ATMs, with 34 of these ATMs concentrated in Prague. Of the 3,138 bitcoin ATMs manufactured globally, GENERAL BYTES has now manufactured 27.63 percent, with their machines installed in every major city in the world . Their ATMs support the purchase and sale of bitcoin, litecoin, dash and monero.\nIn conversation with Bitcoin Magazine , Martijn Wismeijer, Marketing Manager of GENERAL BYTES, described his company as \"veterans in the blockchain space who have been there from the very beginning.” He pointed out that the company was “the first to introduce sending cryptos via email” as well as the creator of the first BATMOne models.\nWismeijer said his company offers \"seven different cryptocurrency ATM models as well as a point-of-sale (POS) called CortexPay.” These crypto ATM models are all based on a similar code base; however, he also explained that, even though the machines were similar in code base, there are some minor differences in the hardware design and a range of additional features. These features include the capacity of the acceptor, dispenser and recycler combinations as well as the acceptance of multi-currencies on a single machine.\nThe ATM models are called the BATM series ATM. BATM is the name of the platform created by GENERAL BYTES for producing the ATMs. These machines are further divided into the BATMTwo series (one-way and two-way options) and the BATMThree series ATMs.\nAccording to Wismeijer, the one-way BATMTwo series ATMs were chosen for this project as there are already many two-way ATM locations in and around the city. “Installing the one-way BATMTwo models allows GENERAL BYTES to showcase the possibilities that abound for clients brand-wise with the optional BATMStand which transforms the machines into a free-standing unit.”\nWismeijer explained that clients can either run and maintain their servers or they can use the company’s cloud-hosted server, which allows operators to run their software on GENERAL BYTES’ server for a small fee. Cryptocurrencies in Prague\nPrague has been a growing hotspot for everything crypto for a while now.\nThere hasn't been much definition or regulation of virtual currencies in the Czech Republic, and the government is seen to be somewhat friendly to cryptos.\nThe subject matter is, however, being discussed in government circles as the Czech National Bank published a paper titled \"Don't be Afraid of Bitcoin,\" where it declared that \"Prague is home to a strong community of cryptocurrency users,\" while playing down the potential threats of cryptocurrency to the traditional monetary system.\nLast year, Alza became the \"first large European retailer\" to add cryptocurrency payments to its website and install two bitcoin ATMs in its showroom locations in Prague and Bratislava.\nThe hip and trendy Holešovice district in Prague is also home to the famous Cryptoanarchy Institute, Paralelni Polis , an organization that educates the public on cryptocurrencies. Prague is also home to a couple of crypto startups like SatoshiLabs (makers of Trezor hardware wallets).\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinatmradar.com/manufacturer/5/general-bytes-bitcoin-atm-producer/", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://coinatmradar.com/charts/", "https://satoshilabs.com/", "https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/o-nas/en/", "https://www.generalbytes.com/bitcoins-at-alza/", "https://services.generalbytes.com/cs/", "https://www.lidovky.cz/nejvytizenejsi-stanici-je-i-p-pavlova-d88-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A081212_164914_ln_praha_hel", "https://coinatmradar.com/country/57/bitcoin-atm-czech-republic/", "https://www.cnb.cz/en/public/media_service/interviews/media_2017/cl_17_170731_hampl_omfif.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hlavní nádraží", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skalka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prague metro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "můstek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejvická", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nádraží veleslavín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zličín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankrác", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T23:04:57.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22f7ab65dbcb49e6e83efe3fc675f1a6d7992e70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.spf0Ds1HvtsJLA6fn_IVCmdI_KjzH9W5uS9Lu3fjOHTUVu9c4N3wuzUMcBS83CKJpQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7325.21", "title_full": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7325.21", "published": "2018-05-30T19:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22f7ab65dbcb49e6e83efe3fc675f1a6d7992e70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.spf0Ds1HvtsJLA6fn_IVCmdI_KjzH9W5uS9Lu3fjOHTUVu9c4N3wuzUMcBS83CKJpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Bitcoiner (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T19:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7325.21", "text": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7325.21\nMay 30, 2018 at 08:59AM\n7325.21 Bitcoin Price ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T19:04:33.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9888b1e7b0a536a200d91cd5f17a2bfe7406fece", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiTWEjR4Lfs0SkoCc.qz4tU1aGHgm4H0BbyjGRsmpSZNvRkx3ooQGEYTjGF9riODu.XdX5jGBHx6QxFSH6fYXK8Tp3QssvWCRK68REts.1KvqK_lw1XUXR222oHQegMa3PE2BS.f0RIJC", "site_full": "www.freedomsphoenix.com", "site": "freedomsphoenix.com", "site_section": "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/RSS/News-Feed.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Freedom's Phoenix Newsletter Headlines", "title": "Bitcoin Gets Sexy: Goodbye Pasty Neckbeards, Hello Vin Armani", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gets Sexy: Goodbye Pasty Neckbeards, Hello Vin Armani", "published": "2018-05-30T19:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Uploads/Graphics/693-0530090318-Vin-Armani.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9888b1e7b0a536a200d91cd5f17a2bfe7406fece", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiTWEjR4Lfs0SkoCc.qz4tU1aGHgm4H0BbyjGRsmpSZNvRkx3ooQGEYTjGF9riODu.XdX5jGBHx6QxFSH6fYXK8Tp3QssvWCRK68REts.1KvqK_lw1XUXR222oHQegMa3PE2BS.f0RIJC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T19:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gets Sexy: Goodbye Pasty Neckbeards, Hello Vin Armani", "text": "05-30-2018 • https://news.bitcoin.com\nBitcoin cash is beginning to shed its inner nerd, and Vin Armani is one of the leading reasons.

With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. One of the busiest metros in Europe, over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway daily.\nThe company published an update on its website where it provides a detailed description of the location of each ATM. The new machines were installed in Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka and Hlavní Nádraží.\nAccording to Coinatmradar.com , the Czech Republic now has 46 bitcoin ATMs, with 34 of these ATMs concentrated in Prague. Of the 3,138 bitcoin ATMs manufactured globally, GENERAL BYTES has now manufactured 27.63 percent, with their machines installed in every major city in the world . Their ATMs support the purchase and sale of bitcoin, litecoin, dash and monero.\nIn conversation with Bitcoin Magazine , Martijn Wismeijer, Marketing Manager of GENERAL BYTES, described his company as \"veterans in the blockchain space who have been there from the very beginning.\" He pointed out that the company was \"the first to introduce sending cryptos via email\" as well as the creator of the first BATMOne models.\nWismeijer said his company offers \"seven different cryptocurrency ATM models as well as a point-of-sale (POS) called CortexPay.\" These crypto ATM models are all based on a similar code base; however, he also explained that, even though the machines were similar in code base, there are some minor differences in the hardware design and a range of additional features. These features include the capacity of the acceptor, dispenser and recycler combinations as well as the acceptance of multi-currencies on a single machine.\nThe ATM models are called the BATM series ATM. BATM is the name of the platform created by GENERAL BYTES for producing the ATMs. These machines are further divided into the BATMTwo series (one-way and two-way options) and the BATMThree series ATMs.\nAccording to Wismeijer, the one-way BATMTwo series ATMs were chosen for this project as there are already many two-way ATM locations in and around the city. \"Installing the one-way BATMTwo models allows GENERAL BYTES to showcase the possibilities that abound for clients brand-wise with the optional BATMStand which transforms the machines into a free-standing unit.\"\nWismeijer explained that clients can either run and maintain their servers or they can use the company's cloud-hosted server, which allows operators to run their software on GENERAL BYTES' server for a small fee.\nCryptocurrencies in Prague Prague has been a growing hotspot for everything crypto for a while now.\nThere hasn't been much definition or regulation of virtual currencies in the Czech Republic, and the government is seen to be somewhat friendly to cryptos.\nThe subject matter is, however, being discussed in government circles as the Czech National Bank published a paper titled \"Don't be Afraid of Bitcoin,\" where it declared that \"Prague is home to a strong community of cryptocurrency users,\" while playing down the potential threats of cryptocurrency to the traditional monetary system.\nLast year, Alza became the \"first large European retailer\" to add cryptocurrency payments to its website and install two bitcoin ATMs in its showroom locations in Prague and Bratislava.\nThe hip and trendy Holešovice district in Prague is also home to the famous Cryptoanarchy Institute, Paralelni Polis , an organization that educates the public on cryptocurrencies. Prague is also home to a couple of crypto startups like SatoshiLabs (makers of Trezor hardware wallets).\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martijn wismeijer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hlavní nádraží", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skalka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague metro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "můstek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejvická", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nádraží veleslavín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zličín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankrác", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:44:47.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8113317d7aa8f6b959831cc3160728ed969381f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg85DavK9o.qlXDosTuUQk_oH.UqIFpYXBuFNjVeqa1DfzyXox5RiAk.Ub5qf3oFWKsDTdm_53cTYEW31F8S13mFvye_S7btUPc-", "site_full": "www.usabeststocks.com", "site": "usabeststocks.com", "site_section": "http://www.usabeststocks.com/stocks/top-stocks/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Top Stocsks – Top Stocks For 2018", "title": "Are Traders Manipulating the Price of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Are Traders Manipulating the Price of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-30T18:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8113317d7aa8f6b959831cc3160728ed969381f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg85DavK9o.qlXDosTuUQk_oH.UqIFpYXBuFNjVeqa1DfzyXox5RiAk.Ub5qf3oFWKsDTdm_53cTYEW31F8S13mFvye_S7btUPc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-30T18:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are Traders Manipulating the Price of Bitcoin?", "text": " Are Traders Manipulating the Price of Bitcoin? Leave a reply\nIn 2017, the cryptocurrency market simply couldn’t be stopped. In just a 12-month period, the combined value of all virtual currencies added together rose from $17.7 billion to roughly $613 billion a gain of more than 3,300%. By comparison, it would have taken the stock market decades to generate the returns that virtual coins dished out in just one year.\nWait, bitcoin can go down in value?\nHowever, 2018 has been a completely different story. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, shed more than half of its value in just a one-month span toward the beginning of the year, and it’s struggled to recover ever since.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhat’s behind bitcoin’s struggles, you ask? Part of the blame can be assigned to a step-up in regulation. Investors tend to appreciate the anonymity and unregulated nature of virtual currencies. However, in South Korea, a market that’s critical to the success of bitcoin and digital currencies in general, new laws in place require banks to verify the identity of their members before linking their bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. This newfound transparency likely goes a long way to validating bitcoin as an asset, but it’s not been viewed as a positive by some within the crypto community.\nBitcoin’s woes may also be partially blamed on what I refer to as the proof-of-concept conundrum associated with blockchain technology. Blockchain — the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies most cryptocurrencies and is responsible for logging all data in a secure and unchanging manner — has proven its worth in numerous small-scale projects, but has yet to catch on in the real world. Until businesses are willing to give this technology a shot, and blockchain can demonstrate its ability to scale, it’ll remain constrained.\nMore recently, though, legal concerns have held back bitcoin.\nAre traders manipulating the price of bitcoin?\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it was opening up a criminal probe into whether cryptocurrency traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and Ethereum for financial gain. The DOJ will be working side by side with the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which currently handles all derivatives trading tied to bitcoin.\nThe DOJ believes that bitcoin is susceptible to fraud for a number of reasons, as listed by Bloomberg. In particular, regulators question whether cryptocurrency exchanges have adequate measures in place to actively pursue those folks who attempt to cheat the system. They also point to the wild volatility in digital currencies as a lure for cheaters who are looking to manipulate the system. Lastly, the aforementioned lack of regulations could make it considerably easier for traders to move virtual coins like bitcoin.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, regulators are looking into two specific types of manipulation: spoofing and wash-sale trades.\nSpoofing involves a trader, or group of traders, placing an order that creates a new best bid or adds to the perceived liquidity of an asset. Shortly thereafter, the trader(s) will then cancel their initial bid (the spoof) and place a trade on the opposite side of the market. This is done so a trader can sell their stake in an asset, but at an improved sales price thanks to their spoofed bid, which may have offered the perception of downside liquidity and/or support and encouraged other traders to bid up the price of an asset. The same can be done in reverse, with spoofed asks, ultimately allowing the trader(s) to net a more attractive purchase price on an asset.\nOn the other hand, a wash-sale would involve an individual, or group of traders, buying and selling an asset with themselves in the hope of pushing its price higher and giving off the perception of improved liquidity.\nGiven how little regulation surrounds most decentralized crypto exchanges, spoofing and wash-sale trades may very well both be occurring, but we won’t have any confirmation on that until the DOJ’s investigation wraps up, which could take some time.\nYet another reason to avoid bitcoin\nIt’s become pretty evident as time has passed that bitcoin, while being an incredible creator of wealth over the past couple of years, is rife with risk. In addition to potentially being manipulated by cryptocurrency traders, bitcoin’s network has slowed to a crawl, relative to its peers.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAccording to an analysis of transaction speed per second conducted by HowMuch.net, bitcoin peaks at a meager seven transactions per second. By comparison, leading global payments processor Visa can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second using its existing infrastructure.\nBitcoin’s block-processing time of approximately 10 minutes also tends to be substantially longer than its peers, resulting in an average validation and settlement time of 78 minutes. Sure, this is still quicker than sending funds across borders using traditional banking networks, but it’s substantially slower than practically all of its peers. Though the Lightning Network is supposed to resolve bitcoin’s scaling issues, the damage may already be done.\nWhat damage you ask? We’ve witnessed a small handful of merchants moving away from bitcoin as a medium of exchange due to its slow network. Payment processor Stripe, which was the very first major company to accept bitcoin in 2014, dropped bitcoin as a payment method last month.\nAnd, just to round things out, there aren’t any traditional fundamental metrics with which to value bitcoin. Unlike a stock, which has income statements, balance sheets, earnings reports, and management commentary that can be scoured, bitcoin offers nothing more than transaction speed and average daily transaction count, which tell us absolutely nothing about its long-term staying power.\nAs amazing as the gains have been, the writing appears to be on the wall to avoid bitcoin. by admin .

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg .\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines and was down 3% to $7,409. It’s down more than 20% since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street. Traders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading ( Market Rigging ) — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining, include Bitcoin and Ether.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy. But Bitcoin’s meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams. Cryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions. 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe?utm_source=Mondato+Newsletter&utm_campaign=0e655e7ca4-Mobile+Credit%3A+Airtime%2C+Mobile+Money&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b4cb05c7b7-0e655e7ca4-2889", "https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13358Z:US", "https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/4131761Z:US"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:46:44.059+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce7bf79e7faf91fbb5ed2037045b07d6cc899c5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfI08aGgDDr__.qhf55XNyI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses", "title_full": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses", "published": "2018-05-30T18:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce7bf79e7faf91fbb5ed2037045b07d6cc899c5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfI08aGgDDr__.qhf55XNyI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "blizzard31", "published": "2018-05-30T18:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses", "text": "according to the news at CNBC here is why:\nthe coin has seen better days.

Source: Quartz.com Financial Crisis 2.0 - Great For Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ( COIN ) moved up by about 4% on Tuesday as fears over the next financial crisis spread like wildfire across multiple continents. Have you seen what Italian bonds are doing? They’re essentially melting. Italy’s 2-year just skyrocketed by about 900% from a low of .276% on Monday to 2.74% on Tuesday. Source: Coinmarketcap.com Source: Investing.com I guess this is what happens when “the people with pitchforks” get closer to power, investors panic. Why do they panic? Because when the people take power, the status quo will get altered, and a financial crisis of epic proportions will likely ensue. So, how is any of this beneficial for Bitcoin? Essentially, Bitcoin represents a legitimate alternative to the status quo, and the current predominant fiat-based monetary system. This system could very possibly experience a significant crash as the people with pitchforks come to power in Europe. In this case, Bitcoin should attract enormous interest and significant capital inflows as the paradigm shift towards the “new world” medium of exchange and store of value system accelerates. What Is Going On In Europe? First, I want to point out that it’s not just rates, just about all the banks in Europe are getting crushed as well today. Perhaps most notably, one of Europe’s most prominent and infamous institutions, Deutsche Bank ( DB ) is down by about 7% Tuesday. And America is not immune from this selloff as U.S. banks struggle as well. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) is down by around 4% Tuesday. DB data by YCharts Why The Selloff? Essentially, the seeds to the next finical crisis are being sown right now in Europe. And no, central banks are not magicians, they can’t simply solve every significant financial problem. The best they can do is attempt to postpone the issues, and time of their unrivaled influence may be coming to an end. At the time of writing this article, Italy’s largest lender UniCredito ( OTCPK:UNCRY ) is down by 11% on the session, and Finecobank ( OTC:FCBBF ), another big lender in Italy is down by 15%. It appears that investors are quite concerned about the populist movements’ growing popularity and influence in Europe. And right now, ground zero for the battle of the Eurozone is in Italy. Rome In Chaos The populist parties that represent the interests of “the people” are becoming much more influential in Europe. And the people of Italy, as well as many individuals in European nations don’t want to be controlled by a central authority in Brussels. Source: Listtop10s.com In fact, Italy was set to appoint a populist finance minister Paolo Savona, a man who in his book called the adoption of the Euro a “historic error.” However, in an unprecedented political move Italy’s president vetoed the appointment, outraging populist parties that hold a majority in Italy’s parliament, and creating enormous chaos and discord in Rome. Following Brexit’s Lead If you think it was bad when Brexit happened, it’s going to be 10 times worse if a country like Italy exits the EU or ditches the Euro. The difference of course is that while England has continuously enjoyed its own currency, Italy has used the Euro for many years now. Therefore, if a populist government takes power in Italy, and by some indications it appears it will, Italy may very well drop the Euro. The domino effect could be catastrophic and will likely lead to enormous sovereign debt defaults across the entire continent and possibly around the world. After all, Italy’s biggest banks are not down by 10-15% today because their earnings were bad. No, they’re down because they own a significant amount of Italy’s debt. This debt will almost certainly be worth pennies on the dollar if Italy ditches the Euro or exits the EU. It’s not a farfetched argument that something along the lines of a “Lehman moment” could ensue after that. So, Where Does Bitcoin Come In In All This? Well, if you recall, Bitcoin was essentially created as an answer to the financial crisis of 2008. Whereas the traditional financial system seemingly failed due to its complex structure, financial engineering, extreme manipulation, and rampant greed, Bitcoin was created to decouple a payment processing and store of value system from these detrimental financial elements. And we know that for the most part it worked. Source: QZ.com Bitcoin can’t be over-printed or manipulated. There are no sovereign bonds associated with Bitcoin, no mortgage-backed securities, no credit default swaps, no quadrillion in global derivatives, etc. Bitcoin is largely independent of the current fiat system - it’s simple, there is a finite number that can ever be created, and perhaps most importantly it is not controlled by a decaying corrupt central body. Let’s face it, the current fiat financial system is a train wreck waiting to happen. Whether it’s a dollar crisis due to blowout U.S. deficits, and a continuously swelling national debt, a sovereign debt crisis due to a collapse of the Eurozone, a credit crisis due to record levels of debt all around the world, a financial debacle in China, or some other financial disaster, the traditional financial system will experience an enormous shock once again. Everything is interconnected, and one major crisis can wipe out the life savings of millions of people around the globe in the blink of an eye. So, what is the alternative, how do we get off this train seemingly headed towards the edge of a cliff? Of course, the solution is Bitcoin. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general represent a perfect alternative to the current monetary system as they can easily perform most off the functions the fiat monetary system accomplishes. But they can handle medium of exchange and store of wealth functions better, cheaper, faster, more efficiently, and most importantly without the risk of inflation, manipulation, or confiscation from the hands of a corrupt central authority. The Bottom Line As the financial crisis 2.0 approaches and even more so when it arrives, Bitcoin should begin to experience much greater interest. People will likely begin to look at Bitcoin as the future of payment processing, and store of value. More and more people around the globe will start converting to Bitcoin because it is largely immune from many of the inherent risks attributable to the current fiat system. People using Bitcoin don’t need to worry about possible bank collapses, currency devaluation, runaway inflation, central bank manipulation, etc. And once the people with pitchforks come to power in Italy and in other areas around the globe, we can expect to see increased financial and currency crises as “the people” will likely vote to exit the EU (much like the scenario we witnessed in England). However, this time the Euro currency will suffer significantly, and the dollar will also suffer due to the U.S.’s burgeoning, out of control debt burden. These crises should compel people to adopt Bitcoin and other alternative currencies, which will result in much higher popularity and significantly higher prices for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. At its core, Bitcoin is a relatively simple phenomenon that can take over the functions of the current fiat system in areas of payment processing and store of value, minus the significant risks pertaining to the current system. Moreover, Bitcoin is in the mainstream now, millions of people worldwide recognize its capabilities, and the numbers are increasing continuously. Therefore, I expect Bitcoin to continue much higher as future financial crises materialize.

The recent bearish pressure in Bitcoin which led the price to reside below $8,000 is viewed as the impact of the investigation of the US Department of Justice for which certain market participants left the market. Though the investigation is still going on as the DOJ is still searching for transaction practices and if there is any crime related to it. Despite recent bad fundamentals, more investors like Boerse, owner of Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is looking forward to offer crypto currency investment products. Such positive fundamental is expected to attract more investors and market participants to the market.\nAs for the current scenario, the price is expected to push higher towards $8,000 area in the coming days but with certain corrections and volatility.

SHARE ON: Babatunde — May 30, 2018\nThe idea of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is relatively a new one in today’s world. But this should not come as a surprise since we are in a tech age or era where innovation is thriving.\nSo, Bitcoin is an innovation that cannot be overlooked or sidelined when talking about finance or legal tenders. It must be counted as one because many organisations and individuals now see it as a means of exchange for good and services. As well as a means of payment\nAs the Bitcoin craze spreads globally, governments of different countries have strongly advised against investing in cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the nations that have not given this directive have evolved different policies to regulate Bitcoin.\nTruth be told, you cannot blame the government for being sceptical or concerned about Bitcoin. This is because bitcoin transactions are difficult to track and can provide acceptable levels of privacy when used correctly-you know anything that is not fully under the control of the government always concerns or worries them.\nIn other cases, criminal-minded elements have used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to commit various crimes which the security agencies find difficult to resolve. Additionally, the Bitcoin price fluctuation is another reason because it may be $10,000 today and fall to $1,000 tomorrow.\nThis is why in Asian countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan, using or trading in virtual currencies is highly illegal and comes with harsh punishments.\nRegardless of the race to regulate Bitcoin, the government cannot stop it from making a headway. This is due to the fact that it has become a worldwide phenomenon that any form of regulation will probably fail.\nPresently, people buy bitcoin as a form of investment and it has made many of them billionaires.\nThis is not to say that no sort of control should be implemented but the government must not regulate it like they do with the paper currency. Why? Anyone who has the knowledge can actually mine a bitcoin.\nThe only advice or admonition any government can give persons who want to invest in bitcoin is to understand everything about Bitcoin before they put there in it. They can use a Bitcoin wallet like Paxful which is safe and secured for their transactions. After this, there is nothing to worry about.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "babatunde", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T00:45:42.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9118a21b077085bb6f1716cdde7655dbee5c25a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSa88_wXt1DNlfFrbaJ.41Ey6o_oklTmrXXs8LkWNrHD7hEJ_roPj50IRmweHDEGOcJE0u8a7Y.wy", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Fun fact, in 2017 we experienced the largest percentage increase in price during a bubble in bitcoins history, yet volatility was historically low.

In theory, it was an ideal currency as it promised fast transaction times, low processing fees and anonymity for the two parties involved in the transaction.\nIn reality, however, things weren’t always so smooth. By mid-2017, the transaction times touched record highs due to a congested network that couldn’t handle the extra volume of transactions. More to that, transactions costs also rose sharply as a result of this. Sponsored Links What Was the Alternative?\nThere were severe scalability issues with the Bitcoin network, and a movement began in the community to find an alternative to solve these issues. August 2017 saw a Bitcoin hard fork, with Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic being the resulting digital currencies to spawn from this move, with the latter being short-lived. Bitcoin ($BTC) will always be king!Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) is to compliment Bitcoin.And run along side it, by acting as an express lane for core values, speed and privacy.We are the cool cousin thats a good wingman.unlike the other one hating, and trying to steal ur girl. pic.twitter.com/ZP9z1jWbKF\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 29, 2018\nIt has now been revealed, however, that a team of developers continued to work on this chain and it has now been rebranded to Bitcoin Core (BTCC). This name is set to confuse the masses as the team identified the project with the most popular Bitcoin software client that 94 percent of Bitcoin users utilize.\nOn the BTCC website, they claim to be the true embodiment of “Satoshi’s vision,” a similar claim which is made by Bitcoin Cash. It is currently traded on the Bisq and Crypto Bridge exchanges, with the price being volatile but hovering around the $10 level.\n— CryptoBridge (@CryptoBridge) May 28, 2018 Trolling Ver?\nThere are commentators in the space who believe that the idea of BTCC is to troll Roger Ver as opposed to putting forward what would be a viable fork.\nAll of this similar terminology is sure to confuse investors and developers alike as people are calling the same thing by different names. It is an active war within the overarching Bitcoin community and is not one that looks to be solved any time soon.

Top Cryptocoin Experts believe that Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) is looking for the $1107.92 goal. According to 2 analysts could reach $2485.38. The highest price was $1029.53 and lowest of $878.39 for May 29-30. The open was $885.73. It last traded at Bitfinex exchange. Aproximately 112,830 BCH worth $109.89 million was traded.\nFor a month, Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) tokens went down -25.30% from $1348.27 for coin. For 100 days BCH is down -33.82% from $1521.92. It traded at $1325.56 200 days ago. Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) has 17.16M coins mined with the market cap $17.28B. It has 21.00M coins in circulation. It was founded on 01/08/2017. The Crypto BCH has PoW proof type and operates under SHA256 algorithm.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard forked version of the original Bitcoin. It is similar to bitcoin with regards to its protocol; Proof of Work SHA-256 hashing, 21,000,000 supply, same block times and reward system. However two main differences are the the blocksize limits, as of August 2017 Bitcoin has a 1MB blocksize limit whereas BCH proposes 8MB blocks. Also BCH will adjust the difficulty every 6 blocks as opposed to 2016 blocks as with Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Cash is a proposal from the viaBTC mining pool and the Bitmain mining group to carry out a UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork) on August 1st 12:20 pm UTC. They rejected the agreed consensus (aka BIP-91 or SegWit2x) and have decided to fork the original Bitcoin blockchain and create this new version called “Bitcoin Cash”. Bitcoin Cash can be claimed by BTC owners who have their private keys or store their Bitcoins on a service that will split BCH for the customer.\nhttps://blockchair.com/\n Winifred Garcia ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchair.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garcia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:10:39.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d89589ff9d4df0d5fed37fab238f4cbe6a1bdbac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaLVAJZF4RPRZRxDbGyI5C5ZtNy2OQA2X1VnSJJLxWicpJlAe5n4R3mp9jbshOLuGGLP9Vx0tL8BeczwAec53X8g--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "Analysis of the latest Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News by The Crypto Lark", "title_full": "Analysis of the latest Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News by The Crypto Lark : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-30T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d89589ff9d4df0d5fed37fab238f4cbe6a1bdbac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaLVAJZF4RPRZRxDbGyI5C5ZtNy2OQA2X1VnSJJLxWicpJlAe5n4R3mp9jbshOLuGGLP9Vx0tL8BeczwAec53X8g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dannage888", "published": "2018-05-30T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analysis of the latest Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News by The Crypto Lark", "text": "submitted by /u/Dannage888\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptovideos.tv/trending-news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-news-eos-bugs-titanium-finished-icos-for-koreans-and-zimbabwe/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:23:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f87ff65d6cf63f744ca44444d3015d9bea7ad847", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYEUmtnIoAUsaM4T9Kpv0Uc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What does bitcoin need to improve?", "title_full": "What does bitcoin need to improve?", "published": "2018-05-30T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f87ff65d6cf63f744ca44444d3015d9bea7ad847", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYEUmtnIoAUsaM4T9Kpv0Uc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "troglobait", "published": "2018-05-30T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "What does bitcoin need to improve?", "text": "I do not believe that Staoshi is one person.

However, analysts and traders usually wait for confirmation â positive follow-through before calling a reversal.\nSo, a short-term bullish trend reversal would be confirmed if bitcoin takes out the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing manner. Currently, the 10-day MA is located at $7,562 and is capping the upside in prices, as seen in the chart above.\nMagic Number? Chart Data Hints at June 6 Bitcoin Boost\nMeanwhile, the 50-candle MA hurdle in the 4-hour chart below is also proving a tough nut to crack.\n4-hour chart A high volume break above the 50-candle MA of $7,520 could see bitcoin attack the descending trendline hurdle, currently located at $7,930.\nThat said, prices will likely revisit $7,100 if bulls are unable to cross the key moving average hurdle in the next few hours.\nThe chart also shows the major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south, a lingering bearish setup. So, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA will be easierÂ said than done.\nView The immediate outlook has been neutralized, but only a convincing move above the 10-day MA of $7,562 would add credence to yesterday's bullish outside-day candle and signal a short-term bullish reversal. In such a case, BTC will likely test the descending trendline hurdle, now seen at $7,930.

Bitcoin used $7,120 as a support while the bulls were eyeing $7,600. At the moment, BTC/USD is trading a bullish flag pattern pending another upside breakout.\nIt is still unclear what caused the sudden upsurge in Bitcoin on Tuesday 29, however, one of FXSTREET writers, Yohay Elam believes that there is a connection between the political discord in Italy. ‘Italexit’ might have been the boost that took Bitcoin from trading $7,120 to above $7,500. The elections in March resulted in an economic crisis in the country. Italy’s stock prices have plummeted almost similar to the Brexit situation in Great Britain. The money flowing out of Italy’s bonds, the Euro as well as the global stocks could have ended up in the crypto market . Elam Yohay wrote referring to the crisis in Italy, “When the establishment is in crisis, alternatives are sought after.”\nHowever, at the time of writing, Bitcoin price is supported at $7,500. There is a bullish trend in progress which could test $7,600 again. There are a couple of other support areas at $7,440 and $7,400 respectively. The MACD is slightly in the positive region, moreover the Stochastic is above the 70 mark showing that the bulls still have the momentum to push for higher corrections.\nBTC/USD 15’ chart\n(Click to enlarge) Ethereum price is up 1.44 percent on the day, although it is facing immediate resistance at $580. Besides, applying the Fibonacci levels shows that the area around $580 is a major hurdle towards $600.\nA report in the market says that more than 1,000 decentralized applications have been developed and launched on Ethereum network. This comes after the ‘ConsenSys Community Day’ that took place in Tel Aviv earlier in the week. The event is organized in support of the Ethereum blockchain. Speaking at the conference, Christian Crowley, an analyst from Alethio a company specializing in Ethereum blockchain said that the network has reached 29.2 million addresses that are unique. Moreover, there are more than 100,000 new users on Ethereum network on average daily.\nAt the moment, Ethereum price is trading between the moving averages support and resistance. The 50 SMA is preventing gains to the upside, while the 100 SMA is supporting the price close to $560 (23.6 percent Fib retracement level). ETH/USD has formed a bullish flag pattern but is still at risk of downward movements. A stronger support, is, however, expected at $520 but $500 will be an overstretch for Ethereum. The Stochastic on the 1-hour chart is moving upwards toward 50 signaling that the buyers still have the momentum to attack $580.\nETH/USD 1-hour chart\n(Click to enlarge)\nRipple, the third largest coin by market value, is changing hands at $0.6160, amid quiet trading session.

However, analysts and traders usually wait for confirmation â positive follow-through before calling a reversal.\nSo, a short-term bullish trend reversal would be confirmed if bitcoin takes out the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing manner.

So, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA will be easierÂ said than done.\nView The immediate outlook has been neutralized, but only a convincing move above the 10-day MA of $7,562 would add credence to yesterday's bullish outside-day candle and signal a short-term bullish reversal.

The overall bias remains bearish as long as the falling trendline hurdle remains intact Repeated rejection at the 50-candle MA resistance in 4-hour chart could yield a pullback to $7,100â$7,000. A break below $6,900 would open up downside towards $5,000, while a move above the recent high of $9,990 would revive the long-run bullish outlook.

If they can’t, prices may go as low as $5,000,” according to CoinDesk.\nThe all-time high for bitcoin is around $20,000, which was seen in December 2017.

Believers from Beijing to Buenos Aires see the potential for a financial system free from banks and governments. More than just a tech industry fad, Bitcoin has threatened to decentralize some of society’s most basic institutions.An unusual tale of group invention, Digital Gold charts the rise of the Bitcoin technology through the eyes of the movement’s colorful central characters, including an Argentinian millionaire, a Chinese entrepreneur, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Already, Bitcoin has led to untold riches for some, and prison terms for others.

Investing in Bitcoin in the hope of taking advantage of future price increases is as simple as buying Bitcoin on an online exchange. When the price increases, it means that we get profit.

Manipulating the Price of Bitcoin?", "text": " 1 hour ago Are Traders Manipulating the Price of Bitcoin?\nIn 2017, the cryptocurrency market simply couldn't be stopped. In just a 12-month period, the combined value of all virtual currencies added together rose from $17.7 billion to roughly $613 billion – a gain of more than 3,300%. By comparison, it would have taken the stock market decades to generate the returns that virtual coins dished out in just one year. Wait, bitcoin can go down in value?\nHowever, 2018 has been <> a completely different story . Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, shed more than half of its value in just a one-month span toward the beginning of the year, and it's struggled to recover ever since.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhat's behind bitcoin's struggles, you ask? Part of the blame can be assigned to a step-up in regulation. Investors tend to appreciate the anonymity and unregulated nature of virtual currencies. However, in South Korea, a market that's critical to the success of bitcoin and digital currencies in general, <> new laws in place require banks to verify the identity of their members before linking their bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. This newfound transparency likely goes a long way to validating bitcoin as an asset, but it's not been viewed as a positive by some within the crypto community.\nBitcoin's woes may also be partially blamed on what I refer to as the proof-of-concept conundrum associated with <> blockchain technology . Blockchain -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies most cryptocurrencies and is responsible for logging all data in a secure and unchanging manner -- has proven its worth in numerous small-scale projects, but has yet to catch on in the real world. Until businesses are willing to give this technology a shot, and blockchain can demonstrate its ability to scale, it'll remain constrained.\nMore recently, though, legal concerns have held back bitcoin. Are traders manipulating the price of bitcoin?\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it was opening up a criminal probe into whether cryptocurrency traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and Ethereum for financial gain. The DOJ will be working side by side with the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which currently handles all derivatives trading tied to bitcoin.\nThe DOJ believes that bitcoin is susceptible to fraud for a number of reasons, as <> listed by Bloomberg . In particular, regulators question whether cryptocurrency exchanges have adequate measures in place to actively pursue those folks who attempt to cheat the system. They also point to the wild volatility in digital currencies as a lure for cheaters who are looking to manipulate the system. Lastly, the aforementioned lack of regulations could make it considerably easier for traders to move virtual coins like bitcoin.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, regulators are looking into two specific types of manipulation: spoofing and wash-sale trades.\nSpoofing involves a trader, or group of traders, placing an order that creates a new best bid or adds to the perceived liquidity of an asset. Shortly thereafter, the trader(s) will then cancel their initial bid (the spoof) and place a trade on the opposite side of the market. This is done so a trader can sell their stake in an asset, but at an improved sales price thanks to their spoofed bid, which may have offered the perception of downside liquidity and/or support and encouraged other traders to bid up the price of an asset. The same can be done in reverse, with spoofed asks, ultimately allowing the trader(s) to net a more attractive purchase price on an asset.\nOn the other hand, a wash-sale would involve an individual, or group of traders, buying and selling an asset with themselves in the hope of pushing its price higher and giving off the perception of improved liquidity.\nGiven how little regulation surrounds most decentralized crypto exchanges, spoofing and wash-sale trades may very well both be occurring, but we won't have any confirmation on that until the DOJ's investigation wraps up, which could take some time. Yet another reason to avoid bitcoin\nIt's become pretty evident as time has passed that bitcoin, while being an incredible creator of wealth over the past couple of years, is rife with risk. In addition to potentially being manipulated by cryptocurrency traders, bitcoin's network <> has slowed to a crawl , relative to its peers.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAccording to an analysis of transaction speed per second conducted by HowMuch.net, bitcoin peaks at a meager seven transactions per second. By comparison, leading global payments processor Visa can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second using its existing infrastructure.\nBitcoin's block-processing time of approximately 10 minutes also tends to be substantially longer than its peers, resulting in an average validation and settlement time of 78 minutes. Sure, this is still quicker than sending funds across borders using traditional banking networks, but it's substantially slower than practically all of its peers. Though the Lightning Network is supposed to resolve bitcoin's scaling issues, the damage may already be done.\nWhat damage you ask? We've witnessed a small handful of merchants moving away from bitcoin as a medium of exchange due to its slow network. Payment processor Stripe, which was the very first major company to accept bitcoin in 2014, dropped bitcoin as a payment method last month.\nAnd, just to round things out, there aren't any traditional fundamental metrics with which to value bitcoin. Unlike a stock, which has income statements, balance sheets, earnings reports, and management commentary that can be scoured, bitcoin offers nothing more than transaction speed and average daily transaction count, which tell us absolutely nothing about its long-term staying power.\nAs amazing as the gains have been, the writing appears to be on the wall to avoid bitcoin.\nBitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you now Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled ten investing directly in Bitcoin was noticeably absent from their recommendations! better buys.\n<> Learn more\n{% render_component 'sa-returns-as-of' type='rg'%}\n<> Sean Williams has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

A recently conducted research goes on to show the depths of this concerns and concludes that a billion-dollar cryptocurrency network could be brought down with a few million dollars, and a little technical work.\nAlgorithms Tremendously Exposed As per a blog post on May 22, 2018, Brazilian cryptocurrency researcher Husam Abboud demonstrated the fatal exposure of Ethereum Classic's (ETC) blockchain algorithm to a 51 percent attack . Abboud estimated that a 51 percent attack could be conducted by an enterprising miner for as little as $1.5 million. A 51 percent attack allows the aggressor to 'double spend,' which could potentially cause havoc for exchanges.\nThe startling findings go on to show that simulations suggest an amount of $55 million could bankrupt the world's 17th largest digital currency (by market cap ). In return, the attacker could obtain a $1 billion profit by short selling ETC with 35x margin, assuming a price drop of 50 percent.\nAs stated, the protocol's proof-of-work algorithm – same as Bitcoin and Ethereum – is inherently vulnerable to network attacks, which can effectively put an entire network in jeopardy with minimal resources, as there are no barriers to entry regarding capital costs.\nAbboud said:\n\"Any miner who contributes as little as 2.5 percent of Ethereum Nethash can simply switch to mining Ethereum Classic and control more than 51 percent of hashing power of Ethereum Classic network.\"\nFor purposes of his research, Abboud deployed a Rindex v2.0 model , moving away from the traditional model for calculating the costs of a 51 percent attack, which include the costs of acquiring mining equipment and electricity. However, the Rindex focuses only on hashpower leasing, ignoring the redundant equipment costs for PoW blockchains.\nSeveral Cryptocurrencies Face 51 Percent Attack Threat Abboud used the same model to calculate the costs for executing a similar attack on other cryptocurrency blockchains. The researcher calculated an amount of $2 million for performing a network attack on Bitcoin Cash , the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency valued at $16 billion, and a paltry $300,000 for Bitcoin Gold , a Bitcoin hard fork with a value of $750 million.\nThe estimate for the cost of a 51 percent attack on Monero is suggested to be inflated, as Nvidia GTC 1080 mining cards are not as powerful as Vega mining cards. Once taken into account, it would make Monero the fifth most expensive blockchain network to attack and cuts the cost of 51 percent attack by two thirds, according to one Monero subreddit user.\nCost of launching network attacks on major cryptocurrencies. Source: Medium\nIn theory, the attacks are present as long as the core developers of the victim blockchain deploy a patch, or as long as the attacks remain profitable for the attacker to continue.\nThe researcher states that Bitcoin 's creator did not consider a 51 percent as a major threat while developing the protocol, as it would ultimately lead to a lower market value for the digital currency, making it highly unprofitable and disadvantageous for them.\nHowever, the launch of bitcoin futures and margin trading has created an environment where traders can profit from short-selling the plunging market, making this assumption false.\nAbboud noted:\n\"We have major exchanges with a lot of liquidity which allow you to short-sell with a trading margin from 2.2 to up to 100 times. It's just becoming easier everyday and the market is more liquid for opportunities where you can benefit from price decline.\"\nCrypto51 Highlights Theoretical Costs of an Attack A website known as Crypto51 has also emerged, which highlights the theoretical cost of a 51 percent attack on each network. The data shows that the one-hour attack cost for Bytecoin is $981 despite the altcoin having a market cap exceeding one billion.\nMoreover, Bitcoin Private has a similar figure for the one-hour attack cost, but with the coin not present on many exchanges and the lack of options to short the altcoin, the only incentive to attack coins like these would be \"malice\" according to Jackson Palmer, a former Dogecoin developer.\nSource: Crypto51\nThe NiceHash-able column shows how much computing power could be rented from NiceHash to conduct such an attack. So for a cryptocurrency with 100 percent or more in the NiceHash-able column, the capital costs of a 51 percent attack are eliminated as the hashrate needed can be entirely rented out.\nBitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr reckons that 51 percent attacks are feasible for altcoins like bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, and maybe even bitcoin if \"Bitmain wanted to\":\nPSA: if someone has a full >50% hashrate for your cryptocurrency, there is NO NUMBER of blocks where confirmation is safe. Once you get beyond 50%, you can reverse an unlimited number of blocks!\n(What happened to BGold, CAN be done to BCH or maybe Bitcoin if Bitmain wants to…)\n— Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) May 25, 2018\nWhile attacks on some cryptocurrencies seem trivial regarding finance, it is the technical know how that is the biggest obstacle to translating these theoretical attacks into actual double spends on these blockchains.\nSticking with the Heavyweights The recent findings highlight how index-tracking the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization could become devastating, given that Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Litecoin are the most robust and hardest to attack, while others in the top ten, 15, or 20 are relatively easier to attack.\nA takeaway from these results for investors is to stick with coins that are dominant for their respective hashing algorithms; i.e., bitcoin for SHA-256, Ethereum for ETHhash, and Litecoin for Scrypt.\nA possible solution for such concerns – which are only stipulated to grow as the networks increase – is to introduce newer consensus protocols to blockchains, primarily moving wholly away from a PoW consensus to other types, such as proof-of-stake.\nVarious suggestions have been buoyed, ranging from increasing the number of required confirmations, upgrading the hashing algorithms to make the networks ASIC-resistant, and sharding.\nA Blitz Against Low-security Blockchains Incoming? But with 51 percent attacks emerging on networks like Bitcoin Gold and Verge , many commentators believe it is just a matter of time before the weaker cryptocurrencies are exposed to attack. It could be the case that hackers are just testing the waters and will gear up toward more lucrative attacks on larger cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhile attacking a cryptocurrency network in of itself is not illegal, shorting the said crypto and conducting a 51 percent attack is, which may deter some attackers.\nInterestingly, after cryptocurrency markets were overstretched regarding valuation during early 2018, the rest of the year could well see attacks on smaller cryptocurrencies and weed out the good from the bad.\nContributions by Jamie Holmes.\nThe post Research: Smaller Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Private are Trivial to 51 Percent Attack appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abboud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "husam abboud", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "etc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:45:01.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d691bc1d91b426e6bde03ad29e46c8444f3f367", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR4tWXVWLCe1hYW9PSYifboBnYfP2sJ0.DsyhFNGqkQS2XB1a3g0NLgy79f0H1u3OwJuXWbgC3aJ6HfN4bW00VSRbTpajWjxR_A--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "LocalBitcoinCash.org Launch Of Peer To Peer Online Shopping With Bitcoin Cash", "title_full": "LocalBitcoinCash.org Launch Of Peer To Peer Online Shopping With Bitcoin Cash : btc", "published": "2018-05-30T17:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d691bc1d91b426e6bde03ad29e46c8444f3f367", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR4tWXVWLCe1hYW9PSYifboBnYfP2sJ0.DsyhFNGqkQS2XB1a3g0NLgy79f0H1u3OwJuXWbgC3aJ6HfN4bW00VSRbTpajWjxR_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MobTwo", "published": "2018-05-30T17:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "LocalBitcoinCash.org Launch Of Peer To Peer Online Shopping With Bitcoin Cash", "text": "After many weeks of hard work, we are really excited to announce the launch of our peer to peer online shopping platform. Anyone is welcome to participate in the Bitcoin Cash economy.\nOn the Menu, just look for \"Earn Bitcoin Cash\" > \"Manage Products\" if you are interested to be a seller. Or look for \"Spend Bitcoin Cash\" > \"Shopping\" if you are interested to go shopping.\nThis means that anyone can trade with anyone freely, instantly and safely via escrow. Anyone can be a seller today and sell physical or digital products.\nIf you're a charity organization, there is also a category for Charity/Donations. You can upload multiple products of different donation amounts and reward the users accordingly. For example, $1 donation will get you a digital certificate. $10 donation will get you a physical laminated certificate.\nThere is no commissions at all by the platform and we don't have any restrictions built in so users are welcome to message the sellers directly to deal outside of this platform.\nAll these fits with our objective of allowing anyone to earn a living online, especially people from failed states and corrupted countries. In many of these places, citizens had to suffer from the consequences of the failed government for many decades. Our hope is that with Bitcoin Cash, this will change and help lift someone up from poverty into economic freedom and equality.\nWe envision a world without borders where people are free to participate in this Bitcoin Cash economy and earn a living anywhere, especially in countries where hyperinflation destroyed citizen lives, mismanaged economies where job opportunities are almost none, and being able to trade freely is the difference between going to bed hungry or having food to eat.\nPlease go easy on us as this is an early release.

Bitcoin price volatility is known to be highly significant. It suffers from dramatic short-term price fluctuations conveying downside risk. However, from a long-term perspective, Bitcoin’s price is substantially up since early 2017 . Bitcoin’s Long-Term Skyrocketing Trajectory\nBitcoin is down considerably since early January 2017. However, if we calm the jitters caused by short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations and focus on the long-term trend, we can see that the cryptocurrency continues to perform spectacularly. As Ran NeuNer recently tweeted, “Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan. 2017.” Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan 2017. pic.twitter.com/kxPds6GZUF\n— Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) May 27, 2018\nGranted, if you entered the market after January 2017, this information might not be relevant. Indeed, if you are a short-term cryptocurrency investor, you might be losing money.\nShort-term and long-term investments carry different degrees of risk. Short-term investing carries more downside risk because it more closely resembles gambling.\nOn the other hand, long-term investment involves holding a vehicle for more than a year, or several years. Therefore, early Bitcoin adopters are doing well, even if they have had to suffer long bear market periods, as shown in the chart below.\nFinancial investors advise diversifying. For instance, Edward Jones, Financial Advisor, writes :\nAs an investor, you’ll probably need a mix of long-term and short-term vehicles. By knowing the differences between these two categories, you should have a good idea of what to expect from your investments — and this knowledge can help you make those choices that are right for you. The Trend Is Your Friend\nCertainly, whether Bitcoin’s price will continue its ascending trajectory is unknown. Nevertheless, predictions on both sides abound .\nFor example, The Motley Fool predicts that the entrance of institutional investors will be detrimental “as it introduces their crypto skepticism and deep pockets into the equation.”\nConversely, others predict that Bitcoin’s price will increase precisely because of the entrance of institutional investors. Explaining why “Bitcoin is a buy despite its continued losses,” Spencer Bogart, blockchain venture capitalist, declared to CNBC :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk.

Long-term investing is less risky than short-term. And, do not forget that “the trend is your friend.”\nDo you think the entrance of financial Institutions into the crypto market will affect Bitcoin’s price positively or negatively?
