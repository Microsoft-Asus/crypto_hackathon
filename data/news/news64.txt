They recently added Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and EOSIO (EOS) to their exchange.\nNigel Green, Founder, and CEO of DeVere Group said:\nThis mainstream expansion is clearly evidenced by the fact that more than a third [35 per cent] of wealthy individuals around the world – who are already likely to be successful investors – are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year.\nThe survey’s findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies.\nGreen also said that the one thing that investors cannot do is ignore Cryptocurrencies and this sector has huge potential and will grow exponentially in the next few years.\nHe Concludes by saying:\nI believe that there is no longer any doubt that cryptocurrencies in some form are the future of money. And, seemingly, this is a view increasingly shared by wealthy investors the world over. So Is it the right time to buy Bitcoin?\nIt Is According to Dan Morehead, Founder of Pantera Capital (which is one of the largest Hedge Funds in the world).\nBitcoin which reached a high of around $20000 has declined over 60% with a current price of $7637. Dan believes that this a bargain and definitely a good time to buy. He is bullish on Cryptocurrencies and says new high are yet to be reached.\nIt’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,\nDan said on Thursday in CNBC Fast Money. Cryptocurrencies are a largely unregulated industry and hence by taking a position before the regulations is advantageous.\nHe also said:\nMany institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,\nGetting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions.\nBitcoin has consistently given investors returns since its inception over the long term. Compared to last June it has appreciated by 198% which is more than most Fortune 500 companies.\nBitcoin has not traded above $7800 since May 23rd and would be a major to get through hurdle and The next key support would be $7000 according to Fundstrat Technician Robert Sluymer.\nImage Source: Flickr\nThank you for reading this article.

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

Some of the possible benefits include the immediate access to liquidity, immediate availability, and the efficiency of transactions. The real-time access to funds combined with the speed of transaction time could be seen as a big benefit to consumers. Another positive benefit could be the lower transaction costs which would be a result of the elimination of the intermediary or third party.\nMany cryptocurrencies will face some major hurdles in the upcoming months. There still seems to be a pervasive mindset of distrust among professionals and amateurs alike. High volatility and widespread value fluctuations can lead to second guessing among investors. Crypto market enthusiasts may see big potential, but others may be highly cautious. For the average investor, the degree of risk may be too high to comfortably risk hard earned capital. Investing in cryptocurrencies may involve a lot more research and examination. Crypto startups may be facing stiff competition as the market becomes more and more saturated.\nBecause digital currency is still relatively new and evolving, investors may not know the proper way to start evaluating crypto trades. Even the most seasoned traders and investors may still not have all the answers. There are definitely many unknowns in the space. Knowing what cryptos are real and viable may not be easy to determine. Crypto bulls may be out in force, but there is no way to tell how everything will shake out over the next year. Even though some cryptocurrencies may have a rocky road ahead, the underlying blockchain technology seems to be here to stay. The useful functionality of the blockchain technology is hard to deny. As more and more businesses start to adopt it, there is no telling just how transformative it will become.

Bitcoin operates independently of a central bank, and unlike bank accounts, Bitcoin wallets are not regulated or insured by the FDIC. Transactions are made without any middle men, which means, no banks, and for that reason, has become a popular investment for diversification. There are no transaction fees and no need to give your real name. Bitcoins are stored in a “digital wallet,” or virtual bank account, which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s computer. Several marketplaces called “Bitcoin exchanges” allow people to buy or sell Bitcoins using different currencies.\nPeople can compete to mine Bitcoins to solve complex math puzzles, which is how new Bitcoins are created. Typically, a winner is rewarded with 25 Bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes. There are various crypto-currencies out there today. Some other popular ones include Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, Dogecoin, and Maidsafecoin, but Bitcoin continues to be the top digital currency holding the most value on the market. Because the difficulty in mining Bitcoin has gone up, other crypto-currencies have become more popular to mine, having lower difficulty and more room to grow in the digital currency market. Bitcoin Mining Profitability\nIs Bitcoin mining still profitable in 2015? With today’s competition and new hardware technologies, the difficulty in mining Bitcoin today in 2015 is much more difficult than it was a few years ago as difficulty in mining has gone up with better technology and more competition. Bitcoins are becoming more scarce and difficult to mine, and large profitability is often often seen in larger scale operations located in areas with stable, low cost power. Take these mines for example, where owners are making upwards of about $8 million dollars a month!\nThough Bitcoin has become more difficult to mine, this has also opened doors to popularity in mining other digital currencies. To calculate profitability in any digital currency, you must consider the cost of power and equipment, current Bitcoin (or other digital currency market price), and hash rate, along with other considerations like how to run operations efficiently (pool your efforts, spend to earn, keep cool, have consistent power and uptime, etc).

We've covered the details in today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Also, Slovenia adopts a crypto action plan, Estonia drops plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, and Hungary claims it's ready to join the global blockchain market.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Expanding Horizons in a Bearish Month\nSpanish Parties Call for Favorable Crypto Regulations Lawmakers in Spain, who have earlier this year reviewed proposals to introduce incentives for crypto companies, have now issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. These should be introduced to the market \"through controlled testing environments.\" A draft legislation aimed at achieving the goal, proposed again by the ruling People's Party, has just won support from all parliamentary groups in the Finance and Public Function Committee of the Spanish Congress.\nThe legislative initiative calls for promoting the advantages of the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, including cost savings through the elimination of intermediaries in payments and transfers and the benefits it offers when it comes to raising capital, especially for startups. Its sponsors urge support for projects to build authorized blockchain technology networks, Europa Press reported.\nThe draft approved by Spain's leading parties also turns attention to the perils associated with crypto-related operations, calling for \"adequate dissemination of information about the risks\" assumed by investors, as well as their rights and the guarantees they can rely on. According to Spanish deputies, the approach will help to avoid \"economic damages that are impossible to repair\", such as those linked to high-risk financial products.\nLawmakers call on the government in Madrid to support the initiative and join the efforts of the National Securities Market Commission and the Bank of Spain in that direction. They also insist on reaching a common position in regards to the use and the regulation of cryptocurrencies on European level and ask the executive branch of power to work with other EU countries and institutions to achieve that.\nSlovenia Adopts Crypto and Blockchain Action Plan The government in Ljubljana has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in Slovenia and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. According to the Economy Ministry, the plan entails a series of measures designed to also regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Slovenian authorities hope to establish a safe and stable legal environment to help the creation, growth and development of blockchain technology-based projects and startups.\nAnother goal is to transpose in the national legislation the legal provisions adopted by European and other relevant institutions, STA reported. Local officials believe that the application of blockchain technologies can improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. The government also backed the creation of a European Blockchain Hub as a link between public and private stakeholders in the field, both in Slovenia and within the EU. On Thursday, the Slovenian Ministry of Economy was tasked to get actively involved in the hub.\nEstonia Backpedals on Plans for National Crypto Estonian officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized some time ago by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. According to Siim Sikkut, who is in charge of the country's IT strategy, Estonia has dropped its intentions to peg the Estcoin to the common European currency and offer it to all citizens. The digital tokens will instead be distributed as an incentive to e-residents of the Baltic country, Sikkut said in an interview, Bloomberg reported. These are foreign nationals who use Estonia's electronic identification system to remotely sign documents and set up companies.\nThe tech-savvy former Soviet republic was one of the first European nations to come up with plans for a national cryptocurrency. Similar initiatives have been discussed in Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, the UK, and other countries. The idea, however, was not appreciated by the ECB management. In September, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, criticized the proposal declaring that \"No member state can introduce its own currency. The currency of the Eurozone is the euro.\"\n\"We agreed in discussions with politicians that Estcoin will proceed as a means for transactions inside the e-resident community. Other options aren't on the table. We're not building a new currency,\" Siim Sikkut said. This was confirmed by the author of the Estcoin plan, Kaspar Korjus, who also noted that the details are still being analyzed for potential benefits. Estcoin \"would definitely not be a national 'cryptocurrency',\" he emphasized. Estonia's e-residency program has so far issued ID cards to more than 35,000 foreigners. The majority of the participants are from Finland, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\nHungary Prepared to Join the Global Blockchain Market Blockchaineum 2.0, arguably the largest blockchain summit in Central and Eastern Europe, recently gathered major stakeholders in Budapest to discuss blockchain-based solutions and other hot topics related to the implementation of the technology around the world. While many in Europe are just starting to take blockchain seriously, Hungary has been preparing for some time and now claims it's ready to join the global blockchain market.\n\"Many regulatory rules have been laid down recently on European level, and it is in Hungary's best interest to make use of them in order to become a regional center. Although, this won't happen because of regulation, but rather on purely market basis,\" said Tamás Czeglédi, quoted by the Budapest Business Journal . He is one of the organizers of the event and is working to put his country on the European blockchain map.\nHungarian business wants to jump on the blockchain bandwagon ahead of regional competitors and it has created a Blockchain Competence Center (BCC) earlier this year to prove its intentions. \"Whereas the EU had been focusing on regulation until around a year ago, the past few months saw a shift towards a more practical approach,\" said Péter Benedek, the CEO of BCC. \"The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,\" he added.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's Bitcoin in Brief topics?

In an affront to the efforts of hackers and blockchain forensics startups such as Chainalysis who work to expose the link between crypto users' real identities and their blockchain-based wallets, BestMixer.io has created a special pool system which guarantees the untraceability of coins mixed using their service.\nThe BestMixer.io pool system features three tiers (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), each serving different user needs but all achieving the same critical function: tumbling the identifying information latent unit of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is not anonymous though the only people who seem to have caught on to that fact are the hackers and government-backed agencies succeeding in exposing the identities behind crypto transactions. By depositing coins into one of the three BestMixer.io pools, users will receive clean bitcoin that is untraceable. \"Mixing bitcoins is an exchange of your coins to the appropriate amount from another source. To paraphrase, it is the disguising of where your coins have come from, and this makes it impossible to study your digital track,\" write the BestMixer.io team.\" On a global scale, to maintain the best level of anonymity you need to mix your coins every time you are going to send or receive them from a new source.\"\nThe advantages of such a practice are numerous. In the first place, users who employ the BestMixer.io bitcoin mixer will create an impassable moat between themselves and cybercriminals who wish to track their wallet down and steal their coins. Secondly, government agencies try to tie coins to illegal activities and then use this justification to put the law on their side when exposing the real identities tied to bitcoin wallets. \"A lot of companies are engaged in the analysis of blockchain, and in some cases, they study your particular transactions. Their goal typically is to enhance and clarify methods of blockchain analysis...Making it more challenging to remain out of control, and effortless for third parties to monitor your financial operations,\" state the BestMixer.io personnel.\nTo add to the advantages of using the BestMixer.io bitcoin mixer service, they feature an industry-best commission fee of 0.5% for the Alpha pool, a figure which decreases after using the discount code given after the first order.\nFirst-time users will be ecstatic to find a clear explanation of the service available in several languages and an attentive staff behind the help desk.\nThe BestMixer.io team has also added several novel functions to their user experience such as the 'mixing strength meter' which allows users to gauge the anonymity level of their coins, and a digitally signed 'letter of guarantee' which serves as a notification of BestMixer.io's obligations to providing users clean bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYDTKpTkCs", "https://bestmixer.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gamma", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T15:29:20.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07836a5f0e7fa435634f7f1d00e88726d645aba5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoGNlghdcdmHbc3jAFXrNOdJKV_viQ0Rg6oOoN9hAo13KnGS.iMpcRvhiJMDOm8EymZz8aEEOphfPRsvfGfvfAdhhLPWRJABv2W.WkGwrd0FUy6.4bKlig1Kg6gg1nXS7Me1P8ClArNgw--", "site_full": "gibcosta.com", "site": "gibcosta.com", "site_section": "http://gibcosta.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gibcosta", "title": "Crypto Exchange for Institutional Traders Launches in Gibraltar – Bitcoin News (press release)", "title_full": "Crypto Exchange for Institutional Traders Launches in Gibraltar – Bitcoin News (press release)", "published": "2018-06-02T15:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07836a5f0e7fa435634f7f1d00e88726d645aba5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoGNlghdcdmHbc3jAFXrNOdJKV_viQ0Rg6oOoN9hAo13KnGS.iMpcRvhiJMDOm8EymZz8aEEOphfPRsvfGfvfAdhhLPWRJABv2W.WkGwrd0FUy6.4bKlig1Kg6gg1nXS7Me1P8ClArNgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GibCosta", "published": "2018-06-02T15:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Exchange for Institutional Traders Launches in Gibraltar – Bitcoin News (press release)", "text": "Crypto Exchange for Institutional Traders Launches in Gibraltar Bitcoin News (press release) A new crypto trading platform providing services to institutional investors has made a soft launch in Europe.

(It was memorialized in the movie All the President’s Men ). It’s a useful saying for investors too.\nIn this week’s chart, we follow the money to see which bitcoin exchanges Americans (or U.S. dollar holders) are trading on.\nSo why is this chart important? Let’s follow the money...\nThe first thing to notice is the exchanges Americans are using to buy and trade bitcoin. That’s useful information. Remember the chart reflects only U.S. dollars being traded as bitcoin. It doesn’t reflect the yen (Japan), won (South Korea), euro (European Union) or other currencies being traded as bitcoin. That chart would look quite different.\nAt Early Investing, we’re fans of Coinbase. But as you can see, there are other exchanges out there that do plenty of business.\nThe second thing this chart does is approximate overall market activity. We should note that the data in this chart is just a snapshot from May 23, 2018. That Wednesday was a pretty busy day. If you had looked at this chart on Friday, May 25, you would have seen that the highest 24-hour trading volume was $182.7 million - a much quieter day.\nFinally, the chart helps measure the volume of trading activity on an exchange, which is an important factor in price volatility. Bitcoin is already volatile enough as it is. But the more trades that are happening on an exchange, the more you can believe those price gains (or losses) are real.\nAnd in the cryptocurrency world, all you can do is ask for real!\nGood investing,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vin narayanan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T08:13:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6300399cac3090ec51f171e456b1ad654590f605", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTvdGYwrwm8bGJrHFJlg2iY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "what is the future of virtual currency like bitcoin ?", "title_full": "what is the future of virtual currency like bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-06-02T14:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.489, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6300399cac3090ec51f171e456b1ad654590f605", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTvdGYwrwm8bGJrHFJlg2iY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stepwilli", "published": "2018-06-02T14:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "what is the future of virtual currency like bitcoin ?", "text": "Quote: from: Icoalert00 on May 31, 2018, 04:51:13 PM I am thinking that a while ago because bitcoin for the past 10 years it is still tough and it is still standing and kicking for all the holders.

represented in the Spanish Congress have voiced support for a new draft legislation introducing favorable crypto regulations in the country. We’ve covered the details in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Also, Slovenia adopts a crypto action plan, Estonia drops plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, and Hungary claims it’s ready to join the global blockchain market.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Expanding Horizons in a Bearish Month\nSpanish Parties Call for Favorable Crypto Regulations Lawmakers in Spain, who have earlier this year reviewed proposals to introduce incentives for crypto companies, have now issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. These should be introduced to the market “through controlled testing environments.” A draft legislation aimed at achieving the goal, proposed again by the ruling People’s Party, has just won support from all parliamentary groups in the Finance and Public Function Committee of the Spanish Congress.\nThe legislative initiative calls for promoting the advantages of the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, including cost savings through the elimination of intermediaries in payments and transfers and the benefits it offers when it comes to raising capital, especially for startups. Its sponsors urge support for projects to build authorized blockchain technology networks, Europa Press reported.\nThe draft approved by Spain’s leading parties also turns attention to the perils associated with crypto-related operations, calling for “adequate dissemination of information about the risks” assumed by investors, as well as their rights and the guarantees they can rely on. According to Spanish deputies, the approach will help to avoid “economic damages that are impossible to repair”, such as those linked to high-risk financial products.\nLawmakers call on the government in Madrid to support the initiative and join the efforts of the National Securities Market Commission and the Bank of Spain in that direction. They also insist on reaching a common position in regards to the use and the regulation of cryptocurrencies on European level and ask the executive branch of power to work with other EU countries and institutions to achieve that.\nSlovenia Adopts Crypto and Blockchain Action Plan The government in Ljubljana has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in Slovenia and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. According to the Economy Ministry, the plan entails a series of measures designed to also regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Slovenian authorities hope to establish a safe and stable legal environment to help the creation, growth and development of blockchain technology-based projects and startups.\nAnother goal is to transpose in the national legislation the legal provisions adopted by European and other relevant institutions, STA reported. Local officials believe that the application of blockchain technologies can improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. The government also backed the creation of a European Blockchain Hub as a link between public and private stakeholders in the field, both in Slovenia and within the EU. On Thursday, the Slovenian Ministry of Economy was tasked to get actively involved in the hub.\nEstonia Backpedals on Plans for National Crypto Estonian officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized some time ago by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. According to Siim Sikkut, who is in charge of the country’s IT strategy, Estonia has dropped its intentions to peg the Estcoin to the common European currency and offer it to all citizens. The digital tokens will instead be distributed as an incentive to e-residents of the Baltic country, Sikkut said in an interview, Bloomberg reported. These are foreign nationals who use Estonia’s electronic identification system to remotely sign documents and set up companies.\nThe tech-savvy former Soviet republic was one of the first European nations to come up with plans for a national cryptocurrency. Similar initiatives have been discussed in Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, the UK, and other countries. The idea, however, was not appreciated by the ECB management. In September, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, criticized the proposal declaring that “No member state can introduce its own currency. The currency of the Eurozone is the euro.”\n“We agreed in discussions with politicians that Estcoin will proceed as a means for transactions inside the e-resident community. Other options aren’t on the table. We’re not building a new currency,” Siim Sikkut said. This was confirmed by the author of the Estcoin plan, Kaspar Korjus, who also noted that the details are still being analyzed for potential benefits. Estcoin “would definitely not be a national ‘cryptocurrency’,” he emphasized. Estonia’s e-residency program has so far issued ID cards to more than 35,000 foreigners. The majority of the participants are from Finland, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\nHungary Prepared to Join the Global Blockchain Market Blockchaineum 2.0, arguably the largest blockchain summit in Central and Eastern Europe, recently gathered major stakeholders in Budapest to discuss blockchain-based solutions and other hot topics related to the implementation of the technology around the world. While many in Europe are just starting to take blockchain seriously, Hungary has been preparing for some time and now claims it’s ready to join the global blockchain market.\n“Many regulatory rules have been laid down recently on European level, and it is in Hungary’s best interest to make use of them in order to become a regional center. Although, this won’t happen because of regulation, but rather on purely market basis,” said Tamás Czeglédi, quoted by the Budapest Business Journal . He is one of the organizers of the event and is working to put his country on the European blockchain map.\nHungarian business wants to jump on the blockchain bandwagon ahead of regional competitors and it has created a Blockchain Competence Center (BCC) earlier this year to prove its intentions. “Whereas the EU had been focusing on regulation until around a year ago, the past few months saw a shift towards a more practical approach,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of BCC. “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” he added.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief topics?

These should be introduced to the market “through controlled testing environments.” A draft legislation aimed at achieving the goal, proposed again by the ruling People’s Party, has just won support from all parliamentary groups in the Finance and Public Function Committee of the Spanish Congress.\nThe legislative initiative calls for promoting the advantages of the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, including cost savings through the elimination of intermediaries in payments and transfers and the benefits it offers when it comes to raising capital, especially for startups. Its sponsors urge support for projects to build authorized blockchain technology networks, Europa Press reported.\nThe draft approved by Spain’s leading parties also turns attention to the perils associated with crypto-related operations, calling for “adequate dissemination of information about the risks” assumed by investors, as well as their rights and the guarantees they can rely on. According to Spanish deputies, the approach will help to avoid “economic damages that are impossible to repair”, such as those linked to high-risk financial products.\nLawmakers call on the government in Madrid to support the initiative and join the efforts of the National Securities Market Commission and the Bank of Spain in that direction. They also insist on reaching a common position in regards to the use and the regulation of cryptocurrencies on European level and ask the executive branch of power to work with other EU countries and institutions to achieve that. Slovenia Adopts Crypto and Blockchain Action Plan\nThe government in Ljubljana has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in Slovenia and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. According to the Economy Ministry, the plan entails a series of measures designed to also regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Slovenian authorities hope to establish a safe and stable legal environment to help the creation, growth and development of blockchain technology-based projects and startups.\nAnother goal is to transpose in the national legislation the legal provisions adopted by European and other relevant institutions, STA reported. Local officials believe that the application of blockchain technologies can improve the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy. The government also backed the creation of a European Blockchain Hub as a link between public and private stakeholders in the field, both in Slovenia and within the EU. On Thursday, the Slovenian Ministry of Economy was tasked to get actively involved in the hub. Estonia Backpedals on Plans for National Crypto\nEstonian officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized some time ago by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. According to Siim Sikkut, who is in charge of the country’s IT strategy, Estonia has dropped its intentions to peg the Estcoin to the common European currency and offer it to all citizens. The digital tokens will instead be distributed as an incentive to e-residents of the Baltic country, Sikkut said in an interview, Bloomberg reported. These are foreign nationals who use Estonia’s electronic identification system to remotely sign documents and set up companies.\nThe tech-savvy former Soviet republic was one of the first European nations to come up with plans for a national cryptocurrency. Similar initiatives have been discussed in Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, the UK, and other countries. The idea, however, was not appreciated by the ECB management. In September, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, criticized the proposal declaring that “No member state can introduce its own currency. The currency of the Eurozone is the euro.”\n“We agreed in discussions with politicians that Estcoin will proceed as a means for transactions inside the e-resident community. Other options aren’t on the table. We’re not building a new currency,” Siim Sikkut said. This was confirmed by the author of the Estcoin plan, Kaspar Korjus, who also noted that the details are still being analyzed for potential benefits. Estcoin “would definitely not be a national ‘cryptocurrency’,” he emphasized. Estonia’s e-residency program has so far issued ID cards to more than 35,000 foreigners. The majority of the participants are from Finland, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Hungary Prepared to Join the Global Blockchain Market\nBlockchaineum 2.0, arguably the largest blockchain summit in Central and Eastern Europe, recently gathered major stakeholders in Budapest to discuss blockchain-based solutions and other hot topics related to the implementation of the technology around the world. While many in Europe are just starting to take blockchain seriously, Hungary has been preparing for some time and now claims it’s ready to join the global blockchain market.\n“Many regulatory rules have been laid down recently on European level, and it is in Hungary’s best interest to make use of them in order to become a regional center. Although, this won’t happen because of regulation, but rather on purely market basis,” said Tamás Czeglédi, quoted by the Budapest Business Journal . He is one of the organizers of the event and is working to put his country on the European blockchain map.\nHungarian business wants to jump on the blockchain bandwagon ahead of regional competitors and it has created a Blockchain Competence Center (BCC) earlier this year to prove its intentions. “Whereas the EU had been focusing on regulation until around a year ago, the past few months saw a shift towards a more practical approach,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of BCC. “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” he added.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief topics?

This was confirmed by the author of the Estcoin plan, Kaspar Korjus, who also noted that the details are still being analyzed for potential benefits. Estcoin “would definitely not be a national ‘cryptocurrency’,” he emphasized. Estonia’s e-residency program has so far issued ID cards to more than 35,000 foreigners. The majority of the participants are from Finland, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\nHungary Prepared to Join the Global Blockchain Market Blockchaineum 2.0, arguably the largest blockchain summit in Central and Eastern Europe, recently gathered major stakeholders in Budapest to discuss blockchain-based solutions and other hot topics related to the implementation of the technology around the world. While many in Europe are just starting to take blockchain seriously, Hungary has been preparing for some time and now claims it’s ready to join the global blockchain market.\n“Many regulatory rules have been laid down recently on European level, and it is in Hungary’s best interest to make use of them in order to become a regional center. Although, this won’t happen because of regulation, but rather on purely market basis,” said Tamás Czeglédi, quoted by the Budapest Business Journal . He is one of the organizers of the event and is working to put his country on the European blockchain map.\nHungarian business wants to jump on the blockchain bandwagon ahead of regional competitors and it has created a Blockchain Competence Center (BCC) earlier this year to prove its intentions. “Whereas the EU had been focusing on regulation until around a year ago, the past few months saw a shift towards a more practical approach,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of BCC. “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” he added.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief topics?

However, things are not so somnolent ahead, as it’s hardly 12 days remaining for the Fifa World Cup, and cryptocurrencies are expected to get a boost from the world’s chest-thumping gaming fest.\nChina, once the third largest market of cryptocurrencies might undo the ban and regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs in near the future. Global Times, the Chinese government-affiliated news daily, has stated that “improved regulation makes more sense than just saying no to Bitcoin in China”.\nMeanwhile, the investigation by the US Justice Department is still on whether Bitcoin price is being manipulated by its HNIs or not. It is worth noting that around 1,000 HNIs hold over 40% of the cryptocurrency. This becomes more uneven in case of Ripple.\nLet’s take on this week’s Bitcoin stories! Indian Cryptocurrency Exchanges Bending Their Way Post RBI’s Barrier\nAs the RBI’s grace period to banks – dealing with cryptocurrency entities – is set to end next month, the Indian cryptocurrency exchanges which include Zebpay have explored other routes such as crypto-to-crypto to bend around the rules the tech way. While Unocoin has launched a new platform UNODAX, a multi-crypto asset exchange; BuyUcoin, another cryptocurrency exchange and wallet company, has now announced the launch of BuyUcoin Token (BUC).\nThe total supply of BUC will be over 100 Mn, says the company. The token can be used to pay any kind of fees on Global BuyUcoin Exchange, to avail discounts or to trade cryptocurrencies on the exchange.\nThe crypto-tokens will be available from tomorrow onwards. On June 1, 2018, BuyUcoin will be pursuing 25,000 BUC airdrops, the BUC will then be distributed to the BUC holders according to the ratio of the amount of BUC they are holding to the amount of total BUC booked at that time on BuyUcoin. Gujarat Police CID Investigating Bitcoin Crime Enters Phase Two\nAs the state police CID has intensified, the investigation of 2,000+ Bitcoin extortion from a Surat-based retailer, the police have decoded a Bitconnect firm involved in the crime.\nAs per a ToI report , the firm was managed in Surat by Divyesh Darji and Satish Kumbhani whereas Dhaval Mavani was looking after transactions. The police have also recovered 12 Bitcoins from Nikunj.\nNikunj has further informed the police that the promoters of the firm used to mention a special software that used to decide on low and high points of Bitcoin for purchase and sale respectively. The difference used to be earning and the firm had promised 365% annual return or 1% daily. Addicted To Cryptocurrencies? Here’s A Crypto Rehab Centre\nCryptomania has been on a ride across the world. While many have been enjoying it to the fullest. For some, it has turned to an addiction irrespective of their loss or gain .\nAs a result, a crypto-rehab centre has now been opened to help people get out of crypto-addiction, reported The Inquirer.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital stated , “The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nAs per the report, cryptocurrency trading addiction can be identified if a person exhibits some or all of 12 pointers noted by the hospital, including a person spending all their time and money trading, believing a big win is about to happen or even pawning their belongings to raise funds for trading. A Cryptocurrency For Community Service\nA Japanese startup Otaku Mode has planned to launch a new cryptocurrency called Otaku Coin which will serve as cross-border digital cash for smaller communities, such as hobbyists, that can be used within the group to build closer bonds and exchange assets reported The Japan Times.\nThe Tokyo-based startup runs an e-commerce site selling goods related to anime, manga, and video game titles . Its Otaku Coins are likely to be launched as early as this summer, and unlike many cryptocurrencies, Kodaka does not plan to make the new coins an investment tool with wildly fluctuating values. South Korea’s Top Court Recognizes Cryptocurrencies As Asset\nIn a major breakthrough, South Korean Supreme Court has now recognised Bitcoin as an asset with some economic value.\nThe development is in line with the similar decisions taken by Russian Federal Court, and Japanese regulatory understandings.\nThe latest decision by the South Korean Supreme Court has overturned the lower court’s ruling which had earlier refused to recognised so.\nAs per Korea Times , this marks the first time a cryptocurrency has been subject to confiscation. “The cryptocurrency is recognised to have value so it can be confiscated,” the Supreme Court stated.\nIn other news, Taiwan’s electronics company Asus has announced the launch of H370 Mining Master motherboard which is specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining. The board supports up to 20 graphics cards. A good prep for miners, huh?! Note: We at Inc42 take our ethics very seriously.

1.09% rise, to end the day at $1,007, to see Bitcoin Cash up 1.36% for the week.\nA choppy start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash recover from an early dip to $982.8 to an intraday high $1,016, before reversing to an intraday low $975. The day’s high and low steered clear of key support and resistance levels, with Bitcoin Cash struggling to hold on to $1,000 levels through the day, an end of day rally pulling Bitcoin Cash back through $1,000 to the day’s ending $1,007.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 0.18% to $1,000.3, in what’s been another choppy start to the day. A start of the day morning high $1,012.3 came up short of the day’s first major resistance level at $1,023.67, leading to a slide to a morning low $990.3, with $1,000 continuing to be a key level for Bitcoin Cash going into the weekend.\nFor the day ahead, investors will be looking out for signs of another weekend rally, with a hold at $1,000 levels key through the morning.\nA break through the day’s first major resistance level at $1,023.67 this morning would support a run at the day’s second major resistance level at $1,040.33 before any reversal, with the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 likely to continue to remain elusive though the day, the extended bearish trend still intact in spite of the upward momentum towards the end of the week.\nFailing to move through $1,020 levels and have a run at the day’s second major resistance level will likely see Bitcoin Cash pullback to sub-$1,000 levels to test the day’s first major support level at $982.67 before any recovery back through to $1,000 levels ahead of the day’s end.\nBCH/USD 02/06/18 4-Hourly Chart More Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today\nLitecoin in a Holding Pattern Litecoin gained 1.34% on Friday, following Thursday’s 0.96% rise, to end the day at $119.96, up 1.8% for the current week.\nFollowing a range bound start to the day, a mid-morning rally saw Litecoin strike an intraday high $120.82 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $120.7, leading to a reversal to an intraday low $117.0, Litecoin managing to avoid the day’s first major support level at $116.2 to recover to $118 levels.\nA late in the day move saw Litecoin move back through to $119 levels and into positive territory by the day’s end.\nAt the time of writing, Litecoin was up 0.1% to $120, recovering from a start of the day fall to a morning low $118.52.\nWhile managing to avoid the day’s first major support level at $117.7, the key level looks to be $120 for the day, with Litecoin’s $120.14 high leading to the reversal through to $118 levels.\nFor the day ahead, a break out from $120 through to $120.7 would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $121.52, with sentiment across the broader market to dictate whether the day’s second major resistance level at $123.08 is in play later in the day, investors still quick to lock in profits amidst the current extended bearish trend.\nFailure to break out from $120 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $121.52 would likely see a pullback through the morning’s low to test the day’s first major support level at $117.7 before any recovery. More material losses could be seen to bring the day’s second major support level at $115.44 into play, though sentiment across the market will need to materially deteriorate through the day.\nStory Continues While the bearish trend remains intact, positive momentum through the weekend would suggest a possible trend reversal, in the days ahead.\nLTC/USD 02/06/18 4-Hourly Chart More Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly\nRipple Looking for a Break Out Ripple’s XRP gained 1.75% on Friday, following Thursday’s 1.63% rise, to end the day at $0.62247. Four consecutive days of gains, coming off the back of the Monday 8.85% slide left Ripple’s XRP up 3.53% for the current week, Monday through Friday.\nAn early rally saw Ripple’s XRP hit a morning high $0.62123, before sliding to an intraday low $0.59843, leaving the day’s first major resistance and support levels untested through the morning.\nA choppy afternoon led to Ripple’s XRP hitting a late in the day rally to move through to an intraday high $0.62372 before easing back to the day’s ending $0.62247, with Ripple’s XRP failing to test the day’s first major resistance level to bring the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6434 into play.\nAt the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 0.25% to $0.62319, with Ripple’s XRP recovering from an early $0.61281 low to strike a morning high $0.62449, holding on to $0.62 levels through the morning key to supporting a rally in the second half of the day.\nFor the day ahead, a move through $0.628 would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6313 to bring the day’s second major resistance level at $0.6402 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6434 into play, Ripple’s XRP looking to reverse the extended bearish trend formed in late April.\nFailing to move through $0.628 could see Ripple’s XRP pullback through to sub-$0.62 levels, with any material deterioration in market sentiment likely to see Ripple’s XRP slide through the day’s first major support level at $0.6060 to test the day’s second major support level at $0.5896.\nIt’s been a slow start to the weekend, but we would expect further gains through the day, as Ripple’s XRP begins to form a near-term bullish trend from 29 th May’s swing lo $0.543, though Ripple’s XRP will need to break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6434 to affirm a reversal.\nXRP/USD 02/06/18 4-Hourly Chart More Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: FTSE 100 falls significantly during the week

Interested customers can register now for the upcoming information session.\nLaunching on June 6 The wait for 7nm bitcoin mining products from Japanese internet giant GMO may be nearing to a close, as the company announced Thursday:\nGMO Internet Group will launch GMO miner B2, which is our own high-performance computer for mining (mining machine), on Wednesday, June 6, 2018. We will mass-produce the world’s first mining machine equipped with a cutting-edge 7 nm process based semiconductor chip (7nm mining chip; ‘GMO 72b’), which will be shipped at the end of October 2018.\nIllustration of GMO miner B2 provided by GMO. The company has been working on research and development of the 7nm mining chip since September last year.\nGMO has been using “store-bought mining computers” for its mining operation launched in December, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported . Now it is ready to start producing its own mining equipment made with this 7nm chip, which GMO will use for its in-house mining operation as well as offer “the others to potential customers who are planning to mine,” the company confirmed.\nWhile GMO has not released images of the real mining hardware, the company has provided some illustrative images of the GMO miner B2 currently in development.\nIllustration provided by GMO. Interested Customers Can Register Now “An information session for potential customers considering the purchase of GMO miner B2 will be held on Wednesday, June 6 in Shibuya, Tokyo, and we will explain the details of GMO miner B2, such as price and performance,” GMO’s announcement reads.\nThere will also be an information session for the company’s cloud mining service on the same day. The sessions will be in Japanese. Registration is open to both interested customers and institutional investors. “Customers who have not registered in advance will be refused admission,” GMO emphasized.\nFurthermore, GMO Internet no longer plans to use an initial coin offering (ICO) for the sale of its 7nm mining boards as announced in October last year.
