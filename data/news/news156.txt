Avoid hoarding too much Bitcoin\nYou may be tempted to hoard Bitcoin up to a mountain. But, this way is quite risky. In addition to the uncertainty of value and regulation of Bitcoin in the future, Bitcoin deposits can also invite hacking. For beginners, I think it's better to take advantage of trading in a short span of time, such as weekly.\n3. Keep track of Bitcoin prices\nBitcoin values ‚Äã‚Äãcontinue to move every minute. Hence, you need to monitor the movement.\n4. Invest some bitcoin for cloud mining\nTo avoid losses due to the decline in the value of Bitcoin, you can take advantage of cloud mining.

Sunday at around 3.30pm.\nKidnappers demanded a ransom of 15 Bitcoin for Marite's \"safe release\". Bitcoin is cryptocurrency valued at almost R100 000 each.\n\"Do not involve the police. We are monitoring all your communications and movements,\" said the note.\nThe note added that if the Bitcoins are not paid on time, Marite will be hanged then decapitated and a video of his death will be sent to the parents.\nPolice spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that Marite had been found alive in Witbank.\n\"He has been found alive... less than an hour ago in Witbank,\" he said.\nHlathi was unable to provide more details around his safe return or whether the kidnappers had been paid their ransom.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hlathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonard hlathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katlego marite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marite", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mpumalanga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witbank - mpumalanga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frangipani street", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:09:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dce8cc35860839c0da374145f9fdb8948618b6f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSeUJWEVWkbsjUgiG7HwdjeMkMqMnVQxXafk2CIr5Wd3Qvf9m2mc9sgG5atjhhvwXnxAFav2Wzf185MkbmAPqSyLhEvfTWW6r0iVmB0WBwXcA--", "site_full": "diyatv.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://diyatv.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BLOGGER", "title": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T15:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/bBoTE485BaT-pZNd-Qf7HcNgthZ29Zhv-04Aq1vo8zxnpxXwTNajlpO7fvMszuIsKQ7gcGbxCFHWanvGZO6aUs4n8xp61jFowSY9I4b8TuQ_PIZ5mb3Fp4ru9bx1OTAusBfr_w=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dce8cc35860839c0da374145f9fdb8948618b6f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSeUJWEVWkbsjUgiG7HwdjeMkMqMnVQxXafk2CIr5Wd3Qvf9m2mc9sgG5atjhhvwXnxAFav2Wzf185MkbmAPqSyLhEvfTWW6r0iVmB0WBwXcA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "paksvideo (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T15:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "from https://ift.tt/2s5b9U8 U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation Reviewed by paksvideo on May 24, 2018 Rating: 5 Share This: A Marketing Project for the Entire Crypto Community ‚Äì \"What Would Satoshi Say?\" Hello people of R/Cryptocurrency.

I won't go as far as saying I can tell you if any of them are advantages or disadvantages, because I don't think I can.\nIf both your exchange company and their banking is in your country, then there is no question if there is any legal obligation on your part to tell your government that you dared move money outside the country. Check your laws; if you're middle class, you'll be surprised how low the trigger amount for such issues that you might think would afflict only the seriously affluent can be.\nOne thing that is not very different is that no bitcoin exchange I am aware of is fully compliant with all laws fit for all sorts of similar enterprises for every location where they do business, and most probably are not compliant in any or only in hardly any. Some like to advertise their compliance, but I suppose the one case (campbx) where I did get more information on that by inquiring is typical. They wrote me earlier this year that they were then only compliant with the (comparatively easy) Federal FinCEN rules, not the rather tough state money transmitter licensing, although they emphasized their efforts towards progress on that front.\nWhilst you may argue that this is mostly because many people don't get how these laws cannot possibly apply to bitcoin businesses, that hasn't stopped authorities in some countries from temporarily seizing a bank account of a bitcoin exchange (one case I know of was in Poland, and one not related to such laws in Germany) or even seizing a bank account for forfeiture (one case I know of in the USA).\nSo this is not different, but still there is the subtle but important distinction if there is even a chance that your exchange will be allowed to remain in business and at least try to continue honoring its obligations to its customers (as happened with MtGox, even after a possibly minor bank account they had in the US was seized for forfeiture for failing to have state licensing).\nI wonder if it would go the same way for an exchange based in the US. Or in comparable countries, for that matter. For a UK company banking in Germany and Poland, the empirical answer is no (bitcoin-24 stopped doing business after its German bank acount was temporarily seized and hence released back to them, and their Polish bank account was simultaneously seized but at least not completely released back to them yet).

According to Interfax, the admission of guilt has been received by the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office of the Russian Federation and is being transferred to the Moscow police department in the Ostankino district.\nBTC-e was a major Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange from its launch in 2011 until its forced closure in July 2017. United States authorities seized the website‚Äôs domain name and 38% of all customer funds on 28 July 2017 , and since then the exchange has been closed. BTC-e was indicted for operating an illegal international money laundering scheme, including laundering of Bitcoins from Japan-based exchange Mt Gox hack, the largest Bitcoin theft in history.\nThree days before BTC-e was shut down and customer funds were seized, Vinnik was arrested while on vacation in Greece at the request of the United States. He was accused of laundering between USD 4 billion and USD 9 billion in cryptocurrency. He has already been hit with a fine of USD 12 million from FinCEN in the US.\nAlthough BTC-e originally released a statement saying Vinnik was not an employee of the exchange, he has since admitted that he was a technical consultant for the exchange , and now admits he was in charge. He has sent four letters admitting his guilt to the head of Russia‚Äôs ministry of internal affairs, the ministry‚Äôs chief investigator, and the Prosecutor General of Russia. He claims responsibility for RUB 750 million worth of damage to Russian citizens between 2011 and 2017 as well as for a large amount of computer information fraud.\nHe has offered to help Russian authorities with the investigation and this has apparently almost cost him his life. Local media reported that Russian criminals conspired to poison him before he could get to court in Russia and testify. Since the poisoning attempt, he has been put under a special lockdown at the Greek prison where is staying; no one can come into contact with him or give him food besides the prison guards.\nThe United States and Russia have been fighting for the right to extradite Alexander Vinnik to their respective countries. In January 2018, he submitted an application for asylum in Greece, saying the charges were politically motivated. Before he can be extradited, the asylum request must be decided on by the Justice Minister of Greece.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post BTC-e‚Äôs Vinnik Confesses to Laundering Billions of Dollars of Bitcoin appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Concerning Price Manipulation Bitcoin Sheds 3% over News of DoJ Probe Concerning Price Manipulation 0\nBitcoin‚Äôs price fell by more than 3% on Thursday morning following the news of a U.S. Justice Department probe into price manipulation in cryptocurrency markets.\nThe investigation was revealed in a Bloomberg piece that said federal prosecutors were working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the private review.\nThe investigation is reportedly focused on the possibility that some may be employing tactics such as flooding markets with fake orders, in order to manipulate prices.\nIt is certainly the case that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are frequently subject to wild swings that are not easily explained, so this might be why. It may also be true that not all exchanges implement strict controls to spot and stop this sort of cheating.\nBitcoin, currently at a price of just $7,380 (down 6.4% in the last 24 hours‚Äô trading), almost hit $20,000 late last year. The subsequent tumbles in its price were largely precipitated by crackdowns on exchanges.\nChina took the most drastic steps, first by banning initial coin offerings‚Äîa form of fund-raising involving the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens‚Äîand then by banning exchanges outright. New exchange regulations in South Korea and Japan also caused drops in Bitcoin‚Äôs price.\nThe New York attorney general last month launched an initial probe into the measures that exchanges are taking to protect customers and provide transparency in their operations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "news of doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj probe concerning price manipulation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:55:04.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c64128c3269517cc3ef9c0fae63241d3089b736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWL4.fplZp2gU8cGJk4cAKmbxOSXASigIeeYlWtZwNkXHjSM3Y5PvdcM3SSZE8rffSPLJUKIRJmdE1lIfel6MuHJyqhp49gtXs6Kww6mXM6w--", "site_full": "www.whatsonthorold.com", "site": "whatsonthorold.com", "site_section": "https://www.whatsonthorold.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "WhatsOnThorold", "title": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) plunges -4.33% on May 23-24", "title_full": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) plunges -4.33% on May 23-24", "published": "2018-05-24T15:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.whatsonthorold.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c64128c3269517cc3ef9c0fae63241d3089b736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWL4.fplZp2gU8cGJk4cAKmbxOSXASigIeeYlWtZwNkXHjSM3Y5PvdcM3SSZE8rffSPLJUKIRJmdE1lIfel6MuHJyqhp49gtXs6Kww6mXM6w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Richard Conner", "published": "2018-05-24T15:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) plunges -4.33% on May 23-24", "text": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) plunges -4.33% on May 23-24\nMay 24, 2018 - By Richard Conner\nBitcoin Atom (BCA) had a bad 24 hours as the cryptocurrency declined $-0.21743845 or -4.33% trading at $4.80976303.

The goal is to mitigate the loud humming noise that emanates from the fan blades as they cool off the computer servers that run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nNeighbors have complained about the incessant and loud hum for many months, saying they can‚Äôt open their windows and sleep at night. They also worry about long-term health effects, such as hearing loss.\nProject Spokane applied for and was granted all required permits by Missoula County for its business. Because there are no county noise regulations for industrial sites, they say they are in full compliance with the law.\nBut County Commissioner Dave Strohmaier suggested that may change. He said the Board of County Commissioners will meet on June 14 to ‚Äúcontemplate emergency zoning relative to crypto-currency mining in Missoula County.‚Äù\nJoanne Weimer, a resident of the area near the mill site, wrote a letter to the development board calling the sound ‚Äúaggravating, intense and to some, totally intolerable.‚Äù She said she feels betrayed by the county commissioners for allowing the ‚Äúterrible business‚Äù into the lives of the residents, claiming they should have been aware of the risks of a bitcoin operation because surveys conducted by other communities found ‚Äúoffensive noise‚Äù was the most oft-cited complaint.\nOther residents of Bonner said that the noise from the bitcoin facility is even worse than when the now-defunct Stimson lumber mill was in full operation.\nNelson defended his decision to request TIF funds, which come from the increment of additional property tax revenue generated by businesses that were created after the formation of the Bonner Mill Tax Increment Financing Industrial District in 2012. Property tax revenue that is generated above and beyond what was being generated in 2012 is diverted away from the county‚Äôs general fund and is supposed to be reinvested back for projects that benefit the public.\nNelson argued that his request is exactly what the TIF funds are supposed to go toward.\nHe and Stivers noted that the Montana Department of Revenue has told them the company will be paying over $300,000 in property and business equipment taxes this year.\n‚ÄúOur community has been extremely patient in this process, and now we think it‚Äôs time to act,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúIn your TIF documents, based on critical considerations, the goals are to foster and revitalize the millsite to adjacent homes and the surrounding community.‚Äù\nOne board member, Ben Fitch-Fleischmann, wanted to know why taxpayers should foot the bill rather than the business. He said he thought that bitcoin operators generate lots of profit.\n‚ÄúA good neighbor takes care of their own problems instead of asking the taxpayers to do it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt do just what‚Äôs (legally required).‚Äù\nNelson said that TIF funds are also supposed to go toward ‚Äúreducing or preventing or abating pollution‚Äù and although he clarified that this project generates noise pollution, he felt it qualified.\nNelson and Project Spokane hired a sound engineer who they say found decibel levels of about 95 near the fan blades, with spikes at certain frequencies. The engineer told them that different fan blades will reduce the amount of sound by half, which equals about 10 decibels, and the new blades will also reduce the spikes at the two frequencies. They‚Äôve already installed test fans to confirm the hypothesis.\n‚ÄúWhen Project Spokane came to Bonner, they sent in a zoning compliance permit request that went to the county,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúThe county looked at it. I have emails. They are in perfect compliance.\n\"There is no zoning regulation regarding noise in heavy industrial. They‚Äôre not in violation, so why would they want to pay even if they could? We‚Äôre the developer. I don‚Äôt have a spare $135,000 lying around. They haven‚Äôt done anything wrong, that would be my first comment.‚Äù\nNelson also said he believed blockchain technology might be the wave of the future, just like credit cards were when they were first introduced or like the Internet was in the 1990s.\nJim Valeo, a member of the MDA board, was adamantly opposed to the request.\n‚ÄúYou guys brought this business here and no products are produced and huge amounts of power are consumed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is not a taxpayers‚Äô responsibility. Those (TIF provisions) are with regard to starting (a business) and helping with sidewalks, not about solving a problem that you created, which is what you guys did when you put that thing there.‚Äù\nValeo also told Nelson and Stivers that they shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúsit on‚Äù the fact that they‚Äôre in compliance with the county‚Äôs laws. Valeo suggested that there could be a class-action lawsuit in the future.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not good citizens,‚Äù Valeo continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre offensive citizens. It‚Äôs an unfortunate development. You didn‚Äôt do your homework to see what could happen there. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, this is not a taxpayer response. I hope for the sake of the company you will be man enough to take care of it. I hope for both the owners of the property and the operating company you can solve this problem. Saying ‚Äòwe comply with all regulations‚Äô‚Ä¶sorry guys, that doesn‚Äôt cut it.‚Äù\nAt one point, Stivers, of Project Spokane, became upset at the line of questioning.\n‚ÄúIs a $300,000 check real to either of you?‚Äù Stivers asked, referring to the property tax he says the state told him he will pay. ‚ÄúIs that not real money? We‚Äôll be committing four times that ongoing. We did everything regulatory correct coming into this community and have invested millions of dollars.‚Äù\nStivers then showed Fitch-Fleischmann an email from a Montana Department of Revenue worker to confirm that the company‚Äôs property tax bill will be over $300,000.\n‚ÄúI just did the math, and $135,000, that‚Äôs 18 bitcoin,‚Äù Fitch-Fleischmann responded. ‚ÄúIt feels like small money to you guys. It feels like small money, and it‚Äôs difficult to see why you don‚Äôt just step up and do it. It‚Äôs clearly a complex community issue that needs to be talked about.''\nStivers responded by saying that the company ‚Äúcompetes on a global scale‚Äù for what they provide and at one point suggested that the only way to resolve the issue was to relocate the company.\nThe board took a vote on the motion and, because it was a 4-4 tie, the motion will not go to the Board of County Commissioners for approval.\nProject Spokane has applied for Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund job creation grants from the state in the past, but withdrew their application. The company has so far not received any taxpayer dollars.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 30.0869. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 38.06. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 37 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -135.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn‚Äôt generated until the indicator crosses above -100.

The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.‚Äù\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company‚Äôs operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX.\nIn Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o ‚Äî Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018 Ripple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks.\nShould Bitcoin Be Used by Banks?\nMany token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin‚Äôs genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer. Instead of going through a bank, users could set up their own wallets and send transactions without using a bank, but novices may find this risky as mistakes can happen.\n* * *\nThe question is - will this enable BMV customers to get around any future capital controls enforced by the government should this currency collapse turn even more crisis-er?\nSource: Zero Hedge ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tyler durden wed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim copeland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "argentine bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsbtc.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin templeton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:56:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6c63f51114c5528adbf80bc1e7830af89b4bcd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_IPrYtzcjyuiIx6zxU5Y20uhkzwbp7tw0iRV0LmdLFQ.RHDIO_3qDAAwA8tDtqbUGqJ2iuAfIcF38wnkADM6QhlFm3ukENgcjYb_w2QoBOBQ--", "site_full": "www.eclipsetrendy.com.ng", "site": "eclipsetrendy.com.ng", "site_section": "http://www.eclipsetrendy.com.ng/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Eclipse Trendy", "title": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin.", "title_full": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin.", "published": "2018-05-24T14:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6c63f51114c5528adbf80bc1e7830af89b4bcd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_IPrYtzcjyuiIx6zxU5Y20uhkzwbp7tw0iRV0LmdLFQ.RHDIO_3qDAAwA8tDtqbUGqJ2iuAfIcF38wnkADM6QhlFm3ukENgcjYb_w2QoBOBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kelvin Orji (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T14:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin.", "text": "\nA criminal gang, which kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday, is demanding a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency of nearly $120,000.\nPolice spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi said Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank.\nThe town is located in the eastern province of Mpumalanga in South Africa.\n‚ÄúThey demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,‚Äù he told news channel eNCA.\n‚Äú(The parents) don‚Äôt even know what these bitcoins are.

The assets will be divided into four categories: Coins, Platforms, Applications and Physical Assets tokens, depending on the transaction volume value of the previous quarter. Huobi further states that the main force index will be published by Bloomberg and other communication organizations later on, and users may view the index by logging in on their devices.\n\"The goal here is to provide a complete and organized tool which will help enhance the overall knowledge of the blockchain industry. We are committed to bringing more insights and data so key stakeholders can make the most knowledgeable decisions when it comes to their investments,\" said Leon Li, founder and CEO of Huobi Group.\nUS Megabanks Less Safe Than Crypto? Americans now have a new reason to consider moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies ‚Äì the expected decision by banking regulators to water down the Volcker Rule, which restricts the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading with depositor funds. This according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. They explain that due to the rule changes, banks will now be able to gamble more freely in a scheme that gives them the quick profits but gives depositors the ultimate risks. In contrast, holders of cryptocurrencies are not exposed to those kinds of risks as they can control their money directly with no custody by third parties and no need to trust a central authority.\n\"With this rule change, the authorities will make it easier for megabanks to take big risks with other people's money. But they are making the change precisely when global debt levels imply record risks,\" the authors argue. \"In the future, cryptocurrencies will do such a fundamentally better job as a safe depository of funds it's difficult to envision a world in which this technology does not become a game-changer for money and banking.\"\nWhat do you think about today's news updates?

The investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices -- such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling. So much for Bitcoin being an anonymous trading vehicle. The DOJ is going to rip into the big players and look deep under the hood. Bitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent in the last 24 hours to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. In late December 2017, Bitcoin traded as high as $19783.06. Although I have been highly suspicious of Bitcoin, I did advise it asa trade for high risk investors but got out in December. I wrote on December 21, 2017 in the EPJ Daily Alert : Over the last two weeks, Bitcoin has climbed to near $20,000 and is now trading in the $15,500 range. This trading strikes me as significantly different from the trading in the period just before this. Among the four potential factors that I have listed that could bring the price down was buying exhaustion. Since e-currency buying is completely driven by new buying rather than any underlying fundamentals, once the buyers stop coming the price will collapse. Current trading suggests that this may be exhaustion price activity. There may be some added buying coming in over Christmas as \"bitcoin geniuses\" sit around the Christmas tree telling their friends and relatives how easy it is to make money in Bitcoin but that could be the last upward draft. But I am not waiting around. It is time to take profits. I identified the new \"American run\" in Bitcoin at around $4,000 anyone who was aggressive enough to buy at that time has very huge profits. The same thing with my mention of ethereum at $250 and again at $400, It is now trading at $790. There may be more upside in the future but e-currency is a very high-risk investment in the first place and it is now getting riskier. I'm out. Bitcoin appears to be mostly a large pump and dump scheme. I am no fan of government investigations but the schmuck small-time Bitcoin traders who are showing huge losses are going to be surprised as to what the DOJ reports after it investigates.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. justice department opens criminal probe into bitcoin price mani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department opens criminal probe into bitcoin price manipulation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:16:30.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b752ee51419f81282f866592a4fdb81b4cef94e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4LL3RxRkN_uhr36DN2tiqd0fJsGb.CeOY4qt9jNfYPM9Ou2yMNRQzCg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues", "published": "2018-05-24T14:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b752ee51419f81282f866592a4fdb81b4cef94e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4LL3RxRkN_uhr36DN2tiqd0fJsGb.CeOY4qt9jNfYPM9Ou2yMNRQzCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T14:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues", "text": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues\nJoseph Young\nThe bitcoin price has dropped below the $7,300 mark as the valuation of the cryptocurrency market declined by more than $25 billion, from $350 billion to $325 billion over the past 24 hours.

By - May 24, 2018 The cost of the first crypto currency grew during the last few hours and reached the mark of $7,730, but then started to decline again. According to experts, in the near future, prices should not be expected to wait\nOn Thursday, May 24, the average market price of bitcoin again dropped to $7,600. Crypto currency valued over the past few hours, but after it rose to $7,735, it began to become cheaper again. Just last night the coin was trading at $7,900, the value fell by more than $400 for a short period of time, at night it was $7,400.\nAnalyst Fundstrat Tom Lee in an interview with CNBC said that this decline is due to the typical volatility of digital money. He claims that by the end of the year the price of the coin will reach $25,000.\nSpecialist noted that the cost of production of the first crypto currency is $6 000, which is lower than the price of bitcoin on the market. Li believes that institutional investors will soon come to the market, this will positively affect the course of the coin.\n‚ÄúI believe that institutional investors are very interested in this market, but they have not yet entered into the crypto-currencies because of regulatory uncertainties. But their access to crypto-currencies as a class of assets will eventually become a powerful factor for the growth of bitcoin, ‚Äúhe said.\nThe founder of Fundstrat added that historically the main increase in the price of bitcoin occurs in just ten days. Therefore, investors need to keep the crypto currency, as its rate will increase dramatically to $25,000.\n‚ÄúHistorically, all the results of the bitcoin price for a single year are for 10 days. If we exclude these 10 days, we will find that each year bitcoin drops by 25%. No matter how sad it would be to hold bitcoin for $8,000, a jerk from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a few days, ‚ÄúLee said.\nIn turn, the analyst of the GC Forex Club Ivan Marchena sure yesterday‚Äôs drop in the cost of bitcoin was quite predictable. The market is under pressure due to the fight against crypto-currency start-ups, which in early May launched financial regulators from the US and Canada.\n‚ÄúOne of the news that adversely affects the market is the message that the financial regulators of the US and Canada are fighting the crypto-currency start-ups under Operation Cryptosweep. Negative attitude on the part of regulators frankly frightens investors who seek to fix risks by exiting from crypto-currency assets. Of the relatively positive news, we can note the news from the Russian Federation that the State Duma adopted in the first reading a draft law on the digital economy that introduces the concept of ‚Äúdigital money‚Äù, which is not recognized as a legal means of payment. Against this background, we expect that the decline in the Crypto-currency may continue in the near future, ‚Äúthe expert believes.\nThe chairman of the supervisory board of JSC ‚ÄúBank Voronezh‚Äù Murad Salikhov agreed with the analyst of the GC Forex Club. He believes that the situation that is developing in the market was quite predictable.\n‚ÄúIn the market, now you can observe the downward movement and the falling falls into this movement. Significant news for critical currency in the market is almost gone, and what is observed is characteristic of digital assets. I believe that in the near future such dynamics will continue, ‚ÄúSalikhov said.\nThe owner of the Sauber Bank and the head of eCoinomic Alexei Smolyanov believes that several factors influenced the market correction.\n‚ÄúThis correction was preceded by two factors. First ‚Äì following the Japanese exchange Coincheck, the decision to delinquent anonymous coins was taken by the leadership of the Korean stock exchange Korbit. This is due to the tightening of legislation and the desire to protect themselves from ‚Äúdirty‚Äù operations. The second factor that influenced the mood on the market: the recognition of Alexander Vinnik Russian justice in that he laundered money through the BTC-E exchange.

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world - particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing - flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one's position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg's sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US's latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise - it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 - has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That‚Äôs prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren‚Äôt registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn‚Äôt regulate what‚Äôs known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nGiven the pressure that the IRS has put on companies like Coinbase to turn over customer information, the DOJ investigation could also ensnare a few exchanges - particularly after the collapse of Mt Gox, the former Tokyo-based exchange has been liquidated after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers' bitcoin.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the limited oversight of the crypto market (the same reason given by the SEC for rejecting a proposed rule change that would've cleared the way for an ETF) makes it vulnerable to fraud. And exchanges are increasingly realizing that if manipulation isn't eliminated, or at least suppressed, that customers could start walking away from what they now believe to be a rigged market... then again, investors have stuck with stocks and bonds through every financial crisis in the history of modern, post-central bank \"capitalism.\"\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets. \"There‚Äôs very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,\" Griffin said. \"It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry‚Äôs growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a ‚Äúbuyer beware‚Äù approach to oversight.\nThat said, good luck : determining who is manipulating prices and who has inside information would be next to impossible in the anonymous world of bitcoin, which is subject to different regulations in different markets. Japan and the Philippines have already developed their own legal framework for crypto markets.\nStudies have shown that 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. Given this naturally top-heavy concentration, it could be difficult for prosecutors to prove that there's anything illegal going on when the largest players step up to trade.\nIronically, most of the recent \"manipulation\" has been to the detriment of bulls: for example, when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee who has earned the nickname \"the Tokyo Whale\" for his ability to crash prices while unloading massive quantities of bitcoin decides to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins in a single block - crashing the price - is he manipulating the market?\nBut that doesn't mean spoofing isn't happening. For years, the twitter user @bitfinexed (who has since switched his account to private) has documented the work of \"spoofy\" ( who was also profiled here ) - a nickname he used for a group of traders who would place, and then cancel, large orders on different exchanges. He has also highlighted other shady behavior, like the Bitfinexed tether token, which is supposed to allow crypto traders to go from cash to coin more quickly. But we imagine - particularly as more institutions become exposed to the bitcoin market - that the Feds will investigate every scrap of potentially nefarious activity in due time.\nMeanwhile, we imagine crypto enthusiasts will be less than delighted at this news, with accusations that the US is turning into China set to emerge as crypto doomsayers claim the US government is finally making its move against bitcoin.

Population", "text": "By Erin Hobey\nEarlier this week Digital challenger bank Revolut asked customers to help name its new and exclusive metal card . Now the maverick platform has moved again from metal to crypto: Revolut customers can buy, hold and sell two more cryptocurrencies instantly within the app. In December last year, Revolut launched an app feature that allows its 1.8 million customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies instantly from within the app. In addition to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, Revolut has today added XRP and Bitcoin Cash to its list of growing cryptocurrencies. In addition to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, @RevolutApp has today added #XRP and #BTC Cash to its list of growing #Cryptocurrencies. Click To Tweet ‚ÄúWe launched this world-first feature in order to offer frictionless exposure of Cryptocurrencies to the mainstream population. The idea of exchanges, private keys and cold storage is a complete turn off for some people, so we wanted to offer a simple way for consumers to get exposure in this area,‚Äù explained Revolut Co-Founder & CTO Vlad Yatsenko . ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been asking the Revolut community which Cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming. After months of negotiations and development work, we‚Äôre incredibly excited to offer exposure to these two digital currencies to the UK market.‚Äù\nRevolut customers may instantly exchange 25 fiat currencies directly into Cryptocurrency, which can then be securely held and sold directly within the app in seconds, and even allows customers to set up alerts whenever a specific Cryptocurrency hits a certain value. Revolut said that the addition of XRP and Bitcoin Cash stems from ‚Äúoverwhelming demand‚Äù from the Revolut community and the fact that major Cryptocurrency exchanges are yet to support these digital currencies.\nLast week, Revolut launched a new savings feature called Vaults , which allows customer to round up their card payments to the nearest whole number and save up their spare change in Cryptocurrencies. Since then, more than 50,000 customers have set up a Cryptocurrency Vault. Since July 2015, London-based @RevolutApp has signed up 1.7M+ customers across Europe and processed 60M transactions with a total volume transaction of $15B to date. #fintech #crypto Click To Tweet\nUnicorn recap: Revolut launched in July 2015 with a punchy mission: to turn the financial banking sector on its head. With Revolut, users can set up an app-based current account in 60 seconds, spend abroad in over 150 currencies with no fees, hold and exchange 25 currencies in-app and send free domestic and international money transfers with the real exchange rate. Since July 2015, the London-based fintech disruptor has signed up over 1.7 million customers across Europe and processed 60 million transactions with a total volume transaction of $15 billion to date. Revolut has raised a total of $336M from some of the most notable investors including Index Ventures, Balderton Capital, Ribbit Capital and DST Global.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, the publicly listed Japanese firm made a notable leap into bitcoin mining business last year with a $90 million spending budget to back explorations in the space, including chip making and its own mining farms. GMO‚Äôs mining facilities have been up running since the end of 2017 and, as per a report released earlier this month, the company has already mined 906 bitcoin and 537 bitcoin cash as of last month.\nWhilst the cost of production remains unknown, the total value of those mining rewards amounts to nearly $8 million based on the most recent CoinDesk prices. In the mean time, GMO is not the only one major technology firm planning to carve out a slice of the bitcoins mining industry by introducing more advanced mining chips. Notably, Samsung is also starting a risk production of 7nm chips in 2018, based on a report by CoinDesk in February. Additionally, GMO announced in October of last year that it‚Äôd sell its bitcoin mining equipment in 2018 through an initial coin offering. A representative told CoinDesk today that the company is still studying the idea, but couldn‚Äôt disclose more info because of the early stage of the plan. Bitcoin miner image via Shutterstock.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,270 on Bitfinex, down 6.5 percent in the last twenty four hours, and could extend the slide further to $7,000 in the next twenty four hours. The cryptocurrency closed (as per UTC) at $7,494 yesterday ‚Äì its lowest daily close since Apr 12 ‚Äì and looked oversold as per the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly and 4-hour chart. A resulting corrective rally ran information offers above $7,700 earlier today and prices fell to a 6-week low of $7,352 at 08:30 UTC. The failure on the portion of the bulls to produce a notable corrective rally despite oversold conditions suggests that bearish sentiment is currently strong. Hourly chart\nThe downside break of the bear flag, a bearish continuation pattern, indicates the minor corrective rally from the low of $7,402 has ended and BTC could drop to $7,000 (target as per the measured height method). The 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour moving averages (MAs) are biased to the bears. In the mean time, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped close to the oversold region (30.00), but is holding well above the lows seen yesterday, indicating there‚Äôs enough room for a drop to $7,000. Daily chart\nBTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in a convincing manner, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. Note that a break beneath the 61.8 percent Fib is widely considered a final confirmation of a bearish trend reversal. The chart also shows a bearish downside break of the falling channel, whilst the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, also in favor of the bears. The relative strength index is holding below 50.00 ‚Äì well above 30.00 (oversold zone), signaling scope for further losses. View\nBTC will likely find acceptance beneath the immediate support seen at $7,188 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement seen in the daily chart) and drop to the $7,000 mark in the next twenty four hours. By then, the RSI in the hourly and 4-hour chart will likely have dropped below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions, meaning BTC might defend the psychological support level of $7,000. On the higher side, only a daily close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $8,111, would abort the bearish view. Only a daily close above $8,644 (May 21 high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.\nChart image via Shutterstock\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:31:01.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ba42a742d4acb8110c55f57f9de1e8ac6f341c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7VszoLy3mGD1C46vYq0HlxrsMykh3xlbTPTyYvCSdcR2PepMdHpqWLerTJ.cjV0pfKFchjVgpuwei83Z9gDX6pyn8aLe6nlxHIi8ExwY2yPlYB8GqV1bl", "site_full": "biglawbusiness.com", "site": "biglawbusiness.com", "site_section": "https://biglawbusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "Big Law Business", "title": "Wake Up Call: New DOJ Probe Targets Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "Wake Up Call: New DOJ Probe Targets Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T14:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://biglawbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/323810045_1-13-e1527159620608.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ba42a742d4acb8110c55f57f9de1e8ac6f341c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7VszoLy3mGD1C46vYq0HlxrsMykh3xlbTPTyYvCSdcR2PepMdHpqWLerTJ.cjV0pfKFchjVgpuwei83Z9gDX6pyn8aLe6nlxHIi8ExwY2yPlYB8GqV1bl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rick Mitchell", "published": "2018-05-24T14:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wake Up Call: New DOJ Probe Targets Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "By Rick Mitchell - Big Law Business May 24, 2018 ‚Ä¢ The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, in a move said to dramatically increase U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets prone to misconduct.

"Bitcoin markets are under a bearish market sentiment with prices undergoing strong selling pressure. Today‚Äôs trading session had traders experience major breaches in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, with prices continuing to be following a downward spiral. The day‚Äôs signals Bitcoin markets continue experiencing breach after breach with no sign of support being present. BTC/USD levels now reach USD 7,300 price levels only a day after USD 8,000 price levels were breached. Markets aren‚Äôt appearing to take much consideration for positive price movements. Resistance appears to be bringing selling pressure even after price falls.\nGDAX BTC/USD charts are showcasing the disdain traders have towards any and all positive movements. The market‚Äôs sentiment has worsened considerably, and traders don‚Äôt seem to think twice when giving in to selling pressure. Large sell offs have dominated the day‚Äôs course, making up a significant portion of the day‚Äôs trading volumes in spite of the largest spikes happening momentarily. It‚Äôs no wonder that periods through which the most selling pressure was expressed accounted for the bigger chunk of the day‚Äôs trading volumes.\nOKEX BTC/USD weekly futures charts are showcasing how futures markets are pricing in for Bitcoin at lower prices than spot trades. This is a trend that was kept up throughout the day. Larger downward spikes continue being reflected with accuracy on futures markets. All that while futures markets appear to show hesitation when it comes to following. It is clear that the shift in the market‚Äôs sentiment has also lead to an overturn of the mood in futures markets.\nOverall, a very sharp shift in the market‚Äôs sentiment is now being embraced by traders. Bitcoin markets are struggling to maintain any level of support that could prove viable with each bearish breakout followed by another. Markets are not looking good with traders drifting away from the potential of a recovery.\nFor an improvement in the market‚Äôs outlook, a lot of liquidity would have to come in the form of support. The need for such moves becomes apparent in trading sessions like the more recent one. Lower trading volumes are known to leave markets susceptible to further breaches.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Bitcoin Price Analysis, 23rd May 2018: BTC/USD Dips Below $7,500 in Wake of Bearish Breakout appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is reportedly assisting the Justice Department with this probe. The investigation is set to look into practices like trade spoofing, or flooding, where fake orders are generated and cancelled to create the appearance of increased demand for specific cryptocurrencies. Other forms of illicit trading are also being investigated, like wash trades where traders trade with themselves to generate artificial market demand. These practices can be used to give buyers a false impression of activity, causing some to invest in cryptocurrencies. There have been claims that some traders have made $1 million spoof orders that are never executed.\nToday Bitcoin is worth $7,497.31, a $1000 reduction when compared to Sunday's value of $8500, showcasing the volatility of the cryptocurrency. Earlier today the currency was valued at $7,272, the lowest cost of the currency since April 12th. This investigation can be seen in one of two ways, depending on the outcome of the inquiry, if illegal market manipulation is found it will have a hugely negative impact on the cryptocurrency market, though if it isn't, it will act as legitimisation for the market, inviting further investment from financial analysts. The end of this investigation will likely bring with it regulations from the US government, who have already attempted to regulate ICOs (initial coin offerings) due to the sheer number of fraudulent groups who use them to take advantage of the cryptocurrency boom.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark campbell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:35:19.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af9dd6925cb732368fcde462d7689064a98389fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEhY.alMo27mEWASTOW3sEbPRaIRIflYOSI5t7Ci0MCid8ea7oEXUG9f7G5BqyPuykpt84n9rds8QENG5gS9Ypo6l6QJydEfNjQ-", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "https://redliontrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RedlionTrader", "title": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T14:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af9dd6925cb732368fcde462d7689064a98389fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEhY.alMo27mEWASTOW3sEbPRaIRIflYOSI5t7Ci0MCid8ea7oEXUG9f7G5BqyPuykpt84n9rds8QENG5gS9Ypo6l6QJydEfNjQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrTopStep", "published": "2018-05-24T14:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation", "text": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation Posted By: MrTopStep May 24, 2018\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into cryptocurrency price manipulation purported by market participants. In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to move lower towards the $7,000 line in an overall gloomy week for digital currencies. U.S. Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation Into Cryptocurrency Price Manipulation\nU.S. federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a criminal probe that focuses on price manipulation schemes, including spoofing ‚Äì a widely practiced form of price influence in which traders flood the market with fake orders in order to bait other players into taking the opposite side ‚Äì and wash trading, in which the cheater trades with themself to create a false impression of market demand and trading volume.\nExtreme market volatility and lack of regulatory oversight over trading platforms have led the justice system and financial watchdogs in the U.S. to worry over the cryptocurrency market and potential criminal market plays. China has cracked down on its cryptocurrency ecosystem , particularly Bitcoin miners, trading platforms, and digital currency payments solutions providers, over similar concerns, but also in order to keep its centralized financial system unchallenged.\nNew regulatory actions promoted in Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries, may have helped drown the price of Bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin came from its all-time highs in the $20,000 area only to be pulled down as the new year promised more government coordination regarding cryptocurrencies.\nGemini Trust , the New York-based digital asset exchange led by the Winklevoss twins, has recently hired Nasdaq Inc. to conduct surveillance of cryptocurrency trading on their platform. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have called for the creation of a self-regulatory body made up by trading platforms within the industry.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, many of which not even registered with the relevant financial watchdog. In the U.S., the CFTC is capable of imposing fines on spot market fraud even though the agency does not regulate it.\nJohn Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied cryptocurrency market manipulation told Bloomberg that limited oversight of digital currency trading makes it a target for crooks.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.‚Äù\nPrice manipulation within the cryptocurrency market, whether it is spoofing or wash trading, could break investor confidence in such a young niche trading asset. Market capitalization has been in decline since early May, having lost nearly $150 billion from those highs. Criminals engaging in such practices profit from market volatility and they may have a direct role in the current market sentiment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Justice Department opens investigation into illicit trading ‚Ä¢ Agency is working with CFTC, which oversees crypto futures\nThe Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices ‚Äî such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It‚Äôs down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading ‚Äî forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.‚Äôs latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise ‚Äî it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 ‚Äî has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That‚Äôs prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren‚Äôt registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn‚Äôt regulate what‚Äôs known as the spot market for digital tokens ‚Äî which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,‚Äù Griffin said. ‚ÄúIt would be easy to spoof this market.‚Äù\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry‚Äôs growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a ‚Äúbuyer beware‚Äù approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of ‚ÄúSpoofy,‚Äù a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matt Robinson in New York at mrobinson55@bloomberg.net; Tom Schoenberg in Washington at tschoenberg@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom schoenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:04:36.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "43e6a62a5b9b277ad850de6def4529ed79f2a38b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRZvEQGS_cqZLIYGLk1DvEI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Let's be honest bitcoin dies if the investors greed is not fulfilled", "title_full": "Let's be honest bitcoin dies if the investors greed is not fulfilled", "published": "2018-05-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "43e6a62a5b9b277ad850de6def4529ed79f2a38b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRZvEQGS_cqZLIYGLk1DvEI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KingScorpio", "published": "2018-05-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Let's be honest bitcoin dies if the investors greed is not fulfilled", "text": "many investors only invested into bitcoin because they hope for huge value increases, but since bitcoin is now stagnating and even losing in value,\ndue to the hart competition in the industry,\nmany will drop bitcoin and cointinue to drop it, because the ponzi scheme high returns at the beginning of bitcoins cannot be delivered anymore.\nregards", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:39:08.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a5e21c83965adcbe2dca6a12d355d33c610437d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Li6C11LwzgTQ24wVNE.AX.mSItqNkB4e0RdEMFm4BpFdifpBrrGmI4Nhv5vHL.3SGWrfQnMMNtpWVAFyWrViW4KBR5ymwO2aMDfgubz6F.t0M9Jzb3CZ4spQvjFP0.kCtXv9FnIe8mEoFgGTjJ2teGzzWyQDhc7WVySkgrsx4L9Q--", "site_full": "einvesting.com", "site": "einvesting.com", "site_section": "http://einvesting.com/forums/news-feeds.57/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "News Feeds | eInvesting.com - The Path to Smarter Investing", "title": "The US has reportedly opened a criminal probe into market manipulation of bitcoin and other...", "title_full": "The US has reportedly opened a criminal probe into market manipulation of bitcoin and other... | eInvesting.com - The Path to Smarter Investing", "published": "2018-05-24T13:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.688, "main_image": "http://einvesting.com/styles/cloud/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a5e21c83965adcbe2dca6a12d355d33c610437d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Li6C11LwzgTQ24wVNE.AX.mSItqNkB4e0RdEMFm4BpFdifpBrrGmI4Nhv5vHL.3SGWrfQnMMNtpWVAFyWrViW4KBR5ymwO2aMDfgubz6F.t0M9Jzb3CZ4spQvjFP0.kCtXv9FnIe8mEoFgGTjJ2teGzzWyQDhc7WVySkgrsx4L9Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oscar Williams-Grut", "published": "2018-05-24T13:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "The US has reportedly opened a criminal probe into market manipulation of bitcoin and other...", "text": "REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nThe US Justice Department and the CFTC are investigating spoofing and wash trading in cryptocurrency markets, according to Bloomberg.

The U.S. Government Has Opened a Criminal Probe REDPIXEL.PL/Shutterstock.com Get the latest federal technology news delivered to your inbox. email Justice\nThe U.S. Justice Department has started a criminal investigation into market manipulation of bitcoin prices, Bloomberg reported today . The probe will look for evidence of practices like spoofing and wash trading, both of which involve creating false orders to create the impression of genuine market activity, the report said, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the investigation.\nThe Justice Department‚Äôs probe will include other agencies, the sources said. It will work with the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which oversees bitcoin derivatives such as futures , and has declared that cryptocurrencies are commodities . Spot trading on cryptocurrency markets remains largely unregulated.\nThe CFTC has sent a subpoena to at least one cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, in recent months. The agency reportedly subpoenaed the exchange in December, Bloomberg reported at the time. It also sent a subpoena to Tether, a firm that issues a digital currency that is pegged in value to the U.S. dollar and which it claims is backed up by currency reserves. Tether‚Äôs claim, and its relationship with Bitfinex, is shrouded in mystery .\nTethers may have been used to manipulate the price of bitcoin. One theory is that the Tether token has propped up the price of bitcoin by as much as 40% during its historic rally last year. More prosaic price manipulation methods, such as faked orders, may also affect the bitcoin price. Such methods, known as wash trading, may make up over $3 billion of all the trading in cryptocurrency markets, one widely circulated analysis by a crypto trader has claimed. That means over 90% of the orders on one major exchange, OKEx, could be false, the analysis claims.\nIf traders are indeed capable of manipulating crypto prices, they may not have been at it recently. The price of bitcoin has fallen by 20% over the past month.

It's reportedly being conducted in tandem with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to bitcoin.\nThe price of bitcoin fell to $7,364 in the wake of Thursday's report from Bloomberg, from an overnight peak of $7,718. That's a decrease of 4.6 percent.\n29 28 things you didn't know you could buy with bitcoins The bitcoin market's meteoric rise and massive volatility has led some countries, including China, to ban the cryptocurrency, while others scramble to regulate it.
