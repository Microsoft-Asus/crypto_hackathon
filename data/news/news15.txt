So in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief we also feature a surefire way to make a quick fortune in cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center How to Make $120,000 in a Week\nAre you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon\nLedger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

"text": "#Blockchain Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Posted on by Startup365\nThe most important thing about bitcoin is the new freedom-enhancing innovations that the technology enables, but we know that’s not what everyone is looking for these days. So in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief we also feature a surefire way to make a quick fortune in cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center How to Make $120,000 in a Week\nAre you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon\nLedger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Most people involved in the world of blockchain these days are either straight-up crypto traders or financiers looking for the way of the future.\nHelp us make Finance Magnates better!\nPractical uses for blockchain technology have been a hot topic right along with the epic rise of cryptocurrency. Banks the world around have been discussing and conducting pilots and tests and everything in between; still, not many financial institutions have reached the point of actually adopting blockchain.\nHowever, there is one industry where blockchain has played an active role for years, and it’s probably not what you’re expecting.\nThe “[$97 billion] porn industry is definitely a leading indicator of technology adoption,” Litecoin creator Charlie Lee tweeted in mid-April. “I’m glad to see them opening up to cryptocurrency .” I think I was a bit too negative on this news. Wasnt trying to be. Anyways, congratulations to @justinvendetta and the Verge team. Porn industry is definitely a leading indicator of technology adoption. I’m glad to see them opening up to cryptocurrency.  https://t.co/lS9bekE3aS\n— Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) April 17, 2018\nLee was speaking PornHub’s announcement that the website now accepts Verge, a cryptocurrency noted for its anonymity. “Here at Pornhub, we’re all about convenience and security, which makes cryptocurrency an attractive form of payment for us,” PornHub VP Corey Price told Hard Fork. “We’ve been looking at crypto for quite some time and, while overall adoption is relatively low, we think it has gained enough steam for us to penetrate the market.”\nLee also expressed enthusiasm for PornHub to start accepting Litecoin. If you accept LTC, I will buy some just so that I can spend LTC to pay for porn. Deal? \n— Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) April 17, 2018\nThe truth is that while PornHub may have only gotten into the crypto game in April, cryptocurrency has played an important role in the adult entertainment and sex work industries for quite a long time.\nIndeed, “anyone who says crypto doesn’t have a real use case hasn’t been talking to sex workers,” wrote reporter Leigh Cullen in an article for CoinDesk. In fact, VIP Passion became the first escort service to accept Bitcoin all the way back in 2013.\nThe cryptocurrency and sex work industries began to intersect in a serious way back in 2015, when Visa and Mastercard pulled their services from Backpage , a site for personal ads that was often used by sex workers (the website has since been seized by the FBI ). At the time, both companies explained that the decision was made in an effort to end human trafficking .\nWhen the two major payment providers exited the site, sex workers who relied on Backpage to connect with clients were forced to switch to crypto; Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin became the only forms of payment that could be used on Backpage.\nThe sudden and forced switch to crypto led to an outpouring of support–the online community of sex workers and adult entertainers wrote guides on crypto usage by and for each other. “This is obviously an awful situation; many sex workers rely heavily on Backpage for their business,” wrote Liara Roux, a San Francisco-based escort in the introduction to one such guide. “While it would be wonderful to have a magic wand and fix this problem, bitcoin is one of the few payment methods still accepted by Backpage and I want to make sure those who need it can use it.” Do Bitcoin and Crypto Provide Payment Security for Sex Workers?\nWhile the initial switch to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may have required some technical knowhow, it can be argued that the change provided some benefits to sex workers and adult entertainers.\n“Most (nearly all) bitcoin services don’t care what you do for a living,” wrote Hobart-based escort The Lovely Corrine, in her Bitcoin guide for sex workers. “You can get paid for things that credit card processors won’t allow or charge a premium for.”\nIndeed, payment processors like PayPal and Square have restrictive policies that bar users from sending and receiving payments for anything related to adult industries, including sex toys, pornography, or subscription-based online adult communities.\nPayment companies “have systematically denied service and redlined the adult entertainment industry. They have routinely closed accounts of small businesses, artists and independent contractors whose business happens to be in the sex industry,” reads a blog post by cryptoeconomic-powered adult entertainment ecosystem SpankChain.\nCryptocurrency has also provided an avenue for sex workers to have more direct control over their money. “Having a bitcoin wallet would allow workers to have more control over their money,” reads a post by Bits and Chains. “Bitcoins and cryptocurrency would make it harder for pimps, and brothels, or the government to siphon off wages gained from prostitution.” The post also notes that Bitcoin has been a financial tool for the homeless population and other demographics who are not part of the “formal” economy for some time. Porn Sites Adopting Crypto\nNow that cryptocurrency seems to be an increasingly important part of the “formal” economy, the adult entertainment and sex work industries seem to be moving further towards the “formal” economy as well. Coincidence? Maybe, but the relationship between these “outcast” industries over the past several years only seems to make it more likely that they are (in some way) leapfrogging each other closer to the mainstream.\nAfter all, cryptocurrencies do offer consumers of adult media and services exactly what many of them are seeking: privacy.\n“Whether someone is trying to hide their purchases from a spouse, wants to avoid being part of a customer data hack (like Ashley Madison), or simply doesn’t feel comfortable giving their personal information to an adult website, cryptocurrencies can help,” wrote Killian McGrath, Co-Founder of Unhashed.com, in an exclusive email to Finance Magnates. “While Bitcoin provides pseudonymity , [which makes] it very difficult to find out what purchases someone has made, truly anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash make it impossible.”\nIndeed, the synergistic relationship between the blockchain and adult industries is evidenced by several recurring factors. For one, the fact that a growing number well-established adult entertainment companies and websites are adopting crypto payments.\nAlong with the partnership between PornHub and Verge, Playboy has announced the ‘Vice Industries Token’, which will power an ecosystem described as “a video entertainment platform where viewers can watch videos, and as a cryptocurrency where anybody who participates (in viewing, adding, or curating content) will get paid with VIT’s proprietary cryptocurrency.” A Growing Number of Adult Industry-Related Blockchain Projects\nAnother factor indicative of the strong relationship between the blockchain and adult industries is the growing number of blockchain projects that are centered directly around adult media and services.\nThere’s SpankChain, which has grown from a Reddit post by one ‘Spanktoshi Nakabooty’ to an 8-person team working “to solve common pain points endured by both sex workers and consumers of their work (you)” with blockchain technology.\nThere’s LiveStars, an Ethereum-based token that powers a blockchain adult streaming platform and social network.\nAnd there’s a whole, whole lot more (get ready for puns.)

I think it is only a matter of time before we continue downward. As you know that yesterday I had said that there is a little bit of a hammer, but I doubted that we are gonig to be able to get above 8,000. As long as we stay underneath there, it is likely that we will continue to sell-off and reach towards 6,000. A break above 8,000 would be very bullish. But right now, we just continue to drift lower. When you look at the long-term chart, we have clearly lower highs. So, I think it is only a matter of time before we test 6,000.\nBitcoin/JPY — As you can see, that I have some consolidation marked in the chart. But the last time we tried to rally, we failed, and that is why I think we are going back to the 700,000 level. It is more than likely we will probably try to break down through. At this point, it looks like from 700,000 to 1 million yen level, will continue to offer selling opportunities.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , technical analysis\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prabhu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T14:08:19.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13901f8ee635c6dd377c947389182c8e762001d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgQB5pn1yQDY1VFprR9NrKeMRjMp70pMaWM0Bzn0RRIfUuoYoKEwx9vXA29K6Gdpo13Xg12CCqB8B2XJklMkNMZxHKkfucfeJhQ--", "site_full": "www.thetradenews.com", "site": "thetradenews.com", "site_section": "https://www.thetradenews.com/rss.aspx?t=8589934659", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The TRADE", "title": "Bitcoin endorsement from SEC could provide a regulatory domino effect", "title_full": "Bitcoin endorsement from SEC could provide a regulatory domino effect", "published": "2018-06-07T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thetradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iStock-877508718-300x200.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13901f8ee635c6dd377c947389182c8e762001d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNhmZEbhKAgQB5pn1yQDY1VFprR9NrKeMRjMp70pMaWM0Bzn0RRIfUuoYoKEwx9vXA29K6Gdpo13Xg12CCqB8B2XJklMkNMZxHKkfucfeJhQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Watkins", "published": "2018-06-07T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin endorsement from SEC could provide a regulatory domino effect", "text": "June 7, 2018 12:13 PM GMT Bitcoin endorsement from SEC could provide a regulatory domino effect\nLack of clarity on the regulation of cryptocurrencies has proved to be a major barrier for institutional investors looking to trade digital assets. By\nInstitutional investors are waiting for regulatory approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before stepping into the cryptocurrency trading world, according to experts.\nA lack of clarity on the regulation of cryptocurrencies is one of the main barriers for fund managers venturing into the trading of the digital assets.\nRegulators across the world have publicly voiced their intentions to look into cryptocurrencies, with the SEC appointing an associate director this week to work on the application of US securities laws to Initial Coin Offerings and cryptocurrencies.\n“Why isn’t institutional investor money to flying into this space? It’s regulatory issues,” said Achim Illner, CEO at Global Crypto One, at the Cryptocurrency Fund Forum in London. “ Until there is clarity from the SEC nobody can make moves.\n“When they make a statement all the other guys in Europe will look at what the SEC decides and this will give them direction.”\nIn the SEC’s appointment of its new crypto director, the regulator described cryptocurrencies as a “dynamic area that has both promise and risk”.\nThe SEC’s regulatory counterpart, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has also been proactive, claiming earlier this year it is leading an international working group to build consensus and common ground with foreign authorities on cryptocurrency.\nIn the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been lauded by market participants for its openness and willingness to speak to the industry about regulating cryptocurrencies.\n“We can agree that some people are working on it and the SEC chairman said his daughter bought a Bitcoin so he is more positive,” added Illner.\n“I cannot imagine that they will bankrupt or let it die out because Wall Street is hungry for new things and it is not American to stop new things, so I am optimistic there will be a framework.”\nIllner’s comments came on the same day that SEC chairman Jay Clayton said in an interview with CNBC that cryptocurrencies such as blockchain are not securities.\n“We are waiting for the regulators to make a play at the moment the SEC hasn’t recognised cryptos or bitcoin as a security,” said Carl Kruger, head of operational due diligence at LumX Group.\n“As an asset class you can argue much so that bitcoin futures are an asset class, but bitcoin is not an asset class, because the two biggest regulators have not recognised them. Until that happens, we cannot say they are assets from a legal and compliance perspective.\n“There is this legend that they will become asset classes though, it is just a question of when.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "achim illner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T14:19:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06978c6257c1114a518a63a462b680a698d0e4a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz9CwQh31sR0WT9ctr8yhCxQ-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06978c6257c1114a518a63a462b680a698d0e4a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz9CwQh31sR0WT9ctr8yhCxQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T14:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 7, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Top Price Prediction: Upside targets after the Coinbase SEC news boost – Confluence ...

Weekly chart\nAs seen in the chart above, BTC narrowly avoided a downside (bearish) break of the narrowing price range last week, turning higher from $7,040. A bearish breakdown would have signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $19,891 and could have pushed BTC below $6,000 (February low).\nHowever, the subsequent rally to close to $7,700 has neutralized that threat. While it's still too early to say that bitcoin is now aiming for $8,880 (pennant resistance), the probability would rise sharply if we see an aggressive run above the significant resistance of the 50-week MA.\nSuch a move would invalidate the long-run bearish reversal indicated by the weekly close in the third week of May below the moving average. A move above the 50-week MA would also need to be backed by a solid rise in trading volumes to break out of the pennant.\nIn a promising sign for the bulls, the daily chart below shows that bitcoin is positioned for a convincing break above the 50-week moving average hurdle. Daily chart\nThe upside break of the falling channel seen earlier this week indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also biased to the bulls, as is the higher lows pattern indicated by the rising trendline.\nSo, a break above the immediate resistance at $7,780 (June 3 high) could yield a quisignificantck rally to over $8,000. The bullish move would also add credence to \" 6th of the month\" theory, which had hinted at a major bullish reversal based on an alternating monthly cycle. View BTC could rally to well over $8,000 in the next 24 hours or so if the resistance at $7,780 is breached. BTC looks set to close this week (Sunday's close as per UTC) above the 50-week MA of $7,819. In this case, the probability of a move higher towards pennant resistance of $8,880 would rise sharply. Bearish scenario : BTC could drop to pennant support at $7,080 if the bulls fail to capitalize on the positive setup seen in the daily chart and prices drop below $7,372 (June 5 low). A weekly close below$7,080 (downside break of the pennant pattern) could yield a sell-off below $6,000 (February low).\nPedestrian crossing sign image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/green-light-pedestrians-738432793?src=wGD5wnmKtgxn_qbpEKdaRw-2-5", "https://twitter.com/Thrillmex/status/1003960686731382784"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T16:22:52.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d518b3c7297d372e870b00619ab477d9a0d742b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNwhsyS8ZIHX9piug2OZBxw0RlhiQwS76GlA32wKXQWP3BS8R24GkdrpG5F1Ndy5I_LoWbOvLZGW5a75SX0Yx9SDVtpntrcUphOuATeR9rHrUvZikvu3IYKzbsr8xUjdM1LpxmXouh30ILR3xDgoTL_phTWfZYQ20NGIMvI71UgKXB_BpOEE63nx5sD.Sz7CEO0MIDueCAtPHRdP78MMifGE44cfZOCSAJI7QgKv7p7MoSB1DKm6PalGohZ.aTiOhznJH5OBasqmo-", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "https://redliontrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RedlionTrader", "title": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн", "title_full": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн", "published": "2018-06-07T14:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d518b3c7297d372e870b00619ab477d9a0d742b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNwhsyS8ZIHX9piug2OZBxw0RlhiQwS76GlA32wKXQWP3BS8R24GkdrpG5F1Ndy5I_LoWbOvLZGW5a75SX0Yx9SDVtpntrcUphOuATeR9rHrUvZikvu3IYKzbsr8xUjdM1LpxmXouh30ILR3xDgoTL_phTWfZYQ20NGIMvI71UgKXB_BpOEE63nx5sD.Sz7CEO0MIDueCAtPHRdP78MMifGE44cfZOCSAJI7QgKv7p7MoSB1DKm6PalGohZ.aTiOhznJH5OBasqmo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrTopStep", "published": "2018-06-07T14:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн", "text": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн\nThe addition of “биткоин” (bitcoin) to the Russian spelling dictionary is “well grounded,” according to an important official from the Institute of Russian Language – another recognition of the cryptocurrency. Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

As two of Wall Street’s highest-profile figures, the two billionaires penned a joint editorial in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, offering their take on why short-termism in the practice of revealing quarterly earnings among public companies is hurting the economy.\nAppearing in televised joint interview on CNBC that aired Thursday, both Dimon and Buffett were reminded of their widely-publicized criticisms of bitcoin.\n“You both have said some pretty nasty things about bitcoin recently,” the CNBC host said with subtlety, adding: “Which one of you hates bitcoin more?”\n“I set a high standard,” Berkshire Hathway Chairman and chief executive Warren Buffett said in response. The business magnate has delivered several withering criticisms in the past including calling bitcoin a ‘ real bubble ’, suggesting cryptocurrencies will see a “ bad ending ”, suggesting investing in bitcoin is akin to gambling and most infamous of all, calling bitcoin “ rat poison squared ” as recently as May. Warren Buffet has become one of bitcoin’s harshest critics. Source: Shutterstock\n“I don’t know whether Jamie can top me or not,” Buffett added.\nOffering his take, Dimon was more measured than his own previous critiques, stating:\n“I don’t want to be a bitcoin spokesman, you know. Just beware.”\nDimon has been a vocal critic of bitcoin for years, calling the cryptocurrency “ a waste of time ” in 2015 among other remarks that followed. In September 2017, Dimon notoriously labelled bitcoin ‘ a fraud’ , a statement the Wall Street banker has since come to regret .\nMeanwhile, JP Morgan’s own annual report filed with the SEC in 2017 revealed the bank privately acknowledges disruptive cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as a threat to its business model .\n“I’d fire them in a second,” Dimon publicly said of JP Morgan traders engaging in cryptocurrencies last year. “For two reasons. It’s against our rules and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous.”\nAs it turns out, JPMorgan has now tasked its FinTech programme head to formulate the bank’s crypto strategy, eight months on from Dimon’s ‘fraud’ warning.\nFeatured image from Flickr/Fortune.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/07/bitcoin-buyers-beware-jamie-dimon.html?play=1", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-termism-is-harming-the-economy-1528336801"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jp morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T19:56:25.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3191331e91c0b45bed3f20f6f34601adbf3ef465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vYzj.lAhV4fiUDop9rphSajBsrOJoWSDkduzWWeXqL4A_V4struP4g3EWPEQCyWA2Rl8K30tdub6KJaeK7SyiwUg2XiFaBaxfzXbT1pgOWbvfSryJJnunEB5wEfIjpE-", "site_full": "expressbusinessnewsblog.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://expressbusinessnewsblog.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Express Business News", "title": "Bitcoin price: Will BTC rise today?

been severely buffeted by many factors over the years. However, P2P finance platforms like Paxful recognize the opportunity cryptocurrency offers Africa.\nThe history of the African continent over the last few centuries hasn't been exactly ebullient. Colonialism, massive food shortages, the spread of a number of virulent diseases, armed conflict, and unstable economies have all been elements that have shaped the ongoing development of Africa.\nYet a new economic and technological force is offering an unprecedented opportunity for those living in the so-called Dark Continent: cryptocurrency. The growing popularity and use of Bitcoin in Africa is allowing people to take their economic destiny into their own hands, and P2P finance platforms like Paxful are an integral part of this ongoing revolution.\nTroubles Abound The vast natural resources of Africa were long exploited by numerous colonial powers. Eventually, those powers were forced to leave, but they left behind countries with very little in the way of infrastructure, a stable economy, and sound financial and educational systems. Civil strife between rival factions and natural disasters, such as crop failures, have only served to heighten the uncertainty that swirls across the continent.\nPeer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges in Africa understand that there many challenges facing Africans today. While inflation is manageable in a number of African countries, such as 2.71% in Zimbabwe and 3.6% in Namibia, inflation is rampant in many others, such as 12.48% in Nigeria , 18.7% in Libya, and an astounding 161.2% in South Sudan.\nThe result is that the average African is left helpless against economic, political, and military forces beyond their control. Fiat currency that is worth a set amount one day could be rendered worthless due to a change in regime. Banking institutions may curtail access to their services due to new laws being passed on the whim of a fickle central government. Yet such factors are actually conducive to the use of cryptocurrency being readily accepted and adopted by the average person. This is evident by the explosive growth in the popularity of Bitcoin in Africa .\nProviding Opportunities At its heart, cryptocurrency represents freedom for the average African. For far too long, many people across the continent have been subjugated politically or economically by some form of centralized authority. Exchanges like Paxful, however, realize that the P2P finance element of cryptocurrency is sweeping away this subjugation and allowing individuals to forge their own economic destiny.\nCryptocurrency only requires a few elements that allow people to be an active participant in its ecosystem – a smartphone, a Bitcoin wallet , and an internet connection. As the infrastructure of many African countries leave a lot to be desired, the use of smartphones has exploded.\nThe use of such devices has doubled over the last few years, and half of the continent's population has an active mobile phone subscription. People are now realizing that they no longer need access to a bank to be economically active. The millions of unbanked individuals in Africa can just pull out their smartphone to begin buying and selling in the crypto sphere.\nThe expanding use of Bitcoin in Nigeria and other nations highlights how people are realizing that cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for the entire continent of Africa. It is true that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have a degree of volatility, but they are often far less than what the fiat of the various African nations undergo. Cryptocurrency is proving to be a stable store of value for many Africans.\nNot to mention that they can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to transact business across national borders (as well as across the entire world) for extremely low costs and in a near-instantaneous manner. Instead of waiting days or weeks for a payment to go through via traditional financial institutions, with governments and banks slapping fees on every step of the journey, a person can use Bitcoin and their phone to complete the same process in a few minutes instead and for far cheaper.\nThe use of Bitcoin in Africa offers the opportunity of freedom. For one, it allows people to become part of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Individuals are no longer bound to their physical location's socio-economic features (as well as any attendant red tape) when it comes to making financial decisions. In another use, cryptocurrency helps provide physical freedom to Africans. If a person feels oppressed and has the ability to flee somewhere else, they can easily take their financial wealth with them if it's in the form of cryptocurrency. No longer is there the fear of a central bank closing its doors, not allowing account holders to gain access to their funds. A person can move across a border into a neighboring country and still be able to access their Bitcoin wallet .\nOverall, cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for Africa. People can use their mobile phone, Bitcoin wallet, and internet connection to instantly join the global P2P finance marketplace of cryptocurrency. Lack of institutional financial access, rampant inflation, and political instability are all muted through the use of cryptocurrency.\nWhether one lives in Nigeria , Kenya, or Ethiopia, virtual currencies represent economic freedom to a region that has known far too little of said commodity.

A new feature of batching will start to gather many transactions into a single transaction by adding numerous outputs per unit.

Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

Even higher, $ 8,301 , $ 8,396 , and $ 8,458 .\nOn the downside, strong support awaits at $ 7,627 which is the congestion of the Simple Moving Average 100-1h, the one-week high, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, and the SMA 5-1d. Further down, the $ 7,412 price level is the convergence of the Bolinger Band 1h-Lower, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week, and the Pivot Point one-day Support 2.\nHere is how it looks on the tool:\nThe Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\nThis tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.

However, P2P finance platforms like Paxful recognize the opportunity cryptocurrency offers Africa.\nThe history of the African continent over the last few centuries hasn’t been exactly ebullient. Colonialism, massive food shortages, the spread of a number of virulent diseases, armed conflict, and unstable economies have all been elements that have shaped the ongoing development of Africa.\nYet a new economic and technological force is offering an unprecedented opportunity for those living in the so-called Dark Continent: cryptocurrency. The growing popularity and use of Bitcoin in Africa is allowing people to take their economic destiny into their own hands, and P2P finance platforms like Paxful are an integral part of this ongoing revolution. Troubles Abound\nThe vast natural resources of Africa were long exploited by numerous colonial powers. Eventually, those powers were forced to leave, but they left behind countries with very little in the way of infrastructure, a stable economy, and sound financial and educational systems. Civil strife between rival factions and natural disasters, such as crop failures, have only served to heighten the uncertainty that swirls across the continent.\nPeer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges in Africa understand that there many challenges facing Africans today. While inflation is manageable in a number of African countries, such as 2.71% in Zimbabwe and 3.6% in Namibia, inflation is rampant in many others, such as 12.48% in Nigeria , 18.7% in Libya, and an astounding 161.2% in South Sudan.\nThe result is that the average African is left helpless against economic, political, and military forces beyond their control. Fiat currency that is worth a set amount one day could be rendered worthless due to a change in regime. Banking institutions may curtail access to their services due to new laws being passed on the whim of a fickle central government. Yet such factors are actually conducive to the use of cryptocurrency being readily accepted and adopted by the average person. This is evident by the explosive growth in the popularity of Bitcoin in Africa . Providing Opportunities\nAt its heart, cryptocurrency represents freedom for the average African. For far too long, many people across the continent have been subjugated politically or economically by some form of centralized authority. Exchanges like Paxful, however, realize that the P2P finance element of cryptocurrency is sweeping away this subjugation and allowing individuals to forge their own economic destiny.\nCryptocurrency only requires a few elements that allow people to be an active participant in its ecosystem – a smartphone, a Bitcoin wallet , and an internet connection. As the infrastructure of many African countries leave a lot to be desired, the use of smartphones has exploded.\nThe use of such devices has doubled over the last few years, and half of the continent’s population has an active mobile phone subscription. People are now realizing that they no longer need access to a bank to be economically active. The millions of unbanked individuals in Africa can just pull out their smartphone to begin buying and selling in the crypto sphere.\nThe expanding use of Bitcoin in Nigeria and other nations highlights how people are realizing that cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for the entire continent of Africa. It is true that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have a degree of volatility, but they are often far less than what the fiat of the various African nations undergo. Cryptocurrency is proving to be a stable store of value for many Africans.\nNot to mention that they can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to transact business across national borders (as well as across the entire world) for extremely low costs and in a near-instantaneous manner. Instead of waiting days or weeks for a payment to go through via traditional financial institutions, with governments and banks slapping fees on every step of the journey, a person can use Bitcoin and their phone to complete the same process in a few minutes instead and for far cheaper.\nThe use of Bitcoin in Africa offers the opportunity of freedom. For one, it allows people to become part of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Individuals are no longer bound to their physical location’s socio-economic features (as well as any attendant red tape) when it comes to making financial decisions. In another use, cryptocurrency helps provide physical freedom to Africans. If a person feels oppressed and has the ability to flee somewhere else, they can easily take their financial wealth with them if it’s in the form of cryptocurrency. No longer is there the fear of a central bank closing its doors, not allowing account holders to gain access to their funds. A person can move across a border into a neighboring country and still be able to access their Bitcoin wallet .\nOverall, cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for Africa. People can use their mobile phone, Bitcoin wallet, and internet connection to instantly join the global P2P finance marketplace of cryptocurrency. Lack of institutional financial access, rampant inflation, and political instability are all muted through the use of cryptocurrency.\nWhether one lives in Nigeria , Kenya, or Ethiopia, virtual currencies represent economic freedom to a region that has known far too little of said commodity. Virtual currency exchanges like Paxful understand the transformative power of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is having upon the continent.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://paxful.com/", "https://paxful.com/bitcoin-wallet", "https://paxful.com/buy-sell-bitcoin-nigeria", "http://bitcoinist.com/p2p-exchange-paxful-believes-africa-poised-become-next-big-bitcoin-market/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:18:13.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e59b75a3710bc53324bfa8d495b1ba9dc7b72a90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCW4gqSXYKqnR3K9BwMwA7ALiwV9TS5mumx4CYwn3W5UjaMUEL0TGvdHrxIB6rWyTvtLCZ6FsCyF6AABGlVCqPWg--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "The Future of Bitcoin: What Lightning Could Look Like", "title_full": "The Future of Bitcoin: What Lightning Could Look Like", "published": "2018-06-07T13:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1528340885_52176968.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e59b75a3710bc53324bfa8d495b1ba9dc7b72a90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCW4gqSXYKqnR3K9BwMwA7ALiwV9TS5mumx4CYwn3W5UjaMUEL0TGvdHrxIB6rWyTvtLCZ6FsCyF6AABGlVCqPWg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T13:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Future of Bitcoin: What Lightning Could Look Like", "text": "5 hours ago Bitcoin Technology Bitcoin Magazine 50 After years of conceptualization and development , the first Lightning implementations are now in beta . As a result, more nodes are appearing online every day, a growing number of users are opening channels with one another, and some merchants even started to accept Lightning payments. But of course, these are still the very early days of the Lightning Network . While the main implementations are usable and some wallets and other applications are available, Bitcoinu2019s overlay payment network is projected to improve over the next few years in areas ranging from network architecture to security and usability, and more. These are some of the more important Lightning projects currently in development. Dual-Funded Channels The Lightning Network consists of a series of payment channels. Each payment channel exists between two users, allowing funds to be sent back and forth between them. However, in this early stage of development, payment channels can only be funded by one of the two parties. The funding party must first make a transaction to his counterparty; only then can that counterparty return a payment within the same payment channel. The Lightning Network white paper , however, proposed dual-funded channels, for which a specification proposal has now also been made by ACINQ , the company behind eclair . As the name suggests, dual-funded channels will let both users partly fund a payment channel by each depositing some bitcoin. This should bring more flexibility to the Lightning user experience, as users can immediately send as well as receive payment after having opened a channel. Submarine Swaps In order to make a Lightning payment, users must deposit funds in a Lightning channel. Once in a channel, these funds cannot be sent to regular (on-chain) Bitcoin addresses (unless the channel is first closed). This means that bitcoin in a Lightning channel is somewhat separated from bitcoin in a regular wallet, not unlike how money in a checking account is somewhat separated from money in a savings account. But there are solutions to make switching between Lightning and on-chain payments more seamless. One solution is Submarine Swaps . Developed by Alex Bosworth (but conceptualized by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun even before that ), Submarine Swaps essentially let users send Lightning payments to a middleman on the Lightning Network; that middleman will send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a regular (on-chain) Bitcoin address. It also works the other way around: users can send regular on-chain payments to the middleman; that middleman will then send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a receiving Lightning node on the Lightning Network. Importantly, with Submarine Swaps, this conversion is done u201catomically.u201d Using a trick that is already embedded in the Lightning Network, the Lightning payment and the on-chain payment can effectively be linked to each other. This makes it impossible for the middleman to steal funds by not forwarding the payment. (In agreement with the users, he could charge a small fee for his service.) Splicing Another solution to make the Lightning user experience more seamless is called u201csplicing.u201d In essence, splicing would let a user u201ctop upu201d funds in an existing Lightning channel, or u201cdrainu201d funds from it, potentially while keeping the channel open. The idea is simple. Any Lightning channel starts with an opening transaction, which ensures that both users consent to moving the funds in the channel. The rest of the Lightning channel consists of a series of subsequent transactions exchanged between the users, which arenu2019t usually broadcast to the Bitcoin network. The funds in the opening transaction donu2019t move until the channel is closed. When u201csplicing in,u201d users take the opening transaction to instead send funds to a replacement opening transaction, which includes more bitcoin, from one or both users. Once this new opening transaction confirms on the blockchain, the channel is topped up. Until the new opening transaction is confirmed, the two users can simply update both the old and the new channel at the same time to avoid any u201cchannel downtime.u201d Conversely, when they u201csplice out,u201d users take the opening transaction to send funds to a regular (on-chain) address, and potentially keep some of it in the channel using the same trick. This way, users can make on-chain transactions straight out of a Lightning channel. Eltoo Each time a new payment is made, Lightning channels between users are updated to reflect their mutual balances. The trick used to accomplish this currently includes a penalty for users who try to cheat by broadcasting an older balance (presumably because that older balance would pay them more). Cheating users can lose all the funds they have in a channel. The problem is that the broadcasting of old balances is not always a cheating attempt. There are a number of scenarios in which users can accidentally broadcast an older balance; for example, because of a software bug or a backup gone wrong. In such scenarios, a complete loss of channel funds is quite a heavy punishment. First published on April 30, 2018, eltoo is the newest proposal featured in this article. u00a0Developed by Blockstreamu2019s c-lightning development team u2014 Dr. Christian Decker and Rusty Russell u2014 and Lightning Labsu2019 Osuntokun, eltoo updates a channel by building a chain of time-locked transactions, where each transaction spends funds from the previous one to reflect the latest channel balance. If one user broadcasts an older transaction (representing an older channel balance), her counterparty has some time to broadcast the latest transaction (representing the latest channel balance). A solution like this could work today, but it isnu2019t practical in cases of failure. It would require that the entire chain of transactions be broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, more or less defeating the purpose of the Lightning Network. Decker therefore proposed a soft-fork change to the Bitcoin protocol to introduce a type of hierarchy in these types of transactions: any newer transaction can override any older transaction without requiring that all transactions in the entire chain be broadcast. If this soft fork is adopted and activated on the Bitcoin network, Lightning users could create channels in both the current style and by using eltoo, depending on what they prefer. Compact Client-Side Block Filtering While the Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is still relevant for Lightning users for security purposes. Specifically, Lightning users must keep an eye on the blockchain to see if specific transactions are included. This can be resource intensive, in particular for mobile users. A solution for this is called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and was described in the Bitcoin white paper. Current SPV wallets use a trick called u201c Bloom filters u201d to find out whether any relevant transactions happened. Unfortunately, Bloom filters are rather privacy-unfriendly, as wallets essentially reveal all of their addresses to nodes on the Bitcoin network. They also have some scaling and usability issues, as each individual SPV wallet takes up resources from at least one full Bitcoin node. To tackle these issues, Lightning Labsu2019 Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, designed a new solution called u201ccompact client-side block filtering,u201d which they are implementing in the Neutrino wallet. Compact client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use. Instead of wallets requesting transactions relevant to them by creating and sending out a Bloom filter to full nodes, full nodes create a filter for all Neutrino wallets. The Neutrino wallet then uses this filter to establish that the relevant transaction did not happen u2014 which is really all that users need to know to be sure they are not being cheated. (If the filter produces a match, Neutrino fetches the relevant block to see if the match really concerns the exact transaction instead of a false positive.) Interestingly, while this trick was designed with the Lightning experience in mind, it could be utilized to benefit regular light wallets as well. Watchtowers To avoid being cheated, Lightning users must keep track of potential on-chain transactions that could be relevant to them. While compact client-side block filtering should make things much easier, users do need to u201ccheck inu201d once in a while to make sure theyu2019re not being cheated. If they forget to check, it creates a security risk. u201cWatchtowersu201d are a potential solution that can be traced back to the Lightning Network white paper and has since been improved by Lightning Network white paper co-author and lit developer Tadge Dryja and others. As the name suggests, Watchtowers could let users outsource blockchain monitoring to third parties. Current Watchtower designs are not set in stone but would roughly work like this. Whenever users update a channel, they send a small data package to a Watchtower. The first part of this package is a u201chintu201d of a transaction they should look out for, as if it were a piece of a puzzle. This hint alone doesnu2019t reveal anything about the content of the transaction that the Watchtower must look out for; users donu2019t give up any privacy in this sense. However, if the relevant transaction shows up in the Bitcoin blockchain, the Watchtower can use the hint to recognize it. Then, with the transaction data on the blockchain itself, the Watchtower can use the second part of the package theyu2019ve received to reconstruct the penalty transaction. This penalty transaction sends all funds in the channel to the user that is being cheated. (Or in the case of eltoo, it just broadcasts the correct channel balance.) The penalty transaction can also be designed to let the Watchtower claim part of the funds as a reward, as an incentive to do its job. Users can outsource channel monitoring to multiple Watchtowers. Even if one fails, another might not, limiting the risk for Lightning users to the point where itu2019s arguably negligible. Atomic Multi-Path Payments What makes the Lightning Network a network is that the payment channels between users are interconnected. Users can pay across payment channels, through peers on the network that act as u201cmiddlemen,u201d to users they donu2019t have a direct channel open with. However, right now a single payment must be routed over a single route. If one user wants to pay 5 mBTC to another, not only must he have 5 mBTC in a single channel, all the middlemen on the route must also have 5 mBTC ready in a channel to forward. The bigger a payment is, the smaller the odds of this being the case. Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMPs) could go a long way of solving this limitation. First proposed by Lightning Labsu2019 Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht, the idea is simple: Larger payments can be u201ccut upu201d into smaller pieces, all of which have their own route from the payer to the payee, through different middlemen. A challenge to realize this solution is that Lightning payments can fail, which would in this case mean that a payment is made partially. Partial payments can easily be a bigger problem than no payment at all, however: a merchant wonu2019t be satisfied with a partial payment, while a customer wonu2019t be happy spending any money for nothing. The solution to this problem is that AMPs use an extension to the hash time-locked contracts , which are already used along Lightning routes and involve passing secret data along a network. Using a trick similar to the one used by deterministic wallets (which generate multiple Bitcoin addresses from a single seed), the smaller pieces of a larger payment can only be redeemed by the payee if all of them are: if some secret data doesnu2019t make it through the route whole, the entire payment fails. Atomic Swaps The Lightning Network is designed as a scaling layer for Bitcoin. But since many altcoins are software forks of Bitcoinu2019s codebase(s), itu2019s often not difficult to create similar scaling layers for these altcoins. Already, a small Litecoin Lightning Network exists, and more Lightning Networks are likely to follow. Interestingly, these networks donu2019t need to remain separated in the future. Using a fundamental building block of the Lightning Network called u201catomic swapsu201d (first proposed by Tier Nolan and realized on Lightning by Lightning Labsu2019 Fromknecht), payment channels can be linked across different blockchains. In other words, a user can send bitcoin, and as long as a node on the network is willing to make the exchange, another user can receive the payment as litecoin. Of course, this also means that users can send such payments to themselves: they can send bitcoin and receive litecoin. In effect, the Lightning Network could establish a network of trustless cryptocurrency exchanges. For more information on this topic, see: u201c Atomic Swaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins .u201d Channel Factories The main benefit of the Lightning Network is arguably its potential to vastly increase the upper limit of bitcoin transactions without burdening the Bitcoin network. As long as two users both have funds in their channel, they can pay each other a virtually unlimited number of times, while only requiring two on-chain transactions: one to open a payment channel and one to close it. Still, two transactions per payment channel could add up if Bitcoin and the Lightning Network gain more adoption over time. A proposal by ETH Zurich researchers Christian Decker (also of Blockstream), Roger Wattenhofer and Conrad Burchert called u201cChannel Factoriesu201d could further decrease the average number of on-chain transactions required per payment channel, perhaps significantly. Loosely based on an earlier Lightning-like proposal by Decker and Wattenhofer from 2015, Channel Factories are a type of payment channel that can exist among many users. Meanwhile, like any payment channel, a Channel Factory only ever requires two on-chain transactions. (If Schnorr signatures are implemented on Bitcoin, these transactions could be quite compact, even if it involves many users.) The Channel Factories can, in turn, act sort of like u201csub-channelsu201d for the Lightning Network. Participants within a Channel Factory can open and close a virtually unlimited number of Lightning channels with each other, without requiring any additional on-chain transactions. By doing so, they could, in theory, bring the number of required on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network down by a magnitude. For more information on this topic, see: u201c This New Scaling Layer Could Make Payment Channels Ten Times More Effective u201d.

The campaign will comprise a minivan boldly donning the bitcoin logo embarking on a road trip across Argentina and Latin America with the goal of spreading knowledge and fostering bitcoin adoption. Also Read: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Drowning in Tokens Latin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign Non-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ‘ Bitcoineta ‘– a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption. The tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America. The project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, “It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.” The two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films. Sowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption The Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba. Julian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, “The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.” Do you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

ETH/USD dropped sharply below $600 before finding a support area at the 61.8% Fib retracement level with the previous swing high of $625 and a $577 low.

The region at $616 will be a hurdle as the price recoils towards $620. On the downside, Ethereum price has been supported by the 23.6% Fib retracement level with the last swing high of $625 and a low of $577.

However, P2P finance platforms like Paxful recognize the opportunity cryptocurrency offers Africa.\nThe history of the African continent over the last few centuries hasn’t been exactly ebullient. Colonialism, massive food shortages, the spread of a number of virulent diseases, armed conflict, and unstable economies have all been elements that have shaped the ongoing development of Africa.\nYet a new economic and technological force is offering an unprecedented opportunity for those living in the so-called Dark Continent: cryptocurrency. The growing popularity and use of Bitcoin in Africa is allowing people to take their economic destiny into their own hands, and P2P finance platforms like Paxful are an integral part of this ongoing revolution. Troubles Abound\nThe vast natural resources of Africa were long exploited by numerous colonial powers. Eventually, those powers were forced to leave, but they left behind countries with very little in the way of infrastructure, a stable economy, and sound financial and educational systems. Civil strife between rival factions and natural disasters, such as crop failures, have only served to heighten the uncertainty that swirls across the continent.\nPeer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges in Africa understand that there many challenges facing Africans today. While inflation is manageable in a number of African countries, such as 2.71% in Zimbabwe and 3.6% in Namibia, inflation is rampant in many others, such as 12.48% in Nigeria , 18.7% in Libya, and an astounding 161.2% in South Sudan.\nThe result is that the average African is left helpless against economic, political, and military forces beyond their control. Fiat currency that is worth a set amount one day could be rendered worthless due to a change in regime. Banking institutions may curtail access to their services due to new laws being passed on the whim of a fickle central government. Yet such factors are actually conducive to the use of cryptocurrency being readily accepted and adopted by the average person. This is evident by the explosive growth in the popularity of Bitcoin in Africa . Providing Opportunities\nAt its heart, cryptocurrency represents freedom for the average African. For far too long, many people across the continent have been subjugated politically or economically by some form of centralized authority. Exchanges like Paxful, however, realize that the P2P finance element of cryptocurrency is sweeping away this subjugation and allowing individuals to forge their own economic destiny.\nCryptocurrency only requires a few elements that allow people to be an active participant in its ecosystem – a smartphone, a Bitcoin wallet , and an internet connection. As the infrastructure of many African countries leave a lot to be desired, the use of smartphones has exploded.\nThe use of such devices has doubled over the last few years, and half of the continent’s population has an active mobile phone subscription. People are now realizing that they no longer need access to a bank to be economically active. The millions of unbanked individuals in Africa can just pull out their smartphone to begin buying and selling in the crypto sphere.\nThe expanding use of Bitcoin in Nigeria and other nations highlights how people are realizing that cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for the entire continent of Africa. It is true that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have a degree of volatility, but they are often far less than what the fiat of the various African nations undergo. Cryptocurrency is proving to be a stable store of value for many Africans.\nNot to mention that they can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to transact business across national borders (as well as across the entire world) for extremely low costs and in a near-instantaneous manner. Instead of waiting days or weeks for a payment to go through via traditional financial institutions, with governments and banks slapping fees on every step of the journey, a person can use Bitcoin and their phone to complete the same process in a few minutes instead and for far cheaper.\nThe use of Bitcoin in Africa offers the opportunity of freedom. For one, it allows people to become part of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Individuals are no longer bound to their physical location’s socio-economic features (as well as any attendant red tape) when it comes to making financial decisions. In another use, cryptocurrency helps provide physical freedom to Africans. If a person feels oppressed and has the ability to flee somewhere else, they can easily take their financial wealth with them if it’s in the form of cryptocurrency. No longer is there the fear of a central bank closing its doors, not allowing account holders to gain access to their funds. A person can move across a border into a neighboring country and still be able to access their Bitcoin wallet .\nOverall, cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for Africa. People can use their mobile phone, Bitcoin wallet, and internet connection to instantly join the global P2P finance marketplace of cryptocurrency. Lack of institutional financial access, rampant inflation, and political instability are all muted through the use of cryptocurrency.\nWhether one lives in Nigeria , Kenya, or Ethiopia, virtual currencies represent economic freedom to a region that has known far too little of said commodity. Virtual currency exchanges like Paxful understand the transformative power of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is having upon the continent.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://paxful.com/", "https://paxful.com/bitcoin-wallet", "https://paxful.com/buy-sell-bitcoin-nigeria"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:38:26.068+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc35abf564b20074faad7e6c39a8a7a7a66d4af5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2wVwv1GOz6Msy5xK737ZFasrth5CkF_tVqK8QMl5cTqxRevWBbJl2arYIyWb4NFlin1HtyMGziYq3ZDbXOcyqpfxbuBvKg6uxN6xxQne3XonJ52v2muTIC.GNSdDGE95tR0rzKRoYtw--", "site_full": "www.bloomberg.com", "site": "bloomberg.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Will Hit $25K by End of Year, Fundstrat's Lee Says – Bloomberg", "title_full": "Bitcoin Will Hit $25K by End of Year, Fundstrat's Lee Says – Bloomberg", "published": "2018-06-07T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.248, "main_image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/in7pLo0nsJ8I/v5/-1x-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 356, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc35abf564b20074faad7e6c39a8a7a7a66d4af5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2wVwv1GOz6Msy5xK737ZFasrth5CkF_tVqK8QMl5cTqxRevWBbJl2arYIyWb4NFlin1HtyMGziYq3ZDbXOcyqpfxbuBvKg6uxN6xxQne3XonJ52v2muTIC.GNSdDGE95tR0rzKRoYtw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msn.com", "published": "2018-06-07T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Will Hit $25K by End of Year, Fundstrat's Lee Says – Bloomberg", "text": "Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner, discusses the outlook for cryptocurrencies with Bloomberg's Scarlet Fu and Julie Hyman on \"Bloomberg Markets.\" (Source: Bloomberg)\"> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "julie hyman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarlet fu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg markets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T08:47:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19c2d29ac97518c2875915a79941d0b730f97fc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcDXTc7RaCvr1qjbSuqV3P5tH57MFrk12BpDkhqoCvi7rasoRSwJQbBDbMa15pIrHsxJqR3Chsszhv5SmeQ8rb", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "http://seekingalpha.com/by/type/market-outlook/feed", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Stock Market Outlook from Seeking Alpha", "title": "Is Bitcoin The New Volatility Gauge?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin The New Volatility Gauge? | Seeking Alpha", "published": "2018-06-07T12:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/7/saupload_stutland_thumb1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1432, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19c2d29ac97518c2875915a79941d0b730f97fc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcDXTc7RaCvr1qjbSuqV3P5tH57MFrk12BpDkhqoCvi7rasoRSwJQbBDbMa15pIrHsxJqR3Chsszhv5SmeQ8rb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeff Malec", "published": "2018-06-07T12:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin The New Volatility Gauge?", "text": "\"Bitcoin is becoming the new VIX,\" said Brian Stutland, President of Equity Armor Investments on CNBC's Options Action segment as the markets were taking a tumble last week. His evidence? The very short 6-month window showing the correlation between the VIX Index and Bitcoin, as well as the assumption that investors that are pulling their money out of the market and putting it into Bitcoin:\n\"If you want to know what the market is going in the next 30 days, look at what bitcoin did 30 days ago. When we overlay the two together, there is huge correlation between VIX and Bitcoin 30 days ago.\nBitcoin is a way for investors to move money off the balance sheet of banks and into their own wallet. Essentially, they are storing them money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency. You're worried banks are going to have some sort of credit risk. As credit risk increase, we get more volatility.\"\nIs it that investors are actually taking money out of the market (pushing stocks down and VIX up) and into Bitcoin (pushing Bitcoin up), or is it that Bitcoin has marketed itself as the antithesis of markets and every chink in the armor of the establishment (markets) is a feather in the cap for the anti-establishment (Bitcoin)?\nOr is it that the blue squiggly line just happens to overlap the red squiggly line (with a 30-day lag) in a purely coincidental curiosity? We'll take the latter. Just consider the following MarketWatch chart from this Josh Brown blog post showing the high correlation between the Dow \"now\" and before the great market crash of 1929.\nScary indeed... but now look back at the fine print on the X-axis. That's the 2012-2014 period... not now. Updating that chart with current data would show we're up several trillions of dollars in market cap, or about 73%, since then. Jeff Bezos himself has made more money since the end of that chart than probably 90% of all of humanity has made in the entirety of the world before that time. So, color us a bit skeptical that Bitcoin and VIX lining up for a short stint mean anything significant.\nDisclaimer\nThe performance data displayed herein is compiled from various sources, including BarclayHedge, RCM's own estimates of performance based on account managed by advisors on its books, and reports directly from the advisors.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

That wild eyed bull that had been away, has reappeared as Bitcoin price just broke $7,700! Question is, will the bears go quietly or will BTC continue trading sideways as the bears maul it into submission?\nMarket Overview It's in tumultuous times such as these that investors should just kick back and relax. Take a deep breath, read a book, binge watch Netflix or just listen to Thin Lizzy as we at Bitcoinist love to do…hence the not so subtle mash up of the Thin Lizzy's chorus in the title.\nBitcoin had been doing so well, climbing past $7,500 USD late last week and the move toward $7,700 was especially pleasant. For a moment, it almost appeared that McAfee's prediction was coming true before our eyes, then with one fell swoop bitcoin price collapsed and it looks like we're going back under $7,500 again.\nAnyhow, let's get to it and see what's happening with bitcoin.\nDaily Chart\nOn June 4th, BTC dropped from the ascending wedge, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change as the cryptocurrency failed to find footing above $7,500 and $7,650.\nFollowing the rising wedge breakdown, BTC nearly closed below $7,500 and the downtrend that started on May 5th continues as bears have mauled BTC back into the descending channel.\nAt the time of writing, BTC trades below the ascending wedge trendline, inside of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA well below the 50 and 100-day MA. The 100-day MA slopes downward, touching the 50-day MA at $8,482, which is a sign of bearish pressure.\nA glance at the the 1 hour chart (not pictured here) shows the 5 and 10-day MA crossed in steep descent and the RSI has fallen from 58 to 44 without any signs of a turn around. The Stoch also resides in overbought territory and appears to be reversing direction as the signal lines have crossed and begun to descend.\nThe general outlook portrays bears as having the advantage and a BTC close below $7,500 is likely to bring on further decline in BTC price.\n4HR Chart\nGenerally, the 4 hour chart is quite similar to the daily chart, except for the 5-day MA ever so slightly above the 10 and 50-Day MA, though at the time of writing the 5-day MA has also rounded down and is hiding behind that big red candle.\nThe 10-day MA is beginning to put some distance between itself and the 50-day MA by inching its way up toward the 5-day MA; and while this does not appear to be a period of consolidation, the slope upwards in combination with a series of doji candlesticks at least shows the presence of some bullish pressure as BTC struggles to overtake $7,600.\nBitcoin Price: Looking Ahead BTC will need to reach $7,850 in order for bulls to regain control.\nA close below the 50-day MA ($7,530) could see BTC drop to the nearest support at $7,365 and the absence of buyers could see the price drop as low as $7,200 – $7,000 again.\nAs suggested last week , if bears manage to retake control, BTC could re-enter the ascending wedge at $7,800 and in the event of high volume buying BTC could rise as high as the 50-day MA at $8,450 (daily chart). Traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of any upward movement.\nIn the meantime, it's safe to assume that the majority of buyers are waiting patiently on the sidelines and since it's good to always try and end things on a high note, we'll leave you with this…\nThe 12th of June is a mere 5 days away and in the event of a miscast prediction , the cryptocurrency community can at least look forward to McAfee's 2020 run for POTUS .\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

What about most ICOs today? That was the question posed by CNBC in an interview with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. In the interview, the chairman stated in no uncertain terms that currencies like bitcoin are not securities. However, a potentially large number of ICOs that are used to fund startup companies or represent ownership in a company in some way could very well be securities. What is a Security? 5 Many ICO’s Potentially Under the Gun\nThe definition of what a security is generally goes something like this. According to Investopedia , a security is “a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity’s bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.” For more information on cryptocurrencies and securities, read our article on the subject here SEC: Bitcoin Not a Security\nUnderstanding the definition of a security, it’s easy to understand why currencies like the US dollar or the Euro are not securities. This is because they do not represent ownership in a company, fund, or as a form of private or corporate debt.\nIf the SEC were to label bitcoin a security, this would have essentially devastating consequences on global trade as we know it. Bitcoin does not belong to, nor is it created by a single company, group, or issuer. It does not represent ownership in anything, and it does not represent that or obligations.\nIf the SEC were to label bitcoin a security, that would mean that they could even consider something like collectible Beanie Babies a security, which would be of course patently ridiculous.\nThe chairman was not, however, quite so friendly when it comes to the discussion of a number of ICOs that have gone live in the last few years. So what did he say exactly? SEC Versus ICOs\nCNBC’s Bob Pisani asked first if bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies were considered securities by the SEC. To this, Clayton said of bitcoin, “These are replacements for sovereign currencies, replace the dollar, the Yen, the Euro, with bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security.”\nBut what does count as a security? To answer that, Clayton continued: “A token, a digital asset or I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, you have some company you want to start… And in return for me giving you my money, you say you know what I’m going to give you a return, or you can get a return in the secondary market by selling your tokens to somebody, that is the security and we regulate that.”\nCNBC’s Bob Pisani then asked if Clayton does see most ICOs as securities, to which Clayton replied, “Correct”.\nPisani then asks if Clayton and the SEC are going to “make a clear statement” regarding the issue. To which Clayton responds, “I hope I just did. If it’s a security, we are regulating it. We’ve been doing this for a long time.”\nAccording to Clayton, the SEC is not against ICOs or using tokens as a concept. Instead he advised that anyone wanting to do so should talk to the SEC, file the paperwork, and do it legally. SEC Rules Have “No Need to Change”\nWhen asked about other assets like Ether and Ripple’s XRP, Clayton declined to comment. He said, that instead of worrying bout this specific asset or another, “you need to ask yourself, am I giving you money to fund your venture or am I relying on you and your colleagues” to succeed or make a profit.\nPisani then asked if the SEC rules or definitions need to change. To this, Clayton said in no uncertain terms that the laws and definitions put in place were enough. He continued, “We’ve been doing this a long time, and there’s no need to change our fundamental approach”\nThe topic then shifted to what is needed for a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency ETF, or exchange traded fund.\nClatyon said, that the SEC has “been clear on what we need for any type of asset class if we are going to approve a product. One of those things is, is the pricing something people can rely on? Also asset verification. Our communication to the marketplace on this has been very clear. I’m very pleased with my colleagues at the SEC because I think we’re very open about what we need for you to satisfy our rules.” Many ICO’s Potentially Under the Gun\nBased on the statements from Chairman Clayton, it’s easy to see how a large number of cryptocurrencies that had an ICO could be at risk of getting unwanted attention from the SEC.\nWhile we’re not going to comment on specific assets or companies, a number of cryptocurrencies have launched wherein their token sale proceeds were used to fund the creation of a company.\nA significant number of these companies do not exist in the US. For instance, many new ICO projects are launching out of Singapore or the European Union. As such, we do not know how the US SEC’s rules will affect these types of companies. It is possible that the SEC could declare these products as not suitable or even downright illegal for Americans or “US persons” to deal in. However, their ability to enforce this kind of action is currently uncertain, if not downright questionable given the nature of cryptocurrency and its borderless operations.\nWhat is good to know is that we now have a clear statement indicating that purely currency-type projects like bitcoin (and presumably others like Dash, Litecoin, and a few others) could very well be safe from the SEC. During the interview, Chairman Clayton only specifically referred to bitcoin saying that it is not a security. When asked about Ethereum, Clayton said that he would not comment on specific assets. 16 shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://my.sendinblue.com/users/subscribe/js_id/260w8/id/2/", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert devoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "investopedia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T13:33:13.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48252ca0dc46291bce56b39171bd64f254d8ef62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdLTAgLP2_inkDIoF.PU2v8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-07T12:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48252ca0dc46291bce56b39171bd64f254d8ef62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdLTAgLP2_inkDIoF.PU2v8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lexkiee28", "published": "2018-06-07T12:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "I start to invest in bitcoin 30 percent of my money and it will go back double to my investment so I earned in my first attempt in cryptocurrency I will never invest my whole money in crypto it because I have a daily needs to provide food, water, and bills to be paid monthly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T09:25:34.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a758c6dc26b9d6cc96e20e5ed52cb71c0ed29c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTbgpQ0JRvp.ROQ6PMzyDtk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "How does Bitcoin change the economy?", "title_full": "How does Bitcoin change the economy?", "published": "2018-06-07T12:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a758c6dc26b9d6cc96e20e5ed52cb71c0ed29c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTbgpQ0JRvp.ROQ6PMzyDtk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BulbaLord", "published": "2018-06-07T12:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "How does Bitcoin change the economy?", "text": "I think Bitcoin helped the countries indirectly how, just an example in our country there is a famous wallet called coins.ph and it is a company and of course it needs employees, employees and company pay taxes so I think thats how.

The situation changed in the afternoon, when Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop, which pulled its price toward the $7,500 mark. After spending several hours trading near that level, the digital cryptocurrency bounced back to finish the day in the positive territory. Bitcoin closed the session at $7,653.98, slightly higher than its opening level of $7,625.97.\nWhile the initial advance came to a halt near the end of the session, Bitcoin experienced another uptick in the early hours of today’s trading, which allowed it to move above the $7,700 level. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $7,700, having hit an intraday high of $7,741.27 earlier in the session.\nIn other Bitcoin news, Bloomberg reported yesterday that companies Van Eck Associates Corp and SolidX Partners had filed a joint request to list a Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator has previously rejected requests for exchange-traded funds, including requests from the same firms. In their new request Van Eck an SolidX have made several changes, which they hope would be enough to satisfy the regulator. The proposed fund will be physically-backed, meaning that it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency. The companies have also increased the share price and intend to base prices off regulated trading firms, Bloomberg reports.\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” SolidX chief executive officer Daniel H. Gallancy told the newswire in a phone interview. “We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.”\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,697.44, as of 10:25 BST.

Official currencies, like the dollar, benefit when things are wrong, because governments can impose their use and act as end-of-life creditors, Jim Chanos said in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Digital coins, on the contrary, do not have such support.\n“If you think you need to have digital coins to get you out in case the worst case scenario happens, then you know that a digital currency will have no value,” he said, adding: “The last thing I would like to have if the network dissapear is Bitcoin ‘.\nHe attributes the enthusiasm for Bitcoin last year and other cryptos in the “cycle of fraud” that occurs when markets are profitable for a long time. It is then that the world becomes less cautious and proceeds to investments that would normally look very good to be true.\nThe upward market of the 1990s peaked with accounting scandals, as in the case of Enron. Later, another rally led to the global financial crisis of 2008, he said.\n“Today we are in the ninth year of the last rising market, so I suspect that things are getting livelier,” he said.\nReferring to Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptobonds, he points out that it is very simple for a “speculative game” presented as a technological revolution at the level of monetary policy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris dunkan jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T12:46:26.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53014755c923be6ab671d6ed80c98ab4d9363437", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdgA23sAboRmjGqX6fBsyq.0-", "site_full": "siteownersforums.com", "site": "siteownersforums.com", "site_section": "http://siteownersforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=50", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trade Traffic - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "published": "2018-06-07T12:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53014755c923be6ab671d6ed80c98ab4d9363437", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdgA23sAboRmjGqX6fBsyq.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HelenShuth", "published": "2018-06-07T12:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW revolutional software complex for CAPTCHA's automatic solution\n1.

According to the Yale professor, Bitcoin could go extinct within the next 100 years. He is drawing parallels between the world’s leading cryptocurrency and the dinosaurs.\n“Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists,” Shiller said on CNBC’s Trading Nation. “There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.”\nEven though according to his statement, the end of cryptocurrency is far away, it does not mean that BTC will not suffer in the current market.\n“The one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when Bitcoin topped $1,000 and then lost 80% of its value. It looked like Bitcoin was just fading away,” he added. “It’s so hard to predict these things.”\nIn four years however things have completely changed. Last December, it hit a record price just short of $20,000. Weeks later, Bitcoin suffered a major hit— sinking to $6,400. It’s now trading in the low $7,000s and is still up 233% over the past 12 months.\n“It looks like a bubble,” according to Shiller. There is one thing though that Shiller likes about crypto-mania, which he has repeatedly dismissed, is the excitement and innovative spirit it has ignited.\n“It’s getting people enthusiastic, and people are making different kinds of cryptocurrencies,” he noted. “There are thousands of them now, so something good may come out of it.”\nShiller went on to say that he was amused when one of his economics students recently asked if he could keep his laptop on during his final exam so he could execute a cryptocurrency trade.\n“That’s a new first for me. That shows real enthusiasm,” Shiller laughed. “I said, ‘okay, if it’s so important to you, you can trade during the final exam.”\nRobert Shiller is one of three people who were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 for their work on spotting financial bubbles. Shiller is an admitted Bitcoin bear who has ridiculed the cryptocurrency market ever since it started garnering countless headlines.\nYou can read the original article on btcwires.com here .

CHOOSE PROTOCOLS & PLATFORMS (OVER DAPPS). The state of cryptocurrency is in flux with different blockchain platforms all vying for dominance. BTC, the first cryptocurrency, itself is outdated. It does not support smart contracts, it’s slow, it’s expensive, and there’s a vicious civil war between the core developers who task themselves with improving the BTC infrastructure and the large mining companies & businesses with a vested interested in making as much money as they can from it. But the siren call of blockchain is strong. Some of the smartest people are promising that blockchain can optimize (through decentralization) many inefficient systems present in banking, government, supply chain, insurance, and many other broad areas. The real winner in a few years may not be Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other specific coin but Blockchain technology and how it disrupts our current technology. There is a mad scramble to find the blockchain /s that come out on top. The blockchain/s that prove they are the best and gain widespread adaption in the marketplace. Infrastructure projects also tend to give the best returns. If dApps built on a platform succeed in what they promise and gain real use, the fundamental value of the platform the dApp is built on itself will increase. For example, Microsoft Windows derives its value from the applications that have been developed on it. With cryptocurrency, you can invest in the actual underlying platform and profit as that platform succeed.\nImagine investing in the railroad infrastructure during the 19th century and getting paid rent as those rails were used by the trains. Would you want a piece of that? What about if you were paid when people used the ‘HTTP’ protocol. You would be gaining dividends in the web protocol itself, earning more and more as the protocol gains use. You would essentially be owning a piece of the web infrastructure. What would that be worth now? Billions. Trillions? Cryptocurrency platforms & protocols projects give you that option. Many are calling Blockchain the Web 3.0. A safer, more secure layer on which the new internet can be built upon, one centred around the idea of decentralization. That’s the longterm view anyways. But we still have ways to go — years likely — before this vision becomes a reality. At present, this web 3.0 is still in alpha and the best example of it is brought to its knees by a few thousand gamblers addicted to buying and selling digital cats. But if you hold to the long-term vision that the blockchain will be the seed of a new web 3.0, then investing in its infrastructure is a good play. dApps, beyond the speculative value they give now, will ultimately be tied (when the speculative frenzy has died down in the future) to the value of the company behind the application. Most dApps offer utility tokens which are, frankly, not at all needed as part of the core functionality. What am I saying here? Platforms and Protocols have delivered some of the biggest ROI.\nAnd if the market turns bear, these are the projects that will likely retain real value in the future — not the dApps built on them. So when evaluating potential ICO’s, give big preferential treatment to infrastructure projects over dAPPS. You’ll likely earn more over the long run. And they are safer bets over dapps. Look at some of the top cryptocurrency by market cap: EOS. ADA. IOTA. NEO. ICX. LISK. Notice a trend? A significant portion of the top 20 list is filled with infrastructure cryptocurrencies, not dApps. I don’t expect this to change until dApps actually start getting real-world use in the marketplace and disrupting industries. I figure we have anywhere from 2 to 5 years before this occurs. 2. ANTICIPATE THE MARKET TRENDS. Want to make millions. Here’s how. Anticipate the direction the market will go. Then invest in cryptocurrencies that promise those solutions. Now, this does sound easy but does involve knowing quite a bit about market trends and the general state of blockchain tech. You only get this by following crypto news and looking at what cryptocurrencies are currently rising. For example, I’m personally interested in cryptocurrency platforms & protocols that aim to solve the fundamental problems with current blockchain technology, the problems that must be overcome if blockchain is to be used to solve real problems and not just a speculative investment.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Oh Boy, the Bears are Back in Town! bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nGuess who just got back today? That wild eyed bull that had been away, has reappeared as Bitcoin price just broke $7,700! Question is, will the bears go quietly or will BTC continue trading sideways as the bears maul it into submission? Market Overview\nIt’s in tumultuous times such as these that investors should just kick back and relax. Take a deep breath, read a book, binge watch Netflix or just listen to Thin Lizzy as we at Bitcoinist love to do…hence the not so subtle mash up of the Thin Lizzy’s chorus in the title.\nBitcoin had been doing so well, climbing past $7,500 USD late last week and the move toward $7,700 was especially pleasant. For a moment, it almost appeared that McAfee’s prediction was coming true before our eyes, then with one fell swoop bitcoin price collapsed and it looks like we’re going back under $7,500 again.\nAnyhow, let’s get to it and see what’s happening with bitcoin. Daily Chart\nOn June 4th, BTC dropped from the ascending wedge, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change as the cryptocurrency failed to find footing above $7,500 and $7,650.\nFollowing the rising wedge breakdown, BTC nearly closed below $7,500 and the downtrend that started on May 5th continues as bears have mauled BTC back into the descending channel.\nAt the time of writing, BTC trades below the ascending wedge trendline, inside of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA well below the 50 and 100-day MA. The 100-day MA slopes downward, touching the 50-day MA at $8,482, which is a sign of bearish pressure.\nA glance at the the 1 hour chart (not pictured here) shows the 5 and 10-day MA crossed in steep descent and the RSI has fallen from 58 to 44 without any signs of a turn around. The Stoch also resides in overbought territory and appears to be reversing direction as the signal lines have crossed and begun to descend.\nThe general outlook portrays bears as having the advantage and a BTC close below $7,500 is likely to bring on further decline in BTC price. 4HR Chart\nGenerally, the 4 hour chart is quite similar to the daily chart, except for the 5-day MA ever so slightly above the 10 and 50-Day MA, though at the time of writing the 5-day MA has also rounded down and is hiding behind that big red candle.\nThe 10-day MA is beginning to put some distance between itself and the 50-day MA by inching its way up toward the 5-day MA; and while this does not appear to be a period of consolidation, the slope upwards in combination with a series of doji candlesticks at least shows the presence of some bullish pressure as BTC struggles to overtake $7,600. Bitcoin Price: Looking Ahead\nBTC will need to reach $7,850 in order for bulls to regain control.\nA close below the 50-day MA ($7,530) could see BTC drop to the nearest support at $7,365 and the absence of buyers could see the price drop as low as $7,200 – $7,000 again.\nAs suggested last week , if bears manage to retake control, BTC could re-enter the ascending wedge at $7,800 and in the event of high volume buying BTC could rise as high as the 50-day MA at $8,450 (daily chart). Traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of any upward movement.\nIn the meantime, it’s safe to assume that the majority of buyers are waiting patiently on the sidelines and since it’s good to always try and end things on a high note, we’ll leave you with this…\nThe 12th of June is a mere 5 days away and in the event of a miscast prediction , the cryptocurrency community can at least look forward to McAfee’s 2020 run for POTUS .\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

The two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin.\nI believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\nWe believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.\nIt is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” added van Eck.\nVanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a series of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF.\nSolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\nIn determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” commented Daniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.\nThe ETF is expected to list on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vaneck", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "valentina kirilova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan van eck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "etf home financial services", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T12:36:52.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dbffb208050c596a65ae1e6f000f3f79f225c07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0QwTAOflsNEz0dyaOy64_BWiFFhQEEOv5tOnmhMAk3wS_SNhKHSCsV2zSOSepCz_.r8mTDiXCV63g--", "site_full": "wahabali786.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://wahabali786.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tips and Tricks About Computer And More", "title": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн", "title_full": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн", "published": "2018-06-07T12:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dbffb208050c596a65ae1e6f000f3f79f225c07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0QwTAOflsNEz0dyaOy64_BWiFFhQEEOv5tOnmhMAk3wS_SNhKHSCsV2zSOSepCz_.r8mTDiXCV63g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OS Tech Tips (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T12:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн", "text": "The addition of “биткоин” (bitcoin) to the Russian spelling dictionary is “well grounded,” according to an important official from the Institute of Russian Language – another recognition of the cryptocurrency. Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo\nБиткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin Transliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it…\nBitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary Russia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн– Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language –“биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin –“бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters. Advertisements\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians, who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians, who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia, by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Well ‘BITCON: The Crypto Card Game’ may be right up your alley.\nThe BITCON card game aims to mimic the often turbulent Bitcoin market, with players strategically playing cards to either boost the value of Bitcoin or sink it.\nAccording to the product’s Kickstarter campaign , the creators were inspired by the Bitcoin craze and “decided to satire all the stupid bitcoin scams, cons, and investing stories we heard and create this crazy game.”\nThe gameplay is akin to Uno. A central card is drawn and the first player places a card that is either higher or lower than its value. If it’s higher, the market is surging and play continues clockwise with each player placing a card of higher value. If the card is lower, then the market is crashing and players rush to get rid of their low-value cards.\nThe game can end, unexpectedly, with a market collapse – not unlike real life. Players tally their cards and the person with the least amount of Bitcoin wins.\nThe ups and downs of Bitcoin have dominated the press in recent times due to its high volatility, with stories of overnight billionaires and busts alike .\nBitcoin has even become a popular pop culture staple, complete with its own slang (#hodlgang – and no, that’s not a typo) and rap videos .

Happy with your 4% to 8% gains from the stock market? Satisfied with that safe 2% you garner from a high-interest savings account? Disagree with that. What about seeing 3000%, 5000% or even 10000% returns in only a few months? Welcome to the wonderful, beautiful, terrifying, intoxicating world of ICO’s, the very frontier lands of the wild west that is the crypto landscape. ICOs are hugely risky but can be hugely rewarding. Do understand that the market conditions change regularly and what coin may be a hot pick today or this week, may not be the case later. The current market clearly has thrown the idea of coin fundamentals out of the window. People are dumping money into coins based solely on hype without understanding the basics of market cap, coin supply, and coin fundamentals. It’s even worse with ICO’s where people will hand over their life savings to a dodgy, possibly anonymous team promising to deliver vast wealth with only a simple whitepaper and nothing else. Because there are virtually no regulations for ICO’s right now, there’s a lot of scams and dodgy money grab ICO’s that can lose you all your investment. So it’s very important you do the research to limit the potential risk. I want to make it clear. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Do don’t go all into ICO’s lose all your money, then come back and blame me for your loses!\nICOs are risky and there is no avoiding that. But I’ve done very well on ICO’s and many many others have become multi mega millionaires by investing in ICOs. Crypto is becoming the greatest wealth redistribution on the planet, maybe of all time. And unlike previous examples, it’s the common man who’s getting in first, not the institutions. This is, in opinion, a once in a lifetime opportunity. A digital gold rush. The dotcom rush (i.e. the blockcoms) of our generation. Get in and make your money. Or watch from the sidelines while the few early birds with an appetite for risk make it rich. HOW MUCH CAN YOU MAKE FROM AN ICO? You can make ridiculous ROI’s if you choose an ICO that goes parabolic. A recent example for me (and some friends) was the ICON (ICX) ICO. The ICO price was around .10c per coin. As of the time of writing (3 weeks after ICO), ICX is worth about $11 dollars. I expect by the launch of the mainet Jan 24th, the coin will be worth $20 and after the end of January 2018, ICX may shoot up to $30 to $50. Certainly, ICON will be $100 or more by end of 2018. Right now at $11, ICON has given a return in fiat of more than 100x. That means if you put in $10,000 dollars into the ICO, you will now have about 1 million dollars. This is not some sort of lotto ticket that you hear about but never witness yourself. I have many friends who invested around $10,000 and are now closing on over a million USD. I myself made millions from ICX. And this is only one of half a dozen big ICO’s I’ve invested in over the past 7 months.\nSo ICO’s can and do make people rich. One ICO that goes parabolic is all you need to retire. ICO’s that go parabolic (i.e. explode in value many many times over) are not as rare as you think. I’ve had previous ICO’s I’ve done that have gone parabolic such as BQX (ETHOS) which went about 30x about a month out of ICO and six months later are valued at over 200x in value. There are some upcoming ICO’s I’ve done such as Wanchain, POA, Zilliqa that are due to hit the market in January that I’m expecting to go parabolic, going up 30x+ (and maybe 100-200x at least post-ICO over 2018). HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ICO. Now with practically a few ICO’s being launched every single day and hundreds per month, how do you sift through the shit to find the gems? There are many factors and variables to consider. But I’ll give you some basic guidelines that will help you choose the right ICO’s, or at least, help you avoid bad ones. I want to state that I firmly believe in trying to invest for the long term (as much as this is possible with blockchain) and to choose projects that look like they have lasting value, not short-term pump and dump coins of which 95% of the crypto market is formed. That means that I want to put money into a coin that I feel can actually deliver on their promise and bring something to market. I want to invest in projects that I feel will survive a market crash. With that said, let’s go over how to choose the best ICO’s.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/making-money-from-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-part-1/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben krypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "home / banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T08:17:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7e13dfcc10ae03e80577b02a67cb0477a669de8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIE18ghyGBvvM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

Bitcoin price led a brief bullish spike during the session on Wednesday, but the 61.8% Fib retracement level prevented gains towards $7,000.\nThe department of cybercrime investigation unit of South Korea’s provincial police department has reported that it will be charging Coinone exchange due the margin trading it offers its clients. The department says, in retrospect, Coinone is offering illegal gambling and that it could be aiding criminal laundering activities.\nThe unit has been conducting an investigation for about 10 months and the report shows that approximately 19,000 people took part in the margin trading. Moreover, 20 of them became conspicuous due to the high volumes of transactions they recorded. Combined they all transacted a total of $2.8 million in about 3,000 to 13,000 margin trading orders on Coinone exchange. The CEO, Myunghun Cha will also be charged along two other executives and the 20 traders who had the highest volumes. Coinone, in response to CoinDesk’s inquiries, said:\n“At this time we are focused on cooperating with the ongoing investigation, and will continue to do so as the case is in the process of moving over to the Prosecution Service from the Police Agency.”\nBitcoin price analysis\nBitcoin price led a brief bullish spike during the session on Wednesday, the 61.8% Fib retracement level with the last high leg of $8,559 and a low of $7,090 prevented further gains towards $7,000. However, BTC/USD spiked again on Thursday Asian trading hours, while using $7,500 as a support. It attacked the retracement level above, this time breaking the key resistance at $7,000 and is now trading marginally above $7,700. The contracting triangle will offer resistance towards $7,800, but the psychological $8,000 is still out of reach for now.

Some took this as a prime opportunity to slam the company.\nOn Friday a large number of consumers in Europe experienced a Visa outage that left them unable to make purchases.\nI was in the pub when I discovered this and the thought of having to leave and take out cash to pay for my Friday vino was highly distressing to say the least.\nOf course, I’m sure there were some people who had a worse time than I did, perhaps while in the middle of paying for other necessities like food and tickets to Deadpool 2.\nThe Brandwatch React team wondered what a Europe-wide Visa outage might look like on social – especially when people didn’t necessarily know that their card being declined was part of a large outage as opposed to their accounts being drained. Tracking the confusion\nTo start with, we looked at @mentions of Visa alongside mentions of “card not working” (and variations). Both saw a sizeable spike on Friday.\nWe also noticed that mentions of banks were affected, with spikes in mentions on the day of the outage.\nConfused customers were directing questions about their cards being declined to their own bank despite the problem being with Visa. just been declined in Sainburys sad face — James Meeks (@themeekstar) June 1, 2018\nConsidering the confusion, it’s good for banks to get on top of any industry wide errors quickly and communicate what’s happening to customers. One way to be alerted early to these problems would be to set up alerts for increases in social mentions of cards being declined or other potential problems consumers might encounter where the cause is not clear.\nIn this case, it wasn’t just consumers who were frustrated by the slow down. People working at in-person points of sale were not happy at all about the outage. fuckin cards not working made my shift HELLISH — felicity (@xntisxcial) June 1, 2018\nIn the pub where I was scrabbling for cash to pay for my rosé, the first the bar tenders had heard of the Visa outage – despite having multiple cards declined – was when I presented them with a BBC News article about what was going on. Perhaps a more robust communications system to notify those working on the front line of sales could work well to ensure both merchants and customers know what’s happening when things go wrong with their transactions to ensure there isn’t a mass panic.\nWhen I first saw the news I took out £50 in cash out and told all my friends we were on the brink of financial collapse. I may have overreacted. Bitcoin lovers had their moment\nSocial negativity directed at Visa for the temporary outage wasn’t just coming from card holders.\nBitcoin proponents were keen to make their voices heard, and this tweet did particularly well. What’s up @Visa need help? pic.twitter.com/Fi7vLOzf1f\nI have no stats on what percentage of time Visa’s payment system has been functional for to counter this with, but the pro-bitcoin sass was obviously appreciated on social.

Read the article\nMeanwhile, while “@Noohoo”‘s point wasn’t necessarily bitcoin related, he did make an interesting comment on the issue.\nThe dominance of Visa was made even more obvious by the uproar that occurred when there was an outage. The @visa and @mastercard issue begs the question..Why are there such few payment systems in a world of 7 Billion people! — Mr Romney (@noowhoo) June 1, 2018 What can be learned from Twitter conversations around the Visa outage?\nHere are three things we learned from our speedy research into the issue: People are not afraid to post about issues they’re having with banking on Twitter, whether it’s complaining about their card getting declined or pointedly asking for action from organizations. This ties in with research we’ve done before around the financial services sector which is one of the most negatively discussed industries online. When things go wrong people will go to their bank for help, even if the problem isn’t their fault. Banks can catch problems and set up appropriate communications early by being alerted to issues being reported on social. Bitcoin lovers are successfully taking up opportunities to make digs at traditional financial systems. Organizations within those systems should be prepared to deal with these attacks, whether it be honing counter arguments to supply to journalists inquiring about the crypto currency or proactively setting up campaigns that address them.\nAre you a journalist looking to cover our data?

The transaction rate is so slow that it constantly grinds to a halt with high demand. As far as I know, this problem cannot be solved without increasing the intensity of the second problem.\n2) It has extraordinary energy consumption. I quote from an article appended below: “A fluctuating bitcoin price, along with increases in computer efficiency, has slowed the cryptocurrency’s energy footprint growth rate to ‘just’ 20 percent per month so far in this year. If that keeps up, bitcoin would consume all the world’s electricity by January 2021.”\nBitcoin is clearly destructive….\nThe energy usage is a cost of bit coin transactions which has to be paid for so it means that bitcoins should have a constant drain in value. This cost works like the signorage on medieval coins (the charge for turning gold or silver into coins), because bitcoin exchange is the only ‘value’ being produced. This drain on value is probably not a good deal, and probably can only be funded in an apparently non detrimental way as long as new bitcoin users appear, and bid for coins. This makes bitcoin a Ponzi scheme which will eventually collapse, given the limits on transactions, and the eventual limit on new participants compared to old participants.\nThe problem for non-users is the pollution from energy consumption, which is (if the article is correct) apparently huge. That pollution is a cost that appears to be being socialised or shuffled onto everyone, even if those being enriched hope that they can get rich enough to avoid the problems it generates. It is also possible that taxpayers will end up funding the energy costs, which is also probably not a good idea.\nIn the long term unless the energy consumption can be reduced (and the slow speed increased) bitcoin does cost too much to maintain.\nhttps://grist.org/article/bitcoins-energy-use-got-studied-and-you-libertarian-nerds-look-even-worse-than-usual/amp/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T11:50:04.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf38fe98886b74eb55d2671728a4ac5a7c269561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3VyHkidFc7OZr1PW9H3gua7AT99zOfJ5MR1N77sTg_FrEOEIFZLPBVkce5FZOnEWYRtdiqCRuzD_Bw--", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "Bitcoin Planet Reaches 1-Day Trading Volume of $218.00 (CRYPTO:BTPL)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Planet Reaches 1-Day Trading Volume of $218.00 (CRYPTO:BTPL)", "published": "2018-06-07T11:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1748.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf38fe98886b74eb55d2671728a4ac5a7c269561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3VyHkidFc7OZr1PW9H3gua7AT99zOfJ5MR1N77sTg_FrEOEIFZLPBVkce5FZOnEWYRtdiqCRuzD_Bw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rob Logan", "published": "2018-06-07T11:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Planet Reaches 1-Day Trading Volume of $218.00 (CRYPTO:BTPL)", "text": "Posted by Rob Logan on Jun 7th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Planet (CURRENCY:BTPL) traded up 10.9% against the US dollar during the 24-hour period ending at 22:00 PM Eastern on May 30th.

There's an Amit Bhardwaj, who's involved in some scam. He had purchased poker team from our poker league but didn't make payment so we expelled his team. I've given my statement,\" Raj Kundra told ANI.\nClearing the air on the issue, Kundra said in a statement, \"I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency.\"\nAccording to a report in Zee News, during the interrogation, several names of high-profile Bollywood celebrities have also cropped up which includes Sunny Leone, Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi and Nargis Fakhri . The ED is likely to question Shilpa Shetty as well on the matter.\nHowever, this is not the first time Kundra had a brush with law. In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team. Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nIn his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: \"I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.\"\n\"The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,\" said Kundra.\nHe added that Bhardwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n\"However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,\" he said.\n\"Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company's future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,\" he said.\nIt may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nThe ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe Pune police had later arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek in the case.\nIn May, the Gujarat branch of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Kirit Paladiya for stealing bitcoins from his partner. According to the police authorities, Paladiya stole 176 bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore from his partner, Shailesh Bhatt.\nFurthermore, Amreli's Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel, Amreli local Crime Branch inspector Anant Patel and two other constables were arrested for alleged involvement in the case.
