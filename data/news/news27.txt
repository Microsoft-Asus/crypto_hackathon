Also, it has been reported that American universities have started investing in crypto hedge funds. The investments are on a limited scale but nevertheless indicate a growing interest from academic institutions. And, authorities in Belgium warn the public about crypto scams with a “Too good to be true” website.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Exchange ETF Action and Wozniak Wants Bitcoin to Rule World Financial Authorities in Germany Find Six Institutions Trading Cryptos\nAt least six financial institutions in Germany trade cryptocurrencies, the country’s Federal Ministry of Finance revealed. The information emerged from an answer to a question filed by Bundestag member Thomas Lutze. The figure is based on findings of the German financial regulator Bafin, which supervises the financial sector and is also expected to monitor crypto trading activities. The banks involved were not named.\nThere is no case registered with Bafin against financial institutions suspected of any breach of money laundering regulations, due diligence requirements, nor reporting obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, the Bundesfinanzministerium said, quoted by Reuters . Each such institution, which has permission to trade properties, also has the right to set up mechanisms allowing the exchange of bitcoin to euros and vice versa, the ministry noted.\nThe Finance ministry also said that the issuance of a digital central bank money is currently not an option in the Eurozone, “given the wide range of unresolved issues and significant risks associated with unclear benefits.” According to the report, the Federal government in Berlin does not see crypto-related risks to the stability of the financial markets due to the low market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and the limited interdependence with the financial sector. East Coast Universities Invest in Crypto Hedge Funds\nAcademic institutions in the US have started making small investments into cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to a lawyer working in the industry. These universities are getting involved on a limited basis for strategic reasons, the founder of Capital Fund Law Group, John Lore, told Business Insider . “I can’t say the names because that’s attorney-client but we have people mostly on the East Coast that have begun doing investments in this space on a fairly modest basis,” he added.\nThe New York-based law group specializes in providing legal services to the hedge fund industry. According to Lore, at this point investors are putting in very small percentages of their net worth into these new funds. He doesn’t expect institutional investors, such as pension funds, to invest in crypto soon, with one notable exception – university endowment funds, some of which have already begun to invest on a limited scale. “We see academia as a tie between these somewhat young and enthusiastic fund managers and capital raising,” the lawyer said.\nCryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technologies have seen a growing interest from universities. Leading academic institutions, such as Cambridge and Oxford, have introduced crypto and blockchain related courses. In December, the Belarusian National Technical University announced a diploma course covering cryptocurrencies, derivatives, and ICOs, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. In April, the Fundacao Getulio Vargas University in Sao Paulo launched “Brazil’s first Master’s degree in cryptofinance.” It has been reported that North Korea’s Pyongyang University is also offering educational courses on cryptocurrencies. Belgian Regulators Warn About Crypto Scams with New Website\nFinancial authorities and regulators in Belgium have launched a website dedicated to warning the public about crypto scams and raising awareness about the associated risks. The move comes in response to substantial increase in interest towards investing in cryptocurrencies and related products. The site, temooiomwaartezijn.be (“Too good to be true”), can also be used to report suspicious offers and projects in the crypto space.\nBelgians can find there useful tips on how to avoid fraudulent schemes. The site advises investors to make sure they know who they are dealing with, check if a project is registered as a scam and never share sensitive personal data. Regulators say people should always request clear and understandable information, take their time to critically evaluate an offer before accepting it and be wary of promises of excessive profits. “If the return seems too good to be true, it usually is. Profit is never guaranteed,” they warn.\nScam-related losses of almost €2.2 million have been reported to financial authorities in the country, with at least 118 victims having contacted Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). Belgian regulators claim only 4% of the cases are reported. According to their estimates, the total financial loss from fraud related to cryptocurrencies amounts to around 130 million euros annually. In March, the financial watchdog published a list of 19 cryptocurrency trading platforms showing signs of fraud. Last month, the FSMA expanded its blacklist including more businesses reported by customers.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Well, you reap what you sow.\nI will concede that trading $250 increments in the $6k to $10k price arena makes more sense than it would in the $14k to $17k price range, so even I brought down my trading increments based upon where the price is currently... Adaptation to new conditions, right? Neither of us is stagnant, or at least I hope not. We have to adjust with the changing conditions of the market, even though we might be tweaking here and there rather than making large changes... We are on a similar page in regards to ongoing tweaking strategies and attempting to learn from mistakes, no?\nAdjusting to the reality on the ground can make sense.\nNote that 'castigated' seems an accurate depiction of your past pronouncements on my strategy. (this viewed in ponderation of other peoples' presently pointing out your posting proclivities may provide probability to give your person pause)\nWe're currently in a $125 range for me. After we go up for a fair bit, we'll be in what is currently my $250 interval range. Which presently continues well past previous ATH. I consider any above previous ATH to be subject to interval change. These standing sell orders above previous ATH are all built from coin-side profits built on earlier transactions. When a trade unit sized profit is made, it gets entered as a sell on the top of the ladder.\nIf I were a more diligent sort, I'd build my interval upon a sliding percentage scale.

More recently the Managing Director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde , has had a lot of positive words to say about digital currencies. Moreover, the IMF also showcased a picture of money evolving featuring a picture of a bitcoin which was displayed on the front page of the IMF we b site . Now the IMF has released a report written by a variety of IMF researchers who state:\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that some crypto assets will eventually be more widely adopted and fulfill more of the functions of money in some regions or private e-commerce networks. This picture is displayed on one of the articles featured on the IMF website’s front page. A Payment Shift\nThe study notes that the global financial crisis and bank bailouts have “renewed skepticism in some quarters” of the world and there’s a possibility that digital assets can affect the traditional global monetary policies. There’s also talk of a “payment shift” within the study where cryptocurrencies could replace fiat in some regions.\n“Such a shift could also portend a change in the way money is created in the digital age: from credit money to commodity money, we may move full circle back to where we were in the Renaissance,” explains the IMF report.\nEconomists continue to debate the origins of money, and why monetary systems seem to have alternated between commodity and credit money throughout history. If crypto assets indeed lead to a more prominent role for commodity money in the digital age, the demand for central bank money is likely to decline. “Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays, so I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies,” said the Managing Director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde in September of 2017. Competitive Pressure and the Allure of the Central Bank Coin\nThe IMF paper also details how banks should respond with competitive pressure and they should continue to solidify fiat currencies as a “unit of account.” Cryptocurrencies, however, have a hard time becoming a standard unit of account the IMF notes and this is because “valuation is largely based on beliefs that are not well anchored” which has made the majority of digital currencies quite volatile.\nThe researcher’s paper mentions that central banks could counteract with their own digital currencies. It goes on to say that the banks have many challenges and opportunities in this digital age but they must regain the public’s trust to remain relevant. “They can remain relevant by providing more stable units of account than crypto assets and by making central bank money attractive as a medium of exchange in the digital economy,” the IMF paper concludes.\nWhat do you think about the IMF’s report and how positive this organization is towards cryptocurrencies?

He said a segment about buying Ripple’s XRP epitomized the “peak nonsense” of the bitcoin mania that swept financial media and markets.\nMike Novogratz, the famed hedge funder turned crypto-enthusiast, poked a little fun at a segment on financial news network CNBC when describing to rival Bloomberg News the crypto hype that marked the very start of 2018.\n“CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here, they literally had a show where they were one by one walking people through how to buy the Ripple, the XRP coin, literally when it was trading at $US3.20 having moved from $US0.20 8 weeks earlier,” Novogratz said speaking to Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker .\nNovogratz said that was “peak nonsense.”\nRipple’s XRP, a bitcoin rival, was technically trading above $US2.57 when CNBC broke down how to buy it on exchange operator Poloniex on January 5 . Still, the crypto market was red-hot then, with the entire market racing towards an all-time high market capitalisation above $US830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP ultimately fell to $US0.49 on April 5.\nTo be sure, many publications created walk-throughs for readers and viewers on how to purchase crypto-assets during the run-up. Business Insider published “Ripple’s XRP is the hot new cryptocurrency – here’s how you buy it” in January when Ripple was trading at approximately $US2 a token.\nThe second-half of 2017 also saw the rise of initial coin offerings, a quick way to raise funds using cryptocurrency. Many of these fundraisers were promoted by celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather.\nNovogratz said this phenomenon might be the reason regulators started to clamp down in 2018. But it is something Novogratz, who is building out a crypto merchant bank, thinks is a positive sign for the market.\n“So we are going to knock out some of the crap from the system,” he said. “It is healthy.”\nNotably, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit a number of cryptocurrency company with subpoenas . It also recently promoted Valerie Szczepanik to lead its new cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The New York Attorney General’s office earlier this year launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe question now hanging over the space is whether regulators will deem crypto assets as securities, which would require entities that facilitate crypto trading to subscribe to a whole range of regulations.\n“I bet dimes to doughnuts [regulators] will say ‘ethereum probably was a security but it is not anymore,'” Novogratz said.\nNovogratz said there are about 200 tokens in regulatory “no-man’s land.”\nJay Clayton, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, didn’t provide additional clarity during an interview Wednesday with CNBC.\n“I’m not going to comment on specific crypto assets and whether they are a security or are not a security,” Clayton told CNBC’s Bob Pisani.\nCNBC declined to comment.

cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nSouth Africa’s central bank has revealed remarkable results of Project Khokha, its proof-of-concept trial to replicate interbank payments and settlements on an ethereum-based enterprise blockchain.\nThe South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has published its report [PDF] on a “real-world’ trial of a blockchain-based wholesale payment system lasting nearly three months since the mid-February.\nThe central bank revealed the practical platform was deployed in a “realistic test environment” wherein the blockchain was able to handle the entire typical daily volume of South Africa’s Real Time Gross Settlement System (SAMOS), about 70,000 transactions, in about 75 minutes. On average, transactions were processed within 2 seconds with full confidentiality and a 100% settlement rate. Image: SARB\nA separate test iteration simulating a failed SARB node wherein banks would still be able to transact with each other without the central bank’s oversight achieved similar astonishing results with 70,000 transactions settled in less than 2 hours.\nThe pilot also involved numerous domestic banks including Absa, Capitec, Discovery Bank, FirstRand, Investec, Nedbank and Standard Bank. Image: SARB\nDespite the sweeping success of the PoC trial, the central bank insists that there are still “many issues” to tackle before bringing the blockchain platform into production.\nIn a statement [PDF], the authority said:\nSome of these issues relate to the practicalities of implementation, but also to legal and regulatory factors and to the broader economic impact.\nFurther, the central bank insisted that the objective of the blockchain settlement system wasn’t intended to replace SAMOS at this point, but to provide a better understanding of how the interbank settlement system would integrate with the Quorom blockchain platform.\nAs reported previously, Project Khokha was announced in February by the central bank in partnership with Ethereum coder collective ConsenSys deploying the use of Quorum, an enterprise blockchain developed by JPMorgan and EthLab, an Ethereum startup.\nConsensys has also worked with Singapore’s central bank in the latter’s own ‘Project Ubin‘, a notable effort by the authority to issue a digitized token of the Singaporean dollar on a blockchain.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "central bank bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:25:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c66d9cadddeed63b178bb0ea6bb02e440022e7f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocaMeMEaOFYa0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-06T11:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c66d9cadddeed63b178bb0ea6bb02e440022e7f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocaMeMEaOFYa0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LigwagGanern", "published": "2018-06-06T11:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: Pe4kin on December 15, 2017, 09:13:26 AM How many idiots who decided to invest in bitcoin\nIt is necessary not to watch as he grows from 15000 to 17000.

In order for the system to reach these levels of growth and its benefits to be realised, it’s essential for businesses to understand the capabilities of blockchain and other distributed ledger technology (DLT) beyond Bitcoin.\nDean Elwood, CEO of blockchain company Umony and contributor to the report, said: “Bitcoin is creating so much noise, much of it negative, that the genuinely useful and practical side of blockchain is getting buried. I think there is a real pressure on the industry and people like me, to make sure that everyone really understands the difference between blockchain and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.”\nThe report features insight from specialists including NEX Exchange, Blockchain Hub, BTL Group and AgriLedger.\nMany of the contributors believe that the development of blockchain technology will happen much faster if the industry collaborates and regulators are involved in the development process. This is because the very nature of DLT revolves around sharing information, not only internally, but also with customers and, in many cases, with competitors.\nDavid Brennan, partner and co-chair of Gowling WLG’s global tech team, said: “The business community has been quick to grasp the numerous opportunities blockchain solutions afford, but the key challenge will be communicating its significance to both the public and policymakers. Collaboration between governments and the private sector is key in order to facilitate widespread acceptance and adoption of the technology.”\nThe firm’s research also suggests that the appropriate industry regulators need to catch-up with the technological developments within blockchain and DLT, yet the majority of those interviewed do not believe that the technology itself requires regulation.\nAndrew Gardiner, founder and CEO of Property Moose, said: “Cryptocurrencies need regulating, absolutely, 100%. But you can’t regulate blockchain itself. It’s just a piece of tech. For example, do you regulate Microsoft Word or Google for emails? They all have to be ISO compliant, so you’ll have industry standards, but these are not regulation.”\nFor a full overview of the research conducted with financial services experts, including insight on who will be affected by blockchain, the opportunities and threats facing the technology and the level of investment now going into blockchain development, see Gowling WLG’s white paper ‘The ultimate disruptor – how blockchain is transforming financial services’.\n(Source: Gowling WLG)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dean elwood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "umony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gowling wlg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:51:01.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23142ba5b9c68a92319b86f6885803f7a1d66295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTeocrtF0XhDgJygmgnqodlQEznD9BRF3jDq8IM.3NI4BEsWUY_tYq1yjK.qlqM3BvteV2ujiCekk_iaYJ.Iu8CI-", "site_full": "www.exchangerates.org.uk", "site": "exchangerates.org.uk", "site_section": "http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Exchange Rates UK - Currency News", "title": "Bitcoin breakout fails as price heads back towards $7k", "title_full": "Bitcoin breakout fails as price heads back towards $7k", "published": "2018-06-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39881, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23142ba5b9c68a92319b86f6885803f7a1d66295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTeocrtF0XhDgJygmgnqodlQEznD9BRF3jDq8IM.3NI4BEsWUY_tYq1yjK.qlqM3BvteV2ujiCekk_iaYJ.Iu8CI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "François Auré", "published": "2018-06-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin breakout fails as price heads back towards $7k", "text": "Bitcoin Breakout Fails As Price Heads Back Towards $7k Bitcoin Breakout Fails As Price Heads Back Towards $7k Facebook BTC/USD drags crypto exchange rate markets lower\nThe price of Bitcoin was a disappointment to bulls on Tuesday who once again had to endure the fact that another breakout to the upside has failed. Although the volumes remain low and the price action lacks clear direction, the bear trend appears to be still in force as short-sellers and profit takers continue to view bounces as clear selling opportunities. Dip buying has always been a popular tactic in cryptocurrency markets with crypto-twitter often using the term “accumulation” as a popular term. The problem for these investors recently is that while there have been bounces off dips, ultimately the trajectory has been lower for most of this year. On the positive side of things, $7k has been holding, and the price action has been moving more sideways than down. Technical analysis more neutral than bearish\nAlthough things are looking worse for Cryptocurrency markets again, it is perhaps too early to give up all hope of a rally. If anything the market’s disappointment is the most bearish fundamental on Tuesday after the failure in the upper $7000s. Omkar Godbole, an analyst at Coindesk released his viewpoint on Bitcoin, noticing how everything had looked so rosy over the weekend,\n“Bitcoin's retreat from Sunday's high of $7,779 has poured cold water over the bull mood generated by the weekend's positive price action and neutralized the immediate outlook. BTC closed on Sunday (as per UTC) above a key falling trendline resistance level, signaling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.”\nUnfortunately for BTC bulls the ominous “bull trap” forecast a few days earlier by Mr. Godbole came to fruition as he describes how the charts were quick to call time on the rally and low volumes once more came back to haunt investors,\n“Bitcoin suffered a rising wedge breakdown (bearish pattern) in the U.S. hours on Monday, signaling that the corrective rally from the recent low of $7,040 had ended. In the end, the failed breakout was no surprise, as low trading volumes had warned of a bull trap.”\nA lack of speculation is likely to haunt Bitcoin markets for some time, with moves in either direction, but particularly higher, lacking conviction without the necessary volumes to back them up. Who knows when speculation will increase, but so far it is all quiet on the Western front.

PermaBull Tom Lee Appears on CNBC Fast Money\nOn Monday, Tom Lee, long known as a cryptocurrency bull in the space, went on CNBC to dispel bearish sentiment against Bitcoin’s viability and more importantly, its price.\\u00a0\\u00a0 ‘Fast Money’ host, Melissa Lee, pointed out that bears held three things against Bitcoin.\nFirstly, that the Google search trends for Bitcoin are down, dropping to almost 25% of the levels seen at the start of the year. Many Bitcoin bears believe that this indicator shows that direct investment interest in this cryptocurrency. Although this may be somewhat true, this indicator tells far from the whole story. As well, Tom was quick to point out that the Google Trends indicator was not fully indicative of the price and popularity of Bitcoin :\n“Google searches aren\\u2019t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a \\u2018coincident indicator,\\u2019 and therefore shouldn\\u2019t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor .”\nIn this case, this “coincident indicator” means that it moves in correlation with Bitcoin’s price, instead of preemptively signaling the price movement of the popular cryptocurrency. Lee also assured viewers that he believes that traditional institutions are still interested in investing in the space, despite the short-term bear market which the cryptocurrency market has experienced.\\u00a0\nAnother point which Bitcoin bears made was that trading volumes have plummeted since last year’s bull run. According to CoinMarketCap , trading volume is down by over 75% since the late December highs seen in the industry.\nTo help combat this supposed bearish indicator, Lee called the run-up last year a “parabolic blow off.” This essentially means that he thought that the volume seen during late last year was an abnormal figure, and should not be as relevant now.\\u00a0 He also compared the daily figures to other volume figures from earlier in 2017;\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent .”\nThis fact affirming that he believes that the volume present in the cryptocurrency trading space is still “healthy.” Tom Lee Affirms That Bitcoin Will Move In An Upward Direction\nFinally, Lee addressed the bearish sentiment that Bitcoin has been struggling to break over the mental and technical barriers in the $10,000 range. To help assist his bullish views on the market, he utilized some research done by his market analysis firm, FundStrat. The Bitcoin bull said specifically:\n“Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nAccording to his prior appearances \\u00a0on CNBC segments, Bitcoin’s price movements can be mainly attributed to 10 days throughout a whole year. If you took out those 10 days in any year, Bitcoin would be down an average of 25% in that year.\\u00a0 With this data, he made it apparent that he believes that a Bitcoin price surge will occur within the time span of a few days.\\u00a0\nIf Bitcoin somehow manages to continue its downward trend, Tom Lee made it clear that he believes that Bitcoin will hold price levels at the cost of mining a single Bitcoin. According to research from his firm, the current cost of mining a Bitcoin sits at an average of $6,000 and if history is any indication, that means Bitcoin should hold at $6,000 if worst comes to worst.\n Image from Shutterstock\nThe post Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin bu tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "perma", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bull tom lee appears", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T23:20:02.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be0fd69765c6d47b4b6383b442e1020a9958ee1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaMmU4jV9Ell3tvYpEwBVwY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Shopping with bitcoin", "title_full": "Shopping with bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T10:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be0fd69765c6d47b4b6383b442e1020a9958ee1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaMmU4jV9Ell3tvYpEwBVwY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dalimex", "published": "2018-06-06T10:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Shopping with bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: Dergansion on May 31, 2018, 04:40:16 AM whether later bitcoin can be used for shopping in the real world and there its automatic coin cash box like real world original currency .. and can be recognized many worlds into legal currency especially bitcoin\nIt does not seem to be happening, because very high daily fluctuations will affect the decision to make a sale and purchase.\nBut if it can be minimized, of course there are other obstacles again, such as format confirmation and so forth.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:49:42.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cefa9be3e000e42dcafa5b5b07e9a57f9a9ff8f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZxHCjAc8EdOfXkDPYVV5taGW7yaYc9e9rn8f29RvwevMJTwM2mu8b_ibMtsLj3EzUkNIq1rpK0kFuT98ctH9.yEagYQwf4gKOKFwQIfyjEQ--", "site_full": "www.researchgate.net", "site": "researchgate.net", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Could someone explain me why bitcoin mining heat is not recycled for greener and cheaper mining as this technology exists ?", "title_full": "Could someone explain me why bitcoin mining heat is not recycled for greener and cheaper mining as this technology exists ?", "published": "2018-06-06T10:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.rgstatic.net/blog/files/2016/12/thermoelectric-power-banner-2-1-1400x403.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 644, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cefa9be3e000e42dcafa5b5b07e9a57f9a9ff8f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZxHCjAc8EdOfXkDPYVV5taGW7yaYc9e9rn8f29RvwevMJTwM2mu8b_ibMtsLj3EzUkNIq1rpK0kFuT98ctH9.yEagYQwf4gKOKFwQIfyjEQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T10:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Could someone explain me why bitcoin mining heat is not recycled for greener and cheaper mining as this technology exists ?", "text": "Read next: Read next This high-jumping robot could help... Share How we can turn wasted heat into electricity 16th December 2016 by Katherine Lindemann From watches that run on body heat to generators in factory smokestacks, thermoelectric materials have countless applications. Thermoelectric materials can convert heat to electricity, meaning they have incredible potential to turn the waste heat all around us into a green source of energy. Prof. Muhammet Toprak of KTH - Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden develops these materials, and we speak with him about what we can expect from them in the future. To learn more about his research, follow his project on ResearchGate. ResearchGate: What are thermoelectric materials? Muhammet Toprak: Thermoelectric materials are solid-state materials that are capable of converting heat to electricity and vice versa. In some cases, they’re used in cooling devices that rely on electrical currents to remove heat. In others, they do the opposite, converting temperature gradients, or differences, to an electrical voltage. Thermoelectric devices are particularly favorable because they are solid-state devices, eliminating the need for maintenance of moving parts or a fluid to transfer the heat. RG: How widespread is energy production from these materials? Toprak: Thermoelectric materials have not yet reached widespread use and are most commonly used in portable cooling devices for cars. However, there are also many attempts to use thermoelectric devices for harvesting waste heat. For example, there are wristwatches that run on thermoelectric power from body heat, and several plans for designing wearable thermoelectric energy harvesters. Of course, the human body produces relatively low-grade heat. High-grade heat offers other opportunities, and thermoelectric generators have been developed to harvest energy from wood stoves and the exhaust tubes of trucks and automobiles. RG: What are some other potential sources of waste heat? Toprak: Fossil fuel-based energy sources still make up more than 80 percent of the total energy supply and are inefficient, meaning they produce a lot of waste heat. In a coal-fired power plant, at least 56 percent of the energy is wasted. Until the renewable energy sector grows enough to handle all our energy needs, we need to develop the technologies to harvest this wasted heat. Thermoelectric materials provide an opportunity for this, as they’re well suited for use in power plants, refractories, metallurgy, and other processes resulting in waste heat. Thermoelectric generators are also coupled with solar collectors, where solar thermal energy is converted to electrical power. Heat from a car's brakes or exhaust can generate power to run its radio, air conditioning, and electric windows. Credit: Timothy Vogel About two thirds of the energy from gasoline used in cars and trucks is also wasted heat. One of the most important applications for thermoelectric generators is reducing the carbon footprint of transport by using the waste heat from the exhaust pipe to generate power. There are even attempts to use the heat from brakes for power generation. This power then can be used to charge the vehicle’s battery, or run electric windows, air conditioning, etc. to improve fuel economy. In one project, we are planning to integrate the thermoelectric generators into factory chimneys where very hot steam is released into the atmosphere. This will be an interesting large-scale project to demonstrate the impact that’s possible with this technology. RG: How do thermoelectric generators work? Toprak: Typically, there are n-type and p-type thermoelectric elements, which are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. Thus, when placed under a thermal gradient, the charge carriers will generate a net current, producing electrical voltage. The energy conversion is direct, which means that scalability of the devices with good performance is not a big concern. RG: What are the biggest challenges standing in the way of more widespread use of thermoelectric materials to produce energy? Toprak: Currently, some thermoelectric materials are well proven for generating power with low-grade heat. At higher temperatures, where the grade of the heat is increased, the energy that can be harvested also increases. However, materials intended for use with intermediate and high temperatures have stability issues. Furthermore, electrical contact materials react with other materials, which changes their composition and degrades the device’s performance. The crucial challenge is to make good electrical and thermal contacts. The large temperature gradient across the device puts mechanical stress on the contact points. Because of this, high-grade heat is usually cooled down before it can be harvested, meaning the highly energetic waste heat is still not used at its full potential. RG: Are there any drawbacks to using thermoelectric materials? Toprak: Some promising thermoelectric materials contain toxic or scarce elements, which prevent their production and use at a large scale. Alternative materials that are more abundant and benign are currently being developed to make this technology more appealing. RG: What do you foresee for the future of thermoelectric energy harvesting? Toprak: Although thermoelectric material development is on the right track, putting these materials into devices where the whole device is going to be cycled between very high temperatures and ambient temperature has not yet yielded long-lasting performance due to degradation. However, if we can solve the material related issues, I am confident that thermoelectric harvesting will be broadly used. In terms of fabrication and processing, we can’t limit ourselves to conventional approaches. The way the material is fabricated and processed has an immense effect on its final performance. This means that even slight chemical modifications of the materials require extensive testing to identify the best processing conditions. This is time-demanding research, and it would not be appropriate to expect miracles in a short time. But the future of the technology is promising.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katherine lindemann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammet toprak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kth - royal institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:25:06.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39f6f7212d840fc603735b0ec7e29cf363ff78df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hQ0jFPMhvIa4r4KiV3f1.GvPc61nTx8bpVKGhaZt3BegCN54HEh3fQmHojD7SWcGFgcwnTBSb1w--", "site_full": "www.homepokergames.com", "site": "homepokergames.com", "site_section": "http://www.homepokergames.com/vbforum/forumdisplay.php?f=207", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Poker Journals - HomePokerGames Poker Forum", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "title_full": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - HomePokerGames Poker Forum", "published": "2018-06-06T10:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39f6f7212d840fc603735b0ec7e29cf363ff78df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hQ0jFPMhvIa4r4KiV3f1.GvPc61nTx8bpVKGhaZt3BegCN54HEh3fQmHojD7SWcGFgcwnTBSb1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helenwog", "published": "2018-06-06T10:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "text": "XEvil 4.0 + RCModule : NEW best soft for breaking any Captcha 1.

There is a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move past the $7,650 and $7,680 resistance levels to gain traction.\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs above $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC\\/USD must clear the $7,650 barrier for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nYesterday, we saw a bearish wave below the $7,400 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair traded as low as $7,369 before buyers appeared. A base was formed near $7,350 before the price started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the $7,450 level along with the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low.\nThe price also succeeded in settling above the $7,500 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Later, there was a close above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low. However, the price is currently struggling to clear the $7,650 resistance. There is also a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair.

It goes on to say that the banks have many challenges and opportunities in this digital age but they must regain the public’s trust to remain relevant. “They can remain relevant by providing more stable units of account than crypto assets and by making central bank money attractive as a medium of exchange in the digital economy,” the IMF paper concludes.\nWhat do you think about the IMF’s report and how positive this organization is towards cryptocurrencies?

This is certainly the case with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have emerged over the last several years. As policymakers and regulators start to focus more attention on these currencies, now is a perfect time to examine the myths that have sprung up around them.\nMyth 1: Bitcoin is Blockchain, and Blockchain is Bitcoin\nThe first myth is wrapped in confusion and misunderstanding. Simply put, Bitcoin is not blockchain. And yet, the misunderstanding persists; the words “Bitcoin” and “blockchain” are so often used together that the words have become practically interchangeable.\nThe only connection between bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) and blockchain is simply this: blockchain is just one of several technological components and constructs used to manage cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nBlockchain is a decentralized ledger that is securely viewed by all parties with permission to join the chain. When a new transaction is added to a blockchain, the “chain” grows by one; each transaction typically includes a new sequence number and date, identification of the owner, and the associated value or set of other parameters defined specifically for the transaction. Importantly, blockchains can be permissionless (public), or permission-based (private), depending on how participants decide to set up the technology.\nBitcoin works because it leverages blockchain to manage values and transactions. Blockchain is the underlying technology—but it has many other potential uses across all enterprise activities, including finance, supply chains, and human resources.\nMyth 2: Blockchains Are All About Managing Money\nWhile blockchains can (and are) being used to manage financial transactions, that’s just one of many applications of the technology. A blockchain can track any type of transaction—from the movement of goods through a supply chain, to the completion of courses a student needs to earn a degree. My colleague, David Haimes, recently wrote about potential use cases for blockchain technology , and there are many more under consideration by various organizations.\nThe remarkable value of blockchain technology is its potential to streamline transactions while increasing insight into transactional activity. Without blockchain, transactions of all types—whether they are financial or supply chain-related—require data flows in and out of central information systems. With blockchain, ownership is easier to follow and any associated party can confirm event activity. Transaction transparency, trust, and tracking are comprehensive and very efficient.\nMyth 3: Blockchain Consumes Insane Amounts of Energy\nMy favorite blockchain myth highlights the electrical power consumption required to power blockchains. The myth has variations, but it basically follows this proposition: in the future, more and more blockchains will consume electricity comparable to that of small nations around the world.\nThis construct started about two years ago with a simple spreadsheet analysis from a consulting firm. This spreadsheet estimated the Bitcoin network was currently consuming as much electricity in one year as Denmark’s annual national power consumption. More recent studies have increased this estimate to the electrical consumption of larger countries like Austria or Ireland.\nWhile this might be true for Bitcoin’s network, remember that Bitcoin and blockchain are not synonymous. Cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology; blockchain technology is not exclusive to cryptocurrencies.\nAs mentioned earlier, most blockchains fall into two categories : permissionless and permissioned. A blockchain may be accessed by anyone, or only by certain participants.\nPermissionless (public) blockchain: Access open to everyone.\nBitcoin’s blockchain is an example of a permissionless network; it is open source and anyone may participate in it. While this type of network has its advantages (i.e. no one entity controls it, and anyone can audit it), it does have drawbacks. Permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin consume enormous amounts of computing power because of “mining”; this is what drives comparative estimates of electrical consumption equivalent to one or more countries.\nWith a permissionless blockchain network, mining is deployed to ensure trust and helps the network be practically tamper-resistant. Mining involves extensive mathematical calculations that must be completed through networked computers to process lengthy and complex algorithms. When a correct answer is reached, those running the calculations—the “miners”—receive a new bitcoin of a predetermined value.\nThis process utilizes millions of computations per second using servers located around the world. Because of the lengthy computational requirements, this mining process is very energy intensive.\nPermissioned (private) blockchain: Access restricted.\nWith permissioned blockchains, participants seeking to join the network are vetted and must be granted permission into the network. The process of mining is not necessary since the governing body or trusted participants of the network validate information across the chain. With no data mining required, energy consumption for a permissioned blockchain becomes a non-issue.\nExamine Your Assumptions\nThese myths and misperceptions highlight why it is always important to not only understand the foundation and application of any new technology, but also the implications and impacts. Underlying assumptions, sometimes simplistically extrapolated from guestimates in spreadsheets, can lead to overzealous and ungrounded predictions that can discourage early adopters from exploring a promising technology.\nMost importantly, these fears and extrapolations typically divert attention from serious conversations involving important new technologies and their potential uses in business applications for enterprise environments. This is why it’s important to examine the facts closely, and not let myths overcome reality. When building the business of tomorrow, it’s crucial that you give your team every opportunity to leverage emerging technologies for business benefits and competitive advantage, today.\nHow will new technologies like blockchain influence the finance profession?

With more than $100M processed in tips in 2018, alone, cryptocurrencies have officially entered a substantial and growing market. Tip with Cryptocurrency Streamlabs is a popular streaming application which allows people to seamlessly broadcast content on the most popular platforms, such as Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Mixer. Amongst other things, the software also allows viewers to tip the streamers, hence incentivizing valuable output and providing financial aid to content creators. In an official announcement , Streamlabs shared the news that its broadcasters will be able to receive their tips in cryptocurrencies. Initially, the streaming app will support Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash — but the development team also made it clear that it’d be looking to expand to other cryptocurrencies in the nearest future. Coinbase Partnership The team has attempted to make the entire process simple by entering into a partnership with Coinbase . There is a Coinbase option in the settings page which redirects to the popular cryptocurrency exchange. Once the user has registered there, his or her tip page will automatically show a new option, enabling them to tip with cryptocurrency. Tips of the kind will have the same features as regular donations, but they won’t be reversible. Even though Streamlabs says that it won’t charge a fee, it’s also made clear that transaction fees might apply based on the preferred cryptocurrency. Furthermore, fees are to be incurred when you decide to convert your tips into fiat on Coinbase. Cryptocurrencies Entering a Growing Market Research shows that Twitch users managed to stream more than 2 billion hours in the first quarter of 2018. Yet, it’s not the only streaming platform out there. Streamlabs alone supports YouTube, Facebook, and Mixer — with Hitbox support is in the pipeline. Streamlabs managed to process over $100M in tips for the year of 2017, according to another official statement .

Bitcoin mining rigs are currently easily imported into Vietnam. This proposal follows the largest crypto fraud case in the country involving over $656 million and more than 32,000 victims. Also read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Ministry of Finance’s Proposal In the recently released report containing the opinions of the ministries involved in the management of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Vietnam, the country’s Ministry of Finance proposes suspending the importation of mining equipment, according to local media. This report, referred to as Document 5964 / BTC-TCHQ, has been submitted to the country’s prime minister. Zing.vn publication elaborated: According to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures. The ministry outlined in its report that the use of mining equipment for bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country is difficult for the authority to manage. “From there, it is easy for people to use [cryptocurrencies] as a currency or another method of payment,” the City Economic News Kinhte & Dothi quoted the ministry. “This is in violation of the amended government Decree 101 on non-cash payments,” Zing.vn conveyed. The publication also noted that data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs shows that “from 2017 to half of 4/2018, the country imported about 15,600 mining machines,” adding that most of them were imported into Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Last year, more than 9,300 rigs were imported into Vietnam and over 6,300 rigs were imported in the first four months of this year. Decision to Ban Mining Imports The ministry also referred the case where Modern Tech Corp in Ho Chi Minh City was “accused [of] over VND 15 trillion [~US$656 million] of fraud by more than 32,000 people through its Ifan and Pincoin virtual currency investment models.” According to the ministry, protecting the Vietnamese people from similar scams in the future “requires state management agencies to take strict control measures with the import and use of this commodity.” The Vnexpress reiterated: To prevent other possible events, in the immediate future, the Ministry of Finance proposed to apply the import suspension measures for the above types of mining equipment. The Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently signed a directive to strengthen “the management of activities related to bitcoin and other virtual currencies,” as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .

He was quizzed over his connections with Amit Bhardwaj, said to be the scam mastermind.\nSpeaking to reporters outside the ED office, Kundra said: \"We thought Amit Bhardwaj is a respectable person so we allotted him a team. ED wanted me to be a witness in the scam by Amit Bharadwaj. Amit Bharadwaj was interested in buying a team in our poker league. He wanted to pay in bitcoins which we refused. His contract was terminated after he failed to make the payments. I have become a witness for ED in the case.\"\nED officials had earlier told India Today TV that they would decide \"whether Raj Kundra is an accused or an investor in the Bitcoin scam\" only after recording his statement.\nKundra was straight away taken to the interrogation room where, in the earlier rounds, he was questioned by the investigating officer (IO) of the bitcoin case, but soon a senior ED official took over on reportedly finding Kundra's answers unsatisfactory, and quizzed him for another few hours.\nAccording to ED, Kundra is one of the many celebrities who had promoted Bhardwaj's ponzy schemes and helped him arrange investors from outside India.\nIn 2017, Bhardwaj had organised a bitcoin event in Dubai, which was attended by thousands of investors. \"Last year, prominent faces of Bollywood and television world, publicly promoted the visionary plans of Bhardwaj, especially on social media. In addition, mobile videos were created inviting investors to attend the Dubai mega-event. Later, these videos were circulated on social media platforms, promoting Bhardwaj's bitcoin scheme,\" an official told India Today TV.\nAn ED official told India Today TV that this was merely the tip of the iceberg, as many other celebrities will be summoned soon. Bhardwaj is the main accused in Rs 2,000 crore Bitcoin scam.\nThe Pune Police's cybercrime cell arrested him. Bhardwaj was the founder of Amaze Mining & Research Ltd and the author of 'Bitcoin for Beginners'. He created a multilevel marketing (MLM) scheme using his website Gainbitcoin.com and assured a 10 per cent return on each bitcoin investment.\nAs a result, thousands of investors were duped. After Bhardwaj's arrest, the ED registered an Enforcement Case Investigation Report (ECIR) against him for violation of virtual currencies under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit bharadwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "india today t", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T16:20:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4657c400ba13e959067593da3f928c5085e71463", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Tw4osnvn6RG1oisM4Y1jYDTUqU.6DCWRWYr0TcprjMy2q.OHcSTtI_yM.YVupCPA2_KT6769yUMxZZRWUVo7tTaAlJMOhouIhg1UCEughO3VB9un5IvYRu2PyAZ1x59VRZYLIYjHjtyPmczJBejw9", "site_full": "www.masala.com", "site": "masala.com", "site_section": "http://masala.com//celeb-feed.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "Masala.com", "title": "Bitcoin Scam: Raj Kundra Allegedly Names Sunny Leone and Neha Dhupia Among Other Bollywood Celebs", "title_full": "Bitcoin Scam: Raj Kundra Allegedly Names Sunny Leone and Neha Dhupia Among Other Bollywood Celebs", "published": "2018-06-06T10:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.masala.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/06/06/_d63f9840-68a0-11e8-8b70-a9b23b84985b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 57158, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4657c400ba13e959067593da3f928c5085e71463", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Tw4osnvn6RG1oisM4Y1jYDTUqU.6DCWRWYr0TcprjMy2q.OHcSTtI_yM.YVupCPA2_KT6769yUMxZZRWUVo7tTaAlJMOhouIhg1UCEughO3VB9un5IvYRu2PyAZ1x59VRZYLIYjHjtyPmczJBejw9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T10:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Scam: Raj Kundra Allegedly Names Sunny Leone and Neha Dhupia Among Other Bollywood Celebs", "text": "Bitcoin Scam: Raj Kundra Allegedly Names Sunny Leone and Neha Dhupia Among Other Bollywood Celebs Bitcoin Scam: Raj Kundra Allegedly Names Sunny Leone and Neha Dhupia Among Other Bollywood Celebs Raj Kundra was interrogated for over 9-hours in the on-going Bitcoin case\nRaj Kundra has had a rather vexatious day at the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) office where he was summoned yesterday in connection with the Bitcoin scam amounting to more than Rs. 2,400 crore. Shilpa Shetty’s flamboyant husband was reportedly interrogated for over nine hours about his alleged dealings with Amit Bhardwaj who is known everywhere as the kingpin of the cryptocurrency market. Bhardwaj was arrested two months ago in Delhi and a criminal case filed against him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\nAt the time, Kundra was being interrogated, sources said he revealed the names of several Bollywood celebs who helped him promote the ponzi scheme GainBitcoin for its founder Amit Bhardwaj in Dubai. About 8,000 investors lost over Rs. 2,000 crore by transacting in this scheme. The names given out by Kundra to ED officers include those of Sunny Leone, Prachi Desai, Aarti Chhabria, Sonal Chouhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan and Neha Dhupia. It is almost certain all of these Bollywood starlets will also be interrogated by the ED for their role in the Bitcoin scam.\nMeanwhile, Kundra just released a statement in which the businessman says: “This is to clarify that I have no connection or involvement in the Bitcoin scam whatsoever. I was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate merely as a witness. An inquiry is underway and I am cooperating with the law enforcement agency as Amit Bhardwaj is an acquaintance and protocol is being followed. Amit Bhardwaj was to buy a team in Match Poker League and had got into contact with us and I have come as a witness to the same.” Kundra is said to own the Match Poker League in which a number of city teams have to play for the title.\nHe took to Twitter to speak up on the same and wrote:\nHowever, an ED source reportedly told the media, “We suspect certain Bitcoin transactions between the main accused Amit Bhardwaj and Raj Kundra. And we are investigating Kundra to ascertain if he has gained anything from it. Kundra and Bhardwaj might have some links in Hash mining for Bitcoin in China.” The FIR registered in Delhi mentioned that Bhardwaj’s company duped hundreds of investors in a ponzi scheme. The case was filed after he was arrested by Pune Police at Delhi Airport following a complaint registered against him in the Pune Police’s Cyber Crime Cell by one Bhimsen Agarwal.\nWatch this space for more updates on the case.\nNote: This article is reproduced with permission from Peepingmoon.com Tags /", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "https://www.peepingmoon.com/", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T10:33:09.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93209d8be6a1e6bd457aed0a3ce7e6297180347b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcLLdQhJeyGotr6.sAzWGng-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=217.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Collectibles", "title": "[Auction] NEW BTCC Mint: 2018 One Bitcoin & One Tenth Bitcoin, V-Series Titanium", "title_full": "[Auction] NEW BTCC Mint: 2018 One Bitcoin & One Tenth Bitcoin, V-Series Titanium", "published": "2018-06-06T10:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93209d8be6a1e6bd457aed0a3ce7e6297180347b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcLLdQhJeyGotr6.sAzWGng-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bobbyclee", "published": "2018-06-06T10:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "[Auction] NEW BTCC Mint: 2018 One Bitcoin & One Tenth Bitcoin, V-Series Titanium", "text": "Quote: from: anonymousminer on June 06, 2018, 02:07:55 AM Quote: from: BTCC_Official on June 06, 2018, 12:19:01 AM\nYes, indeed!

This was in reaction to what was going on in the currency markets, as the EUR\\/USD pair rallied. With the softness in the US dollar, it makes sense that bitcoin would be able to gain from this move. However, I think there is significant resistance above at the $8000 level that you should be paying attention to, and I think that it will be difficult to break above that level. I suspect that any short-term bounce will be short-lived to say the least. I think that $7000 will be tested again rather soon. If we did break above the $8000 level, we could go looking towards the $8500 level next. I have no interest in trying to buy this market currently, it has shown far too much in the way of weakness over the last several months.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin also fell against the Japanese yen initially during the trading session on Tuesday but found enough buyers to turn around of form a bit of a hammer as I record this. I think that ultimately this market will probably continue to find a lot of volatility, and most certainly downward pressure. I think that we are going to revisit the ¥700,000 level eventually, and it’s only a matter of time before we get there. I look at rallies as opportunities to sell, as this market has not been able to sustain gains for any significant amount of time. I anticipate that the ¥1 million level will continue to act as a “ceiling” in the pair and breaking above that is going to be very difficult.\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

The country's Finance Ministry is proposing a ban on the importation of cryptocurrency mining rigs. According to the ministry, these mining rigs are used to launch unregulated digital payment methods.\nVietnam Struggles to Get a Handle on Cryptocurrency The entire spectrum of Vietnam's digital currency regulations is thus; \"cryptocurrencies are illegal in the country.\" However, this stipulation hasn't stopped the occurrence of fraudulent activities in the country.\nIn April 2018, news emerged of a $658 million ICO scam that defrauded more than 30,000 people. The affected people invested in a company which promised significant returns on the mining of iFan and Pincoin cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to the ministry, mining rigs imported into the country are and were used to create new cryptocurrencies and unregulated payment systems. It is the belief that many of these mining activities are set up to defraud unsuspecting investors. Thus, the ministry is calling for a ban on all mining rig imports to combat the activities of fraudsters.\nThis proposed ban follows Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc's directive for stricter regulation of the market. Based on the directive, credit institutions in the country may not facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. Financial regulators and the Justice Ministry are also responsible for ensuring virtual currency stakeholders abide by the country's anti-money laundering regulations.\nVietnam's need for a robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework came to the fore in September 2017. The country's tax authorities were unable to secure an indictment against a Bitcoin trader who had made quite a fortune, thanks to a lack of legal provisions under which the tax body could charge the trader with tax evasion — highlighting the country's need for a clear regulatory framework.\nCryptocurrency Mining in Vietnam Even though cryptocurrencies are illegal in the country, Vietnam imports thousands of mining rigs annually.\nAccording to the General Department of Vietnam Customs, more than 6,300 mining rigs were imported into the country between January and April 2018. Last year, Vietnam imported almost 10,000 mining rigs.\nSaigon, Hanoi, and Da Nang are the principal cryptocurrency mining areas in the country.\nWill the ban on cryptocurrency mining rigs help the government prevent cryptocurrency-related fraud?

The District Court's verdict was released in July 2016 in line with the ban on cryptocurrencies - because digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, were not legal in this country.\nAs reported by TASS, a new decision was passed after the Supreme Court of Russia referred the case to the St. Petersburg Metropolitan Court, after filing a complaint from the owner of Bitcoininfo website. \"The court in St. Petersburg annulled the decision of the District Court, which recognized the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website as prohibited for viewing.\"\nThe Court's press service also announced that in July 2016 the District Court in St. Petersburg prohibited the use of the website at the request of local prosecutors. The case was heard by the court without the presence of website owners. According to the Bitcoininfo representative, the application process was unilaterally initiated by prosecutors without involving website owners and without requesting removal of content deemed illegal. He also noted that the Municipal Court refused to accept the application for an appeal after the ban.\nBased on case files, local prosecutors demanded a ban on the website because it contained information about crypts that are \"out of government control\", \"facilitate the growth of the shadow economy\" and \"do not have specific consumer characteristics\".\nThe Municipal Court in St. Petersburg annulled previous court decisions prohibiting the operation of 40 websites related to Bitcoin in the Russian Federation. Initially, the ban was initiated because the websites disseminated information about the digital currency \"which is not supported by any real resource and does not provide information about its owners\". The court's decision is preceded by the upcoming regulatory framework for cryptography, which is scheduled for July 1, by the decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin. These frameworks are supported by the Legislative Work Committee of the Russian State Duma and include a bill on 'Digital financial assets', which was released in March this year.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market had tested the golden trend line from below and bounced back up from it towards the weekly pivot at the level of $7,523. Nevertheless, to reassure a valid bounce the price must break through the intraday resistance at the level of $7,752 and head towards the level of $7,890. Otherwise, the bear will make their presence visible again and will try to push the prices lower towards the technical support at the level of $7,232.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

According to the Bitcoininfo representative, the application process was unilaterally initiated by prosecutors without involving website owners and without requesting removal of content deemed illegal. He also noted that the Municipal Court refused to accept the application for an appeal after the ban.\nBased on case files, local prosecutors demanded a ban on the website because it contained information about crypts that are \"out of government control\", \"facilitate the growth of the shadow economy\" and \"do not have specific consumer characteristics\".\nThe Municipal Court in St. Petersburg annulled previous court decisions prohibiting the operation of 40 websites related to Bitcoin in the Russian Federation. Initially, the ban was initiated because the websites disseminated information about the digital currency \"which is not supported by any real resource and does not provide information about its owners\". The court's decision is preceded by the upcoming regulatory framework for cryptography, which is scheduled for July 1, by the decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin. These frameworks are supported by the Legislative Work Committee of the Russian State Duma and include a bill on 'Digital financial assets', which was released in March this year.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market had tested the golden trend line from below and bounced back up from it towards the weekly pivot at the level of $7,523. Nevertheless, to reassure a valid bounce the price must break through the intraday resistance at the level of $7,752 and head towards the level of $7,890. Otherwise, the bear will make their presence visible again and will try to push the prices lower towards the technical support at the level of $7,232.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "municipal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg metropolitan court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoininfo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T00:44:58.072+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "119b43c30944f07de076fd040963dc7e1ede8060", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPRWjyY3dIFsP6NGj7rxTArJO6GqFQPY88rhD2da2fCBRLaJhisihrsyg7yaAh8CmkTIKXLoKQhoIw0ywmriBpE1iE00fwT60-", "site_full": "homelessmens.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://homelessmens.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "THE HOMELESS MAN", "title": "cryptotab mine bitcoin 2018", "title_full": "cryptotab mine bitcoin 2018", "published": "2018-06-06T09:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "119b43c30944f07de076fd040963dc7e1ede8060", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPRWjyY3dIFsP6NGj7rxTArJO6GqFQPY88rhD2da2fCBRLaJhisihrsyg7yaAh8CmkTIKXLoKQhoIw0ywmriBpE1iE00fwT60-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rashad 34434 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T09:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "cryptotab mine bitcoin 2018", "text": "https://get.com/1532310 how i get bitcoin everyday join with the link thank and have a good year", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T09:47:55.066+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9880871532e7a0645bc0b44caa190a567ff572ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUQhBCRu7cE9wpSiQvafTo8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Charity Accepting Bitcoins?", "title_full": "Charity Accepting Bitcoins?", "published": "2018-06-06T09:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.845, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9880871532e7a0645bc0b44caa190a567ff572ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUQhBCRu7cE9wpSiQvafTo8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Choyor", "published": "2018-06-06T09:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Charity Accepting Bitcoins?", "text": "Quote: from: Botude23 on March 20, 2018, 05:53:40 AM If there is a charity accepting bitcoins do you prefer to give some of yours\nMe: I will if there is, but for now I don't have yet.\nEDITED:\nYeah it a hassle for now.\nAnother question : But what if there is fiat will be disappear in the future and crypto will conquered the world and all payment transactions will be on blockchain system?\nSo is this applicable right?\nLet's make it as simple as possible, we can do charity without having a system that accommodates for us to do charity with Bitcoin, Bitcoin can not be converted into money, I think so will be more simple and episien.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T12:44:14.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a37eff950e6cd049c212f5df2f6316f74c241a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSWiUzmFrjV3P6_f4m49B44cYOhuuwfHxhgjw26WpXgtkf9KnkkYgAAgRHfWoPA1mC6sqMjxo8Q.n", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "What is in my hand?

Price needs to break past the neckline around $7,800 to confirm that an uptrend is about to take place. Technical indicators are still reflecting the presence of bearish momentum, so it could be uphill from here.\nBitcoin price has formed a classic reversal pattern to signal that the downtrend might be over soon.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to show that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nThe 100 SMA is also holding as dynamic resistance at the moment, so bitcoin price would need to surge past a couple of upside barriers before confirming a rally. The 200 SMA dynamic inflection point might also hold as a ceiling around $8,200. Also, the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum.\nRSI is on the move up but appears to be stalling as it closes in on the overbought zone. Turning back down could draw bears in and force bitcoin price to resume the slide. Stochastic has more room to climb so bitcoin price could follow suit and attempt a neckline break.\nThe chart pattern is approximately $900 tall so a breakout could lead to a rally of the same height, taking bitcoin price to $8,600 next. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nThere appear to be no clear catalysts for the latest bounce, with many simply attributing this to a pickup in overall risk appetite. This follows a resolution of the political crisis in Italy and confirmation that the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-Un will push through next week.\nAt the same time, the dollar is taking some weight on Trump’s decision to slap higher tariffs on metal imports from its allies. Bitcoin could be poised to take advantage of risk rallies and dollar weakness from here.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Waiting for Reversal Confirmation appeared first on NewsBTC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T10:52:38.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e55f36759d05d75504d2c07103a73109716ed7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYCVMLeXTu8AhxIwQGLiFYs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=180.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Haberleri", "title": "Avustralyada Havalimanında Bitcoin İle Alışveriş Yapılabilecek", "title_full": "Avustralyada Havalimanında Bitcoin İle Alışveriş Yapılabilecek", "published": "2018-06-06T09:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.212, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e55f36759d05d75504d2c07103a73109716ed7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYCVMLeXTu8AhxIwQGLiFYs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kriptokoin", "published": "2018-06-06T09:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Avustralyada Havalimanında Bitcoin İle Alışveriş Yapılabilecek", "text": "Avusrtalyanın Brisbane şehrindeki havalimanı Bitcoin ve kripto paralarla ödemeleri kabul etmeye başladı.

However, wallet growth was roughly 2% percent in both April and May.\nAccording to Colas, Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention. He added that “This dog will have its day, but today isn’t it. While we love the idea of Bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.”\nBitcoin price chart:\nBitcoin prices have been struggling this year, especially compared to the all-time high in December. However, interest in Bitcoin is struggling too: Google searches for the term have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months.\nMeanwhile, ICOs are struggling as well. Although the total for this year (USD 9.1 billion) already shot past the total for the entirety of 2017 (USD 6.6 billion), when removing EOS (USD 4.1 billion raised) and Telegram (USD 1.8 billion raised), the monthly trend look severely down. Research by Autonomous Next implies that this dragging is due to “continued regulatory uncertainty, tax overhang, and a lack of tangible progress in software adoption by the mainstream consumer.”\nHowever, the research firm goes on to say that we may be “entering the era of mega deals.” Japan is already moving forward with the crypto craze: from Rakuten , an e-commerce and Internet company, tokenizing USD 9 billion of loyalty points, to Mitsubishi bank talking about launching a cryptocurrency. And although last year, most of the projects were built by new teams, this year we are seeing a surge of mid-stage companies (50-250 employees) tokenizing some asset of their existing operations. This implies the possibility of late-stage companies entering the market soon as well, according to Autonomous Next.\n“Just look at the Internet wave: March 2000 was the peak value share a percentage of market capitalizations. Despite the crash, the web has never been more present or important than today.

BTC/USD has two targets\nAfter rising from the lows, the price of Bitcoin faces an initial hurdle at $ 7,598 which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 38.2% one’day, the Simple Moving Average 5’1d, the SMA 100’1h, the 4h’high, and the Bolinger Band one-hour Middle.\nYet it faces two higher and more interesting targets above: $ 7,743 is the confluence of the Fibonacci 23.6% one-month, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, and the Bolinger Band one-day Middle. Further above, the $ 81,78 level is the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month which is backed up by the SMA 200-4h.\nLooking down, Bitcoin has some support waiting at $ 7,453 which is the congestion of the Simple Moving Average 50-15m, the SMA 10-1h, the Bolinger Band 15m-Middle Stdv. 2.2, the SMA-5, the SMA-10-one day, the Bolinger Band one-hour Middle, and the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week\nFurther down, $ 7,053 is the meeting point of the one-month low and the one-week low.\nThis is how it looks: ETH/USD major breakout\nThe Ethereum Price moved above a major level of resistance around $ 600 . This is the congestion of the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the 4h-high, the Bolinger Band 1h-Middle, the Simple Moving Average 200-15m, the Bolinger Band 15m-Upper, the SMA 50-1h, and the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper.\nEarlier, ETH/USD moved above $ 593 which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the one-week high, the SMA 10-15m, and the SMA 5-1d.\nSo, what’s next? $ 648 remains a key target: it is the confluence of the all-important Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2, the Fibonacci 161.8% one-week, and the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 2. Above that level, there are no significant limits at least until $ 700 .\nHere is how it looks: XRP/USD has further targets\nThe price of Ripple is moving up as well and faces a clear resistance area around $ 0.6970 . At this level, XRP/USD meets the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month, the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 1, and the Simple Moving Average 200-4h.\nThe next target is $ 0.7366 which is the convergence of the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 3 and the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2.\nLooking down, support awaits at $ 0.6525 is the confluence of the Bolinger Band 15m-Lower, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, and the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day. Lower, $ 0.6366 is a support line as it is the one-day high and the Fibonacci 23.6% one-month, a very powerful line.\nThis is how it looks:\nThe Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\nThis tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.forexcrunch.com/", "https://www.forexcrunch.com/category/crypto-news/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T09:58:07.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0122735830d6bebbcdf28b40fca967d5f435f5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9.9TXUU_siMkzkQB7HTasNbvXQgGdBSkH4GkTwlQTa_aXkf_V5MMZ72JL987ErG9lbga3eFt8deFHMxgecnWP2m66PP2nH.qdjujuJgfTYtl", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple set their eyes on higher targets", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple set their eyes on higher targets", "published": "2018-06-06T08:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0122735830d6bebbcdf28b40fca967d5f435f5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9.9TXUU_siMkzkQB7HTasNbvXQgGdBSkH4GkTwlQTa_aXkf_V5MMZ72JL987ErG9lbga3eFt8deFHMxgecnWP2m66PP2nH.qdjujuJgfTYtl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Forex Crunch", "published": "2018-06-06T08:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple set their eyes on higher targets", "text": "Home / Forex Analysis / Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple set their eyes on higher targets Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple set their eyes on higher targets Posted by: Forex Crunch in Forex Analysis 4 mins ago\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are on the rise after dropping over the weekend.

Wozniak explained that he used blockchain to make secure payments while travelling abroad.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,” said Wozniak, who also owns two ether coins.\nHe announced recently that he has sold all but one bitcoin. The world’s top digital currency was trading at $7,454 on Tuesday.\nCurrently, there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but Wozniak says that bitcoin is the only one that remains “pure” because others have had to give up some of the aspects that makes bitcoin what it is.\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control.
