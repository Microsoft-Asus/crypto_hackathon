The currency had recently been tested at $9,800, and was unable to surpass $10,000 mark over the weekend as so many analysts and users were hoping. It fell to $9,500 the following day, $9,300 after that, and ultimately settled at $9,100 during yesterday’s early morning hours. Overall, the total drop amounted to $700 over the course of three days. Now that the currency has moved up, many are wondering if the bulls have once again taken the reins and are pushing bitcoin back up the financial hill. One source verifies that this might be true, and predicts that the coin could move beyond $15,000 by the end of the year. This is largely attributed to the new bitcoin trading desk up by Goldman Sachs. The sentiment remains that other Wall Street entities will follow in Goldman Sachs’ footsteps and try to pave the way for further cryptocurrency trades in the “big leagues.” In fact, this is already starting to occur. Intercontinental Exchange (which owns the New York Stock Exchange) has been developing plans for a new trading platform that could potentially allow investors to buy and hold multiple forms of crypto. Digital currency trading could suddenly move from “obscure” to the “norm” in the coming months, and hike up both awareness and the present market cap’s value. It is also mentioned that many cryptocurrency exchanges must now register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may seem scary at first, but is likely to bring further legitimacy to the industry in the long run. This legitimacy is certain to up both the price and the value of bitcoin and its many crypto-cousins, pushing the arena into further mainstream territory and carving a path that leads to spikes in trading. The source forecasts changes in both the number of users and transaction volumes for each month over the rest of 2018. By examining the present data, it suggests a much stronger fundamental value for bitcoin, and believes that the price of the coin will grow steadily over the coming months as mainstream financial institutions continue to show acceptance. In addition, many analysts and financial experts are boosting bitcoin’s reputation by promoting its benefits and working against the actions and words of figures like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. One of those people is Mark Wright, a BBC Apprentice winner and bitcoin investor. As a huge advocate for cryptocurrency, Wright completely disagrees with Buffett’s recent claims, commenting: “Despite its volatile nature, the cryptocurrency sector has soared in recent years, with experts predicting it will hit a market valuation of $1 trillion by the close of 2018. This figure proves that Buffett is wrong, particularly when one accounts for how the value of bitcoin has developed since 2014 – the time when Buffett first expressed negative opinions on the sector. Despite his years of experience in business, Buffett’s comments show a terrible lack of engagement in technology and innovation.” Bob Loukas – founder of Bitcoin.Live – agrees with Mark Wright. He mentions that bitcoin is beginning to gain trust in the financial marketplace, and that over time, healthy regulation will set it on the right path and allow for the currency to grow significantly. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:12:09.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2936496f271824fd040bcb46d1af4efd0f11d8d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCQlNgqzIjKkeL6Yc_vdYUsxboPOb6yZT32eqCP4uRHCxUciSTt_yVHgTF8IEMnyodII1LElKujHgvBzK.bcpMjFVh4LOfDF2rEvC1x.FIgtc-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitmain’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Rival Plots $1 Billion Hong Kong IPO", "title_full": "Bitmain’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Rival Plots $1 Billion Hong Kong IPO", "published": "2018-05-10T03:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2936496f271824fd040bcb46d1af4efd0f11d8d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCQlNgqzIjKkeL6Yc_vdYUsxboPOb6yZT32eqCP4uRHCxUciSTt_yVHgTF8IEMnyodII1LElKujHgvBzK.bcpMjFVh4LOfDF2rEvC1x.FIgtc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitmain’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Rival Plots $1 Billion Hong Kong IPO", "text": "3 hours ago Crypto World News CryptoCoinNews 52 Canaan Creative, China’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer, plans to raise $1 billion through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK).

Unlike currencies in the conventional banking system, Bitcoin works without a central bank or system administrator and transactions are usually priced for a minimal fee, or most of the time, for free. Bitcoin is the largest form of cryptocurrency, a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to make transactions extremely secure . While it remains as a relatively new phenomenon, more and more people, establishments, and firms use bitcoins to buy and sell products and services. Bitcoins, according to websites that provide these offerings, can be bought or sold through “Bitcoin exchanges” via different currencies or mined by computers solving complex arithmetic problems. The general public is now realizing that this may not be a risk-free, get-rich-quick, investment opportunity and interest has been fading away with many diverse opinions coming into picture. For instance, Warren Buffet lately described these to be not worth a consideration. ‘When you buy non-productive assets, all you’re counting on whether the next person is going to pay you more, because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along,’ Buffett said. ‘The asset itself is creating nothing. Basically, no body knows what exactly bitcoin is’, something he emphasized on . On the other hand, Bitcoin has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world, and for some it is still said to be becoming a revolutionary asset. Particularly, the news that the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE establishing an online trading platform to help large investors trade in this cryptocurrency in terms of buying and holding Bitcoin has given a spark to the otherwise subsiding trend as seen in the last couple of days. This move has been unearthed from emails and documents that were viewed by The New York Times and few anonymous personalities. This follows the recent support to cryptocurrency from Goldman Sachs that intends to open a Bitcoin trading unit at a Wall Street bank. As of now, details of the platform are yet to be uncovered and remain confidential . What made the currency so popular was the meteoric rise of its value – from over US $960 per bitcoin in January last year to about US $20,000 in December 2017. While the currency is almost down 50% now, some of the biggest names on Wall Street are gearing up to trade in Bitcoin, through the above virtual platform. While the skepticism remains high, and the trends over the last few months have been sinusoidal but needless to say that if you decide to invest in bitcoins you’ll need nerves of steel given the risk factor. On the other hand, by virtue of this, blockchain technology has gained lot of traction and has become useful representing innovation in information registration and distribution that eliminates the need for a trusted party to facilitate digital relationships. This has been, thus, referred to an orchestration of three technologies (the Internet, private key cryptography and a protocol governing incentivization), by many experts.

It traded around $9,300 on Thursday. The researcher’s call was based in part on the notion that improving cryptocurrency mining economics support price appreciation.\n“Bitcoin miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees,” Fundstrat said. “We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.”\nFundstrat’s latest call comes three days after managing partner Tom Lee predicted the price of Bitcoin will rally during Consensus, a major virtual-currency conference next week in Manhattan that is expected to draw more than 6,500 attendees. At the time, Fundstrat estimated that the top digital token will cost $25,000 by the end of this year, though its projections have varied substantially over time. The researchers forecast in January that Bitcoin would be worth $125,000 by 2022.\n--With assistance from Luke Kawa .\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lily Katz in New York at lkatz31@bloomberg.net.\nTo contact the editors Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Andrew Dunn\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T21:16:38.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b701fab0a4188e5773cbf0625629ef8d4ba17982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRu4edIwDkdVvt0R8Z_MXibIAnLN_sRoUUJjuZooX1L6jVoHJtL2ZlCXxNvwmIRC_ZWr5_w7k.YC0CVJtCATqrOHpJrOtchm0Q-", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Money Worth Technical Evaluation – BCH/USD Breaks Key Resistance 2018 – Crypto Addict", "title_full": "Bitcoin Money Worth Technical Evaluation – BCH/USD Breaks Key Resistance 2018 – Crypto Addict", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.okas.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TA-BCH.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b701fab0a4188e5773cbf0625629ef8d4ba17982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRu4edIwDkdVvt0R8Z_MXibIAnLN_sRoUUJjuZooX1L6jVoHJtL2ZlCXxNvwmIRC_ZWr5_w7k.YC0CVJtCATqrOHpJrOtchm0Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Money Worth Technical Evaluation – BCH/USD Breaks Key Resistance 2018 – Crypto Addict", "text": "Bitcoin Money Worth Technical Evaluation – BCH/USD Breaks Key Resistance By okas Posted on May 10, 2018 Key Factors Bitcoin money worth discovered assist close to the $1,460 stage and recovered properly towards the US Greenback.

Foundation Founder Charlie Shrem Joins XYO Network Advisory Board\nThe XYO Network announces today that Charlie Shrem has joined the Board of Advisors. Shrem is a bitcoin pioneer, social economist, digital currency trader and is currently the founder of Crypto.IQ. His work in this field is legendary.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/\nCharlie Shrem (Photo: Business Wire)\nIn 2011, at the dawn of the crypto era, Shrem founded BitInstant, the first and largest Bitcoin company. In 2013, he founded the Bitcoin Foundation and served as its Vice Chairman. Since then, Charlie has advised more than a dozen digital currency companies, launched and managed numerous partnerships between crypto and non-crypto companies, and is the go-to guy for some of the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs. He recently started Crypto.IQ, a premier advisory firm providing expert research, education and advice in the world of crypto assets. In short, he is the ultimate insider at the epicenter.\nShrem was an early change-maker for bitcoin, identifying some of the initial challenges and quickly working to overcome them so that it could be adopted on a mass scale. His company BitInstant was born out of the frustration of losing bitcoins due to long transaction times. At one time, it processed 30% of all bitcoin transactions. Shrem is responsible for bringing cryptocurrency to the masses by partnering with MoneyGram to allow cash deposits for bitcoin at over 700,000 US locations.\n“Shrem’s first hand experience with both the actual and perceived limitations of digital currency, followed by rapid innovation to overcome them, is exactly what we need to introduce a new cryptolocation technology on a massive and global scale,” said XYO Network co-founder Markus Levin.\nThe XYO Network is the next generation of GPS technology as it provides an efficient and foolproof way to deliver trustworthy location through cryptolocation technology that protects privacy while providing greater accuracy. With a platform of over one million connected beacon devices already in circulation, the blockchain technology can jump from the online realm into the real world with precise physical coordinates.\nAs the world leader in blockchain location technology, the XYO Network can serve as an Internet of Things (IoT) backbone for smart cities of the future. It can power everything from automated parking payments to traffic flow optimization, self-driving cars, autonomous drone delivery, airline luggage tracking, e-commerce, and many additional applications. It can even extend beyond the Earth to vehicle and equipment location services on the Moon or even Mars.\nFor additional information, visit xyo.network .\nAbout XYO Network:\nXYO Network built the world’s first decentralized location verification system with more than one million location tracking devices in circulation around the world. After years of investment and breakthroughs in crypto-location technology, XYO is poised to help bring the promise and the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world on a massive and global scale. This can have a profound impact on businesses that rely on the delivery of goods and services requiring non-forgeable and verifiable location data. It can power current applications like eCommerce as well as the backbone for smart cities of the future including the Internet of Things (IoT), self-driving vehicles, autonomous delivery drones, and even location tracking on the Moon and Mars.\nXYO Network\nKeri Kukral, 760-487-8421\nkeri@xyo.network\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fxyo.network&esheet=51804312&newsitemid=20180510005572&lan=en-US&anchor=xyo.network&index=3&md5=1c859ea4749dee419693cebbed5f3ca4", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fxyo.network%2F%3Futm_source%3Dinternal%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_content%3DIsmail-Malik&esheet=51804312&newsitemid=20180510005572&lan=en-US&anchor=XYO+Network&index=2&md5=620428f02b4aeaae1e25c03dc51e4086", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fxyo.network&esheet=51804312&newsitemid=20180510005572&lan=en-US&anchor=XYO+Network&index=1&md5=768f01088a9aefd9552f61d7b9402e3e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20180510005572r1&sid=mstr1&distro=nx&lang=en", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie shrem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xyo network", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "board of advisors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:14:02.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca9d08dcd11b64e0fe08f6467bd3624474a4aa2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4DH1e8d2Zj14WD5cnISVlSVQCsg6nDdeI7pNXNahIin8CQRgG4cKVQOcaogV4Q37t.9uza.VpK3oeO2h3sqdos.bXmFXApeDr9XRodfvaIQU-", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin prices will surge again this year: CoinShares chairman - Wiredfocus", "title_full": "Bitcoin prices will surge again this year: CoinShares chairman - Wiredfocus", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.wiredfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/105140172-GettyImages-887657598.1910x1000.jpg?fit=1910%2C1000&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca9d08dcd11b64e0fe08f6467bd3624474a4aa2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4DH1e8d2Zj14WD5cnISVlSVQCsg6nDdeI7pNXNahIin8CQRgG4cKVQOcaogV4Q37t.9uza.VpK3oeO2h3sqdos.bXmFXApeDr9XRodfvaIQU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin prices will surge again this year: CoinShares chairman - Wiredfocus", "text": "Bitcoin prices will surge again this year: CoinShares chairman May 17, 2018\nBitcoin will rally this year and reach its previous highs, CoinShares Chairman Danny Masters predicted.\nBut here’s what needs to happen first: Better structures and a life cycle post initial coin offerings (ICOs) — the fundraising process that helps launch new cryptocurrencies.\n“We need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build,” Master said on “ Fast Money ” Wednesday. “We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.”\n“We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle,” he continued. “A nd just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.”\nBitcoin was priced around $8,300 Wednesday evening, 5:30 p.m. ET. While the coin has recovered from lows earlier this year — briefly dropping below $6,000 in February — bitcoin is still far away from its mid-December peak around $19,500.\nCoinShares, an investment firm specializing in cryptocurrency , launched the world’s first publicly traded bitcoin and ethereum fund.\nInvestors were optimistic that Blockchain Week New York and Monday’s Consensus event would help boost the large-cap coin. But bitcoin has under-performed, down 5 percent since Monday.\nMasters pointed out that three years ago, the market and number of people interested in cryptocurrencies was very small. This week, however, more than 8,000 people showed up for Blockchain Week New York.

At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $9,375 on Bitfinex.\nAs CCN reported, mining firms have been rapidly scaling up their operations following last year’s prolonged bull market. Bitmain, the world’s dominant mining hardware manufacturer, is said to have made as much as $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, and Canaan — its largest competitor — is preparing to hold an initial public offering (IPO) that it believes will provide it with a $1 billion valuation.\nFundstrat has long been bullish on bitcoin. Founder Tom Lee has argued that, among younger investors, cryptocurrencies are rapidly replacing gold as the most popular “store of value,” and the firm has published a number of analyses that suggest the ecosystem will experience sustained long-term growth.\nThe firm has set its year-end price target at $25,000 for 2018 and has previously said that bitcoin could rise as high as $91,000 by early 2020.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.

Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is a stock market lawyer, former stand-up comedian, and a bitcoin enthusiast as the Wall Street Journal reports.\nAlicandro expects his campaign to highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin. He said he’d like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses, arguing that the Bitlicense is hurting jobs and stifling innovation. He serves as an adviser to several blockchain startups and is a small investor in bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies himself. The report adds that the AG candidate is currently checking if it is permissible for his campaign to accept donations in bitcoin .\nCanaan Seeks $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong\nCanaan Creative Co. Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, is now reportedly planning to launch an IPO in Kong Kong and raise up to a billion USD. As we previously reported , the company was also eyeing the US for a possible IPO market but has now ditched that option according to people familiar with the matter cited by the South China Morning Post .\nWarren Buffett Produces Bitcoin Mining Hardware?\nWarren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has recently attacked bitcoin by saying among other things that the cryptocurrency is “probably rat poison squared.” Therefore he would probably be very surprised to find out that he is involved with it in some way. According to reports from Canada, Climate Solutions TMI, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, has begun producing “portable cryptocurrency mines” for Montreal-headquartered data-centers firm Kelvin Emtech .\nThese “portable mines” are containers with specialized ventilation systems needed to keep 1,200 rigs cool inside a metal box. They are said to be deployable anywhere in the world in two days, each consumes 2 MW of electricity, and can generate around $1 million in cryptocurrency revenue each month. “We wanted it to be easily transported by truck, boat or train. The goal is not to move them all the time, but rather to eliminate the problem of access to electricity. We want to bring these cryptocurrency mines as close as possible to the hydroelectric plants and the remote areas where Hydro-Québec has excess electricity to sell,” explained Fooad Nejad of Kelvin Emtech. “We get to recover between 80 and 97% of the heat produced. Containers could be placed near marijuana greenhouses or community centers, for example, and provided free of charge to partners. It’s like saying, ‘I’m scratching your back, you’re scratching my back’,” he added. The company also believes that this order will create about 200 jobs in the area.\nAmana Capital Adds Cryptocurrency CFDs\nAmana Capital, a Middle Eastern financial services group, is the latest online trading brokerage to add cryptocurrency-based contracts for difference (CFDs). The company explains it took the move due to “the increased demand for cryptocurrencies.” As a first phase, Amana will offer its clients the option to trade BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP on its MetaTrader 5 platform, with additional cryptocurrencies promised to be added in the future.

Fundstrat’s Sam Doctor wrote earlier today that the price of Bitcoin could reach anywhere between $20,000 and $64,000 next year. Fundstrat Release Second Bullish Call in a Week\nSam Doctor’s prediction was explained in a note to Fundstrat’s clients. It set out the reasoning behind such a call, claiming the gains would be a product of the mining process used to verify transactions on the network and release the remaining Bitcoin of the 21 million total. The thinking is that the cost of mining a single Bitcoin has proved solid support in the past. As the difficulty of mining increases, so too will this level of strong support. According to Bloomberg , the note read:\n“Bitcoin miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees… We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.”\nEarlier this week, Fundstrat managing partner Tom Lee predicted a short term rally in the Bitcoin price. He feels that the annual Consensus conference happening next week could cause the kind of gains that would push the asset back above the $10,000 mark – potentially by a fair bit.\nThe 2018 Consensus conference is being held in Manhattan from May 14-16. It’s thought that almost 7,000 cryptocurrency proponents will be in attendance making it one of the industry’s largest.\nLee highlighted in his note to Fundstrat clients that each of the four previous Consensus events had seen the price of Bitcoin gain between 10 and 70 percent over the course of the conference. In fact, he went further than this. He stated that since Bitcoin was currently down on its opening price of the year, the rally could be even greater than those previous. This could see the digital asset hitting close to its all-time highs of just short of $20,000.\nThis week’s double bull call from Tom Lee and Sam Doctor is far from the first time that Fundstrat have been optimistic about the price of Bitcoin. Lee has previously said that a long-term target of $100,000 is conceivable. He has also stated that by the end of 2018, one of the 21 million total BTC units will cost around $25,000. His predictions have been proved correct in the past too. The mid-2017 call of $6,000 within a year from him making it was smashed just months later – much before the parabolic bubble-like run that rounded off 2017. Featured image from Shutterstock.

(Steven Senne/Associated Press) Bitcoin has been an exceedingly volatile commodity of late, with its price plummeting from around $20,000 in mid-December to under $6,000 by early February before beginning to rebound. That could scare away some investors but — and it’s a big but — Ricky Williams is actually more excited than ever about the cryptocurrency, and it has everything to do with Uranus. Lest you think Williams is guilty of a bum steer, he explained his reasoning to CNBC on Wednesday. It has to do with astrology, in which the former running back has taken a keen interest since his retirement from the NFL in 2012. “When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” Williams told CNBC. “The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.” The 1998 Heisman Trophy winner claimed that Uranus “is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation.” For its part, Taurus “is about resources and finances.” Williams may be onto something — after all, the website cafeastrology.com says, “Uranus is forward-looking.” Put that characteristic together with a money-related zodiac sign such as Taurus, and it’s no wonder the former Saints and Dolphins player thinks this celestial convergence is “going to totally change the way we view and understand” our finances. “I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things,” Williams said. Astrology can’t make you rich, but it can make you better at being yourself which could make your life more fulfilling and that often includes less money issues. — Ricky Williams (@Rickthelaureate) May 9, 2018 To his credit, Williams is not simply talking about Bitcoin’s potential; he has put his money where his mouth is by investing $50,000 in it. “I had to get a little piece of that action,” he said, before adding, “I didn’t want to go crazy.” Williams hasn’t just been dabbling in astrology, either, he’s teaching classes in it and, for $300 , will even give people 90-minute readings based on their natal charts. Of course, apart from his football career, he’s best known for a long-standing interest in marijuana, and he recently launched his own line of “salves, tonics and vape cartridges” that “harness the positive effects of herbs like cannabis in a more conscious and controlled way.” So even if the Bitcoin investment doesn’t work out, Williams has other potential sources of revenue. He told CNBC that he wasn’t overly concerned about the sharp ups and downs of the cryptocurrency, pointing to what lay behind his reasoning. “Especially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning,” Williams said. “But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.” Read more from The Post: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cafeastrology.com/uranus.html", "http://rickywilliams.life/astrology/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html", "http://rw.life/why-rw/", "https://twitter.com/Rickthelaureate/status/994347805920526336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.mysticjourneyyoga.com/teachers/ricky-williams"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ricky wil", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ricky williams", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "des bieler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven senne/associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "des bieler", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T03:26:49.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9759403db341f4ed36bb084ebe9b2f31daa0583d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3xo81AVNE0k2ymemcWXBHRHyB39STiE8G94mGshl.58X", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Sweet sweet bitcoin ! : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Sweet sweet bitcoin ! : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.redditmedia.com/hBs4KPzAYUdnM3GgORMe12srTwGIxpEP5tTXPOihYT0.jpg?w=320&amp;s=f34ee4eeed1cfde64c3519e98d8a8e3e", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9759403db341f4ed36bb084ebe9b2f31daa0583d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3xo81AVNE0k2ymemcWXBHRHyB39STiE8G94mGshl.58X", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sweet sweet bitcoin ! : Bitcoin", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\nEven in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable - amounting to about 7 per cent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just four years old, has more “deposits” than 98 per cent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the US. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently.\nThe Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves US customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Mr Casares - a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin - has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who is not keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nRead more:\nAre we witnessing the slow death of cryptocurrencies?\nIMF's Lagarde: Policymakers should view crypto assets positively\nA crypto asset backed by diamonds launches in Dubai\n'It was fun but I would never do it again’: UAE Bitcoin investors confess\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key - the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the internet is both convenient and perilous: hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nXapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognised custodial and security functions would be key,” said Mr Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorised. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nMr Casares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelising of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Mr Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he had spoken to Mr Casares.\nXapo’s advisers now include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup chief executive John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\n__", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alvaro sanmarti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T07:45:42.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46678e3c21d08e5e67b5f0002675507d24e14a2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpILZSe7QjGBhuCrofHC5qrkV0XFSSdHVNc_dPoSD9uJXaroLew9zvYVc27r1mRzE.FN0aHGB8SWMSEYVxvxxaxLOX6fUGDdj1BbUhdbq0t6NkC95HeLU5l", "site_full": "tribetica.com", "site": "tribetica.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Broke Key Barrier – tribetica.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Broke Key Barrier – tribetica.com", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.141, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46678e3c21d08e5e67b5f0002675507d24e14a2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpILZSe7QjGBhuCrofHC5qrkV0XFSSdHVNc_dPoSD9uJXaroLew9zvYVc27r1mRzE.FN0aHGB8SWMSEYVxvxxaxLOX6fUGDdj1BbUhdbq0t6NkC95HeLU5l", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Broke Key Barrier – tribetica.com", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price formed a support base around $9,000 and jumped higher against the US Dollar. There was a break above a crucial declining channel with resistance at $9,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently struggling to settle above $9,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs above $9,200 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD has to settle above the 100 hourly SMA to climb above $9,500 in the near term. Bitcoin Price Trend\nAfter a downside correction, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest near the $9,000 level against the US Dollar. The price formed a low at $8,969 and started an upside move. It climbed higher and cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,959 high to $8,969 low. It opened the doors for more upsides and the price broke a couple of key hurdles near $9,180 and $9,200.\nMore importantly, there was a break above a crucial declining channel with resistance at $9,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair tested the next major resistance at $9,450 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like buyers struggled to break the $9,450 resistance since it is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,959 high to $8,969 low. It is currently consolidating gains near the $9,350 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Once there is a successful close above 100 SMA and $9,450, the price may resume its uptrend.\nLooking at the chart , there are many positive signs above the $9,200 support. As long as the price is stable and holds the bullish bias above $9,200, it is likely to break $9,450. The next stop for buyers could be $9,600 and $9,750.\nLooking at the technical indicators :\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $9,200 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:28:00.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee8601f9c043d1192d024da92eafbaa8dc9a8e8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54DH2xsJt4kTCgbBXl3broDLiybnMwjIoyHmHZt.xtqdxoGsjD0sUO5GppvvEsmMYWp2Dtz1lE8CveSa7jyrYvRc-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ricky Williams Invested In Bitcoin Because 'Uranus Is About to Enter Taurus' - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Ricky Williams Invested In Bitcoin Because 'Uranus Is About to Enter Taurus' - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.975, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pix-taurus-astrology-horoscope-639127_1920.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee8601f9c043d1192d024da92eafbaa8dc9a8e8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54DH2xsJt4kTCgbBXl3broDLiybnMwjIoyHmHZt.xtqdxoGsjD0sUO5GppvvEsmMYWp2Dtz1lE8CveSa7jyrYvRc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adam James", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ricky Williams Invested In Bitcoin Because 'Uranus Is About to Enter Taurus' - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "\nLooking for a reason to invest in Bitcoin?

Cloudbet described this as “the biggest single win we’ve ever seen.” On October 26, 2017 – A Cloudbet casino player took home 160 BTC last week, in a new landmark for bitcoin-gaming. With the value of the currency breaking the $9k barrier, this converts to a truly life-changing win. Bitcoin owners have already been on the receiving end of some major wins this year, with the USD value of the currency growing by over 800% in the last 12 months alone Many of those already gambling and winning on the currency have been quick to embrace bitcoin- gaming due to its higher limits and faster cash-outs than many fiat operators.

Sarah Jenn | May 10, 2018 | 3:30 am\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price bounced off the bottom of its rising channel and looks ready for a move back to the top. The Fibonacci extension tool shows the next upside targets from here. However, technical indicators are suggesting that the selloff could still resume.\nBitcoin price found support at $9,000 once more and could set its sights higher, but technicals still reflect bearish pressure.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is crossing below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is still likely to resume. In addition, the 100 SMA appears to be holding as dynamic resistance for the time being.\nRSI is on the move up but seems ready to turn lower to indicate a return in selling momentum. Stochastic is heading south from the overbought zone, so bitcoin price might follow suit. A break below the $9,000 level could be enough to sustain a reversal from here. BTC/USD 1-hour Chart by TradingView\nBut if bulls stay in control, bitcoin price could pull up to the next resistance at the 38.2% extension or the 50% level at the mid-channel area of interest at $9600. The 61.8% extension is located near $9700 then the 76.4% extension lines up with the swing high. The full extension is at $10,174 just past the channel top.\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price seems to be resilient against the factors weighing on it these days, as investors are likely putting more focus on the earlier positive developments. It has been reported that ICE will be launching a bitcoin exchange, which could draw more liquidity and activity even for other altcoins.\nFor now, though riskier assets like bitcoin are being weighed down by risk aversion stemming from geopolitical risk. Recall that Trump announced that the US would pull out of the Iran deal, which could keep geopolitical tensions heightened for the time being. This scenario is usually more bullish for the dollar and other safe-haven assets.

There is a lot of speculation in the space, there is a lot of talk and hype and not enough real things getting built that touch people’s lives.”\nThe initiative, he said, was borne out of a desire to incentivize developers to build alternatives to major social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.\nIn the wake of incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he said, “We knew it was the right time for a lot of these social networks to gain traction.”\nThe company has specifically suggested that developers pursue features like uncensorable microblogs and community-curated blocklists among others. Likewise, it proposed that developers could create dapps targeted toward illness support groups, journalists and activists under authoritarian regimes, and LGBT communities, for example.\nHowever, Shea said Blockstack doesn’t intend for these ideas to “confine people,” but instead hopes they will provide a point of departure for further exploration.\nAdditionally, he suggested that the funding will act as a stepping stone for developer teams, helping them to subsist until they are able to raise venture capital.\nThe grants will be only one source of financing for developer teams. They will also have the option to build monetization into their dapps via a rewards system that is embedded in the Blockstack protocol.\n“Every single application that’s built on Blockstack will be eligible for these rewards and they will be eligible proportional to their ratings,” Shea explained.\nHe added that Blockstack’s support for social network dapps will be ongoing, noting:\n“We really want to empower those teams.”\nSocial network concept image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nTrading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\n© Bloomberg Vaulting Value At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nRead more: ‘Cryptolandia’ blockchain pioneers take root in hipster Brooklyn\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\n‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nRead more: Tracking the Crypto Bulls and Bears\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\n‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Heroic Southwest pilot describes fatal flight Pilot Tammie Jo Shults appeared in her first interview since safely landing Southwest Airlines Flight 1380.

cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, there is a new wave of bearish pressure forming across all currencies as we speak. The Bitcoin Cash price is still up by over 6.5% compared to 24 hours ago, though. With its value surpassing $1,650 once again, the race to $2,000 is still in full effect. What Comes Next for the Bitcoin Cash Price?\nAs is always the case in the world of cryptocurrencies, it is impossible to make accurate long-term predictions. For the Bitcoin Cash price , many people assumed the interest in this altcoin to calm down weeks after its release. This popular altcoin surprised the entire world by surging to a value of nearly $4,000 in the months after. Fast forward to today, and the Bitcoin Cash price hovers near the $1,650 mark. A far cry from the all-time high, yet there is plenty of excitement among community members.\nOver the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin Cash price has risen by 6.56%. It is not the biggest gain for this particular cryptocurrency to date, but given the bearish pressure affecting other markets, it’s a solid development regardless. This latest increase temporarily pushes the Bitcoin Cash price to $1.660 and more, but it remains to be seen if BCH can escape the looming bearish cycle.\nAs one would come to expect from such strong gains, Bitcoin Cash reclaimed some lost momentum over Bitcoin. Thanks to a 5.14% increase in the BCH/BTC ratio, things look rather promising for the altcoin. Although Bitcoin Cash isn’t even close to breaking the 0.2 BC mark again, the uptrend remains in place for several weeks now. Slowly but surely, this market seems to be hitting its stride once again.\nAlthough the BCH trading volume is not too impressive, it’s far from terrible. Thanks to $1.131bn in 24-hour volume, the demand for BCH is certainly there. If the bulls cna remain in control of the market today, things will undoubtedly get very interesting. It is too early to tell if that can indeed happen, though, as altcoins usually don’t escape the bearish vortex that plows through Bitcoin.\nNo one will be surprised to learn OKEx is the leading exchange for Bitcoin Cash trading volume. The platform has carved out a lead over Upbit, and Bithumb completes the top three. We see Bitfinex in fourth place, and OKex’s BCH/BTC pair in fifth place. Three fiat currency pairs in the top five for Bitcoin Cash can have a positive impact on the price moving forward, but anything can happen in the world of cryptocurrency.\nFor the time being, it seems as if the Bitcoin Cash price can remain above $1,650 for the remainder of today. It will heavily depend on how the Bitcoin price evolves, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has already lost some of its earlier gains in the past two hours. Even so, the overall long-term Bitcoin Cash price trend remains positive, regardless of what happens later today.

Novogratz Supports DOJ’s Bitcoin Manipulation Probe It is important to understand that the U.S. Department of Justice decided to open an investigation that will analyse whether crypto traders have been manipulating the price of Bitcoin or not. Something that could look like a bearish information for some enthusiasts, for some experts it is a good thing. This is what Mike Novogratz, Cameron Winklevoss, and Thomas Lee believe. During an interview with Bloomberg, Mr. Novogratz, founder of the crypto bank Galaxy Digital, explained: “Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market. Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.” During the last year, several virtual currencies have been marked as manipulated after being pumped & and dumped in different periods of time. There are hundreds of pump & dump groups that modify the normal market trend of some low-volume cryptocurrencies. As the virtual currency market is highly unregulated, these situations may continue to happen in the future in various exchanges if regulations are not implemented. Cameron Winklevoss and Thomas Lee Agree With Novogratz There are other figures in the cryptocurrency world that have also supported Mike Novogratz’s comments about DOJ’s decision to investigate virtual currencies. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said that these regulations are welcomed by the market if they help deter bad actors. Most of the cryptocurrency-related companies are searching for regulations that would bring legitimacy to the market. A field without regulation and with an important number of scams may not be able to prosper and grow. Investors will not have the necessary confidence to place their money in the game. And this is certainly not what cryptocurrency believers want. In a similar way, Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in an email to Bloomberg that these regulations are welcome news because they mean that there is ‘adult supervision coming/here.’ Tom Lee has predicted that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 dollars by the end of the year, even when the most important currency lost 25% of its price since the first week of May. Additionally, he explained that after the Consensus conference the price of Bitcoin should increase – something that did not happen until now. At the moment of writing this article, Bitcoin (BTC) is being traded over $7,500 dollars and has registered an increase in the last 24 hours of 0.67%, according to CoinMarketCap. Other virtual currencies like Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC), are operating positively as well. The virtual currency market needs regulations that will allow it to properly grow. It is important to have a framework that would let innovation to flourish but protecting investors from scammers and illicit activities. Institutional investors are slowly entering the market, and as soon as there will be more friendly regulations, the results will be even better.

ICE has had discussions with a number of financial organizations regarding a working model for bitcoin trading using “swaps” that would make way for banks to let their customers possess bitcoin the next day. A swap contract-based working tool is also said to bring bitcoin trading under the purview and the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which would be an unplanned way to regulate the bitcoin-based trading.\nJust last month, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also shared her interest in establishing a virtual currency exchange if the regulatory issues are resolved.\nCryptocurrencies have been linked with the anonymous and decentralized financial space, and the mainstream have, by and large, kept its distance from it. The unpredictability of their value, lack of lucidity about the business basics and value process, and the discreet use for potential unlawful activities such as gambling and drug dealing are the primary reasons that many people and businesses have been skeptical of it.\nAlthough bitcoin was made with an aim to act as a free, decentralized and borderless means of payment, it has instead transformed into a mode for speculative investment that is essentially beating its original purpose.\nSo far, only hedge funds have been dealing in bitcoins, and major investment channels, such as mutual funds and pension funds, have kept away from cryptocurrencies. Well-known and highly-respected investors such as Warren Buffett have not been bashful in their criticism of cryptocurrencies as an investment product.\nTheir acceptance by major Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs and the development of a dedicated trading platform by ICE may be just the boost that cryptocurrencies are looking for.

Privacy Policy or\nWASHINGTON -- Here are the drawbacks with digital currencies: Hackers and scammers can make them vanish. If an owner has a poor memory, the bitcoins can get locked for eternity in an electronic wallet, like a fly in amber.\nSome high-profile people have admitted this year to losing cryptocurrency, among them Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak.\nIn another case last month, a cryptocurrency promoter doing a livestream on his YouTube channel was notified by a viewer that digital currency was flowing out of the host's virtual account. The host later acknowledged he suffered losses of \"over $2 million.\"\nIn the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe, whether on their own devices or lodged in accounts at exchanges around the globe.\n\"I suspect many small investors may assume that their money is as safe as it would be in an online bank. But that's not necessarily the case,\" said Graham Cluley, a British security blogger and researcher.\nBitcoins first emerged in 2009, spawning the creation of dozens of other digital currencies that exist only in electronic form. They operate independently of central banks and have fluctuated wildly in value. A single bitcoin traded for around $9,130 Thursday afternoon.\nCryptocurrency exchanges, where buyers and sellers gather to trade digital currencies, are like honeypots for hackers. In the largest known heist to date, hackers in late January made off with around $530 million in cryptocurrency from a Tokyo-based exchange, Coincheck.\n\"South Korea said they thought it could be North Korea (behind the heist) but I haven't seen any other evidence of that, and it has the hallmarks of the typical cyber hack by thieves,\" said Yaya J. Fanusie, a former economic and counterterrorism analyst at the CIA who is now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national security think tank in Washington.\nAn Italian-based platform, BitGrail, reported that hackers made off with more than $170 million of a cryptocurrency known as Nano in February.\nThe loss experienced by Wozniak stung, even though he is a multimillionaire. ...continued", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "graham cluley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wild west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:33:22.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f83ed9e095029452be40a6f38454a09c64d386de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXQpNEcF2OkRwHAjvDa2OubDMi_kB9Ql6AgzB7WQo0X9W1wNHcT8RydR05j7tVWf1XwMOW8ByPsynDqE_hru9X_ivppvhlFfTByAo.Ff2nM..PRUVYyw1ldYsVjVynRus-", "site_full": "www.globalcapital.com", "site": "globalcapital.com", "site_section": "http://www.globalcapital.com/asia/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "GlobalCapital | Asia", "title": "Canaan rides bitcoin boom with $1.5bn Hong Kong IPO", "title_full": "Canaan rides bitcoin boom with $1.5bn Hong Kong IPO", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://globalcapital.euromoneycdn.com/v-3785ffab4fd4d4305a3c787e7dc269fe/Media/images/euroweek/derivatives-pictures-2/Bitcoin%203%20Adobe%20Stock%20cryptocurrency.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f83ed9e095029452be40a6f38454a09c64d386de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXQpNEcF2OkRwHAjvDa2OubDMi_kB9Ql6AgzB7WQo0X9W1wNHcT8RydR05j7tVWf1XwMOW8ByPsynDqE_hru9X_ivppvhlFfTByAo.Ff2nM..PRUVYyw1ldYsVjVynRus-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Canaan rides bitcoin boom with $1.5bn Hong Kong IPO", "text": "Equity - IPOs Canaan rides bitcoin boom with $1.5bn Hong Kong IPO Canaan is eyeing a $1.5bn IPO in Hong Kong that will test investor appetite for the first listing of a cryptocurrency firm in the city.

This marks another subsequent drop since the currency rose to $9,800 over the weekend.\nAt press time, analysts are relatively mixed regarding where they think bitcoin is heading. North Island Chairman Glenn Hutchins, for example, believes that the top spot in the crypto arena – currently held by bitcoin – may be grabbed by another digital asset in the future.\n“What we should be talking about is something called the bitcoin protocol, which is the technology we’ll use to enable the internet to move value around the world at the speed of light the way we do everything else today,” he commented. “The bitcoin currency they are all talking about is an input on that process, but it is not the end. They are all focused on that because they think about it from a trading perspective, and that’s the object that looks like it trades.”\nHutchins further compared bitcoin to a type of metal, and said that adhering to bitcoin was the equivalent of choosing “copper rather than gold.”\n“I think it is more like copper,” he stated. “Like industrial metals used to drive an outcome. Bitcoin could turn out to be Betamax to another currency’s VHS and, in other words, you could have something like XRP or Ethereum or Litecoin that becomes the token that is used… The token of exchange at the heart of the math solution that leads the technology will be there – different tokens will be used for different applications.”\nDespite the negative hype, many remain bullish about the coin’s future, particularly the research staff at Fundstrat led by analyst and crypto-investor Tom Lee (no stranger to our price articles). Recently, the team released a report discussing newfound growth in the bitcoin mining arena. Processing power is consistently referred to as “hash power,” and the team suggests that this will grow by 350 percent through 2019. In turn, this could hike the price up big time.\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by the end of 2019, with a $20,000 – $64,000 range,” explains Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat.\nAs we’ve mentioned, bitcoin has undergone a series of small, yet noticeable drops in the past week. Doctor believes they may not stop right away, though this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. He says that as the price continues to fall, bitcoin miners are more likely to hang onto their stashes to breakeven for operating costs, then sell as the price gets higher. This will lead to larger profits and jumps in the currency’s price.\n“The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,” Doctor added.\nBitcoin mining has attracted a huge following over the last two years, with Chinese ASIC developer Bitmain garnering over $4 billion in revenue in 2017 alone.\n“The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC prices appreciate,” Doctor explained.

Bitcoin and Ethereum\nSince bitcoin’s failed test of the $10,000 support level and the scheduled SEC hearing on Ethereum on May 7 did not occur, both bitcoin and Ethereum have struggled to record gains against the US dollar. Most tokens such as Ziliqa (ZIL) and 0x (ZRX) outperformed both cryptocurrencies, demonstrating gains of over 20 percent.\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve released a report which noted that the launch of bitcoin futures has had a negative impact on the bitcoin price, and that bitcoin has not been able to sustain its momentum since CME and CBOE introduced bitcoin futures to the US market.\n“The peak bitcoin price coincided with with the day bitcoin futures started trading on the CME… we argue these price dynamics are consistent with the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s,” said the Federal Reserve of San Francisco.\nAnalysts have argued that bitcoin futures have allowed institutional investors and retail traders to manipulate the bitcoin market by shorting the cryptocurrency and selling massive amounts of bitcoin contracts to cash out their short contracts.\nAs such, the cryptocurrency community did not necessarily react well to the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to the cryptocurrency market, until reports revealed that the parent company of NYSE has been preparing a proper bitcoin exchange, not a futures market.\nOver the past three days, the bitcoin price has recovered from $9,000 to $9,300, and is continuing to increase in value. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin is 55, which signifies that the dominant cryptocurrency is in a neutral zone and is neither overbought or oversold. But, both exponential and simple moving averages show a negative short-term trend for bitcoin, which may allow the bitcoin price to remain in the $9,300 region.\nStill, analysts including Wall Street’s Fundstrat founder Tom Lee expressed his optimism towards bitcoin in the short-term given that many institutional investors and retail traders will be motivated to invest in the cryptocurrency market after the biggest cryptocurrency conference launches.\n“Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” said Lee. Tokens\nZiliqa has seen a 25-fold increase in its value since its initial coin offering (ICO) in December and its recent 20 percent increase in price led the market valuation of ZIL to reach $1.4 billion. Other tokens such as VeChain (VEN) and ZRX have also recorded large gains against bitcoin and the US dollar, making up for their losses throughout the first quarter of 2018, a period during which tokens fell significantly more than major cryptocurrencies.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Meanwhile, its crypto exchange reported a first-quarter loss after the country’s financial regulator ordered it to improve.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Over 900 BTC Mined So Far\nJapanese conglomerate GMO Internet released its cryptocurrency mining business report for April this week.\n“We are currently mining bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH),” GMO wrote. The company mined 373 BTC and 0 BCH in April. In March, it mined 295 BTC and 12 BCH and in February 124 BTC and 287 BCH. Overall, GMO has mined 906 BTC and 537 BCH so far since it began operation.\nThe group revealed that its “Hash rate rose due to the increase in the number of computers we are operating as planned.” In April, the hashrate was 241 PH/s, up from 129 PH/s in March, 108 PH/s in February, and 27 PH/s in January. The announcement details:\nHash rate is an important indicator for estimating our mining share. Our goal is to see the hashrate reach 3,000PH/s this year.\nThe company announced the launch of its mining business in September last year. In October, it outlined plans to launch an initial coin offering (ICO) for the sale of its “next-generation mining boards.” In January, GMO announced that it had succeeded in developing a 12nm ASIC mining chip. GMO Coin’s Earnings Performance\nGMO Coin is the cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary of GMO Internet. It is one of the 16 fully licensed crypto exchanges in Japan. The company has launched a service to allow customers to lend their bitcoins to the company as well as set up a bitcoin salary payment system to pay its employees in the digital currency.\nHowever, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has issued the exchange a business improvement order. The only other government-approved exchange to have received such an order is Tech Bureau which operates Zaif exchange.\nGMO Financial Holdings recently released GMO Coin’s earnings report which shows an operating loss of 760 million yen (~US$7 million) in the first quarter of this year. The cost of operating the crypto business rose by about 560 million yen (~$5.1 million) for the group from the previous quarter.\nWhat do you think of GMO’s mining operations and exchange?

Nhưng đó là một tình huống đôi bên cùng có lợi trong trận chiến thương mại này, nhà đầu tư đại tài Warren Buffett nói.\nVietBF © sưu tập\n troopy R8 Võ Lâm Chí Tôn Release: 1 Day Ago\nReputation: 5031\nProfile: Join Date: Oct 2014 Posts: 19,494 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://intermati.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=1215795&stc=1&d=1525854752"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:28:47.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac1617bf8620924ab4c09c4dfe2219e861ac736d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPlVc2_PnWmeXWgq0qoP.cfLruu15b0A.7FwpyUv.91e_Lqr4aZz1ohKlKxBS3.bXP7.VmbPgUq060-", "site_full": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Diamond, Huobi Token, Skycoin | Alternative Coins Moving Higher", "title_full": "Bitcoin Diamond, Huobi Token, Skycoin | Alternative Coins Moving Higher", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.843, "main_image": "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/Bitcoin-Diamond-BCD.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac1617bf8620924ab4c09c4dfe2219e861ac736d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPlVc2_PnWmeXWgq0qoP.cfLruu15b0A.7FwpyUv.91e_Lqr4aZz1ohKlKxBS3.bXP7.VmbPgUq060-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Caroline Harris", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Diamond, Huobi Token, Skycoin | Alternative Coins Moving Higher", "text": "Ad Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY): To Infinity and Beyond\nAlternative coins are killing it on the crypto markets today. Specifically, Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY). Meanwhile, the more well-known altcoins, such as Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) are all down.\nWe’re going to focus on the three alternative coins and token today — Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY). Bitcoin Diamond (BCD)\nBitcoin Diamond (BCD) is currently selling for $5.51. This puts BCD up 14.71% in the past twenty-four hours. Not bad, right? BCD has a market capitalization of $846.81 million. Source: CoinMarketCap\nSo far, Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) has had a successful month of May. The latest announcement from the Bitcoin Diamond team came on Monday. At the start of the week, Bitcoin Diamond announced that it will be listing on the SWFT blockchain platform. If you don’t know, SWFT is a cross-blockchain platform.

Further, last week, Bitcoin Diamond provided development and operation progress for the month of April. It cited support from exchanges, like OKcoinkr.com and KEX.kr, and support from the media. For instance, both Reuters and Nasdaq have reported on the alternative coin. Additionally, on May 1, it was announced that Coinw listed Bitcoin Diamond (BCD). $BCD just listed on Coinw exchange!

Source: CoinMarketCap\nDespite being a newbie to the crypto markets, Huobi Token (HT) has managed to develop the reputation of being a coin that offers solid volatility. Over the past two months, Huobi Token (HT) has made waves, even when the crypto market was faced with a crash. In April, Huobi Token (HT) collected roughly 83% of gains during the last 30 days.\nSo, what’s happened in May so far? Is there a reason Huobi Token (HT) is up nearly 15% in the past twenty-four hours? Huobi doesn’t appear to have announced anything today, but that doesn’t mean the markets aren’t optimistic about the value of this token. In fact, one report stated that because Huobi didn’t go through an initial coin offering, and its structure makes sure investors are keen to have the token no matter what, Huobi Token’s (HT) value has a chance of increasing.\nWhat do you think? Skycoin (SKY)\nSkycoin (SKY) is currently selling for $26.38. This puts Skycoin (SKY) up 10.83% in the past twenty-four hours. Source: CoinMarketCap\nSkycoin has been pretty quiet since early April. On April 12, it was announced that Skycoin (SKY) is now trading on CHAOEX. However, word surfaced this week that Skycoin (SKY) will be added to five “upcoming high volume exchanges” soon. Skycoin has not said anything about this, so keep your eyes peeled to see if this really is happening.

There haven’t been any big updates to any of the major blockchain projects. Months ago, the market’s volatility ran high as various countries began implementing various regulations to try and control cryptocurrency. Lately, however, the governments have remained fairly quiet since the latest G20 summit and the market has remained somewhat ‘consistent’ in response. At press time, the entire market cap is sitting just over $435 billion.\nLet’s take a look at the coins that are leading the market this morning!\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\nToday’s BCH run-up is in response to the upgrade that its network will go through in five days. In 8 days, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will undergo a scheduled upgrade. This upgrade increases block size limit to 32MB, and re-enables old OP codes to bring scripting and smart-contract functionality back to Bitcoin. https://t.co/ONZ1IFXYDV pic.twitter.com/vkiQx0xTpV\n— Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 7, 2018\nCurrently, Bitcoin Cash remains as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\nAt press time, BCH is trading at $1,651.05 a coin, up 5.24 %, in 24 hours. For the week, BCH is up 10.8 % and for the month, the coin is up 159 %.\nDASH\nThe DASH team has been fairly quiet as of late, as the coin currently sits as the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Earlier today, DASH’s latest partnership was announced and it gives DASH holders access to use their digital tokens at 36 million merchants worldwide.\nDASH has just teamed up with Paycent, the subsidiary app of the texcent ecosystem. This app allows its users to now store crypto and use crypto. Both users and merchants can convert DASH to fiat instantly.\nThe COO of Paycent, Nitlin Gupta, commented on the partnership by saying:\n“One of the reservations the average day person has with utilizing cryptocurrencies is transaction settlement times. No other digital asset can compete with Dash’s InstantSend transaction speed. Dash allows merchants the ability to receive payments instantly from customer , making Dash one of the first entries into real-life consumer payments making it no different as if you were to swipe a credit or debit card.”\nThe Paycent app is available on both the Android and Apple stores.\nAt press time, DASH is trading for $453.35 a coin, up 3.10 %, in 24 hours.\nVeChain (VEN)\nJust this morning Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange, announced that VEN deposits have been enabled on their platform. Deposits have been enabled for VeChain (VEN). https://t.co/1Mue8weNEG pic.twitter.com/rf94MEipxJ\n— Bitfinex (@bitfinex) May 10, 2018\nIt remains unknown when trading will begin on the Bitfinex platform, but following the announcement, the coin jumped up in price in a fairly dominant red market.\nAt press time, VEN is trading at $5.35 a coin, up 6.56 %. For the week, VEN is up 1.1 %, but for the month, VEN is up 102.65 %.

Recently I sat down with my good friend, Louis, from Smaulgld.com, to talk about a great many things. Among the topics we covered were: Silver! How we got into this price funk, and what can break us out of it! How India has made the silver rigging a dangerous game, and how much their stacking has increased again lately(Hint: ALOT !)… The key, technical price level that silver stackers should be watching keenly, before getting excited about a breakout… Why Stackers & HODL’ers should be UNITED in the fight against our globalist enemies…and why it’s the best way we can break free from the banksters… The soul-searching question every stacker must ask themselves(the answer is different for everyone)… Why I love both precious metals AND cryptos, and why no one has to choose one or the other … Why I finally decided to gain exposure to cryptos along with my silver(and why I’ve never regretted it)…\nAll this, and much more, is covered by Louis and I in this podcast. I encourage you to take a listen.\nThe best way forward for all enemies of the globalists, is to remember that these banking monsters are the enemies of us all. We need each other in this struggle, and we must help each other take these financial demons down….by any means we can.\nWelcome to the fight!

The index, designed to track the performance of the largest, most liquid coins, consists of 10 cryptocurrencies at its inception.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space New Crypto Index Michael Novogratz.\nGalaxy Digital Capital Management and Bloomberg announced on Wednesday the launch of a cryptocurrency benchmark index called Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP is an asset management firm dedicated to the digital currency and blockchain sectors founded by Michael Novogratz, a former Principal and Chief Investment Officer of the Fortress Macro Funds and a former Partner at Goldman Sachs.\nCiting that “the BGCI offers the first institutional grade benchmark for the cryptocurrency market,” the announcement details:\nThe index is designed to track the performance of the largest, most liquid portion of the cryptocurrency market. The BGCI is market capitalization-weighted and measures the performance of ten USD-traded cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, monero, ripple, and zcash.\n“The index constituents are diversified across different categories of digital assets, including stores of value, mediums of exchange, smart contract protocols, and privacy assets,” the companies explained. “The index is owned and administered by Bloomberg Index Services Limited and is co-branded with Galaxy Digital Capital Management.” About the Index\nAt its inception, the BGCI contains 30% bitcoin and ether, 14.13% ripple, 10.63% bitcoin cash, 6.11% EOS, 3.77% litecoin, 1.67% dash, 1.66% monero, and 1% ethereum classic and zcash.\nNovogratz set out to launch a crypto hedge fund originally but he halted this plan in December and unveiled Galaxy Digital instead.\nHe said on Markets Now that “we are hoping that this index becomes the bellwether and benchmark for the whole crypto space that hedge funds are compared to it… and that is seen as a watershed moment where crypto starts to become an indigestible asset class from an institutional perspective.” He also asserted:\nThe Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index brings unprecedented transparency to the crypto markets.\n“It’s almost essential for every investor to have at least 1% to 2% of their portfolio” in crypto, he emphasized.\nIn November last year, Novogratz said on CNBC’s Fast Money that “Bitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018.

A great majority of the ICOs today are ‘ERC-20 tokens’ created by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with no more than a few hundred lines of code. Unfortunately, there’s a big misconception that a bunch of nerdy geniuses created these blockchain-based tokens, and today we’re going to show you just how easy it is to create an ERC-20 token — In less than thirty minutes.\nAlso read: Introducing the ‘Do Nothing Technologies’ Blockchain-Based ICO Posternut (PNT): The ERC-20 Token Created in Less Than 30 Minutes\nToday we decided to create a contract using the programming language Solidity, in order to create a custom token using the Ethereum network. We want to demonstrate just how easy it is for anyone with very little coding knowledge to launch a coin. There are lots of ICOs out there in the crypto-space and a great majority of them are ERC-20s derived from the public Ethereum blockchain. Essentially an ERC-20 token is a contract written in Solidity that sets the parameters of the coins attributes, like where the tokens are stored, the token’s name, ticker symbol, supply, and more. We used this code here found in the walkthrough written by Moritz Neto and the code was developed by an Ethereum developer called ‘BokkyPooBah.’ The Necessary Requirements\nFinding out how to create a token only takes a minute with a quick Google search on the subject. We followed a short walkthrough written by Moritz Neto, and watched a quick video filmed by the Youtuber Ivan on Tech. Both instructions detailed the creation of an ERC-20 token that can be done in less than 20 minutes, and we created a token called ‘Posternut (PTN) in 25 minutes. In light of our first time creating a Solidity contract, we used ETH testnet tokens on the Ropsten Network so no real funds were lost. Using a text editor to modify the copied Solidity code is helpful as you can find the lines of code that need to be updated more easily. The max supply, token name, address output, and token symbol are just some of the things you can change within the code.\nNext, we decided to download the Metamask Chrome extension Ether wallet, a fairly smooth platform but still in beta. Other wallets can be used to create a token contract as well, like Mist and the My Ethereum Wallet (MEW) platform. You are also going to need some testnet ETH for the ‘gas’ (network fee) to create the contract on the Ropsten Network, and there are a bunch of Ropsten faucets that dispense testnet ETH. We stocked up on some coins and then found a contract which we got in Moritz Neto’s guide, but there are all types of solidity contracts that can be re-written. Basically, we left this page open in the browser to copy and paste the Solidity contract, and all that is needed next is some slight modifications. Using Remix to set the parameters of the code, double check it and deploy on the Ethereum Ropsten Network. This entire process can also be done on the ETH mainnet with real funds.\nThen we went to a website called remix.ethereum.org which is used to launch the contract. This process can also be processed on the aforementioned wallets above as well, but we used the Remix Solidity IDE platform. After copying a token contract you need to paste the code into the Remix platform and edit a few parameters. This is when you want to choose the tokens name, the token’s symbol, the max supply, and the Ethereum address to deposit the tokens. After all of that is chosen and changed within the copy and pasted code, the next option is to ‘run’ the codebase you edited. If there are any warnings that are ‘critical’ the Remix platform will tell you something is wrong. In the ‘run’ section choose ‘Injected Web (Ropsten)’ and the name of your contract. Deploying the contract and confirming it using Remix and Metamask. After this step simply wait for an error or wait for the transaction to confirm and when it does your token will be complete.\nFrom here the Metamask address is also tethered to our account and we simply pressed deploy. If something is wrong with the contract then it will display warnings in yellow or red and you may need to fix these issues before deploying the code to the Ropsten Network. After pressing ‘deploy,’ the transaction will be sent across the network. As soon as the transaction confirms the contract should be complete as long as there were no errors. After Posternut (PTN) token was created we then sent the newly minted coins to another Metamask wallet address. Things Needed to Deploy a Token Contract on the ETH Network in Thirty Minutes: An Ethereum wallet. (Mist, MEW, Metamask) Testnet Ethereum or real ETH can be used for gas. A platform to deploy the contract either on testnet (Ropsten, Rinkby) or mainnet. (Remix, MEW, Mist) The Simplicity of Launching an ICO\nThe name of our token is called ‘Posternut (PNT)’ and there are 100Mn tokens now in existence on the Ropsten network. Creating the token took only 25 minutes and the same thing can be done on the main Ethereum network with less than $20 USD worth of real mainnet ETH for gas. Most of the time-consuming parts of the process is basically studying the directions on how to create an ERC-20 token, and following each step. After creating the Posternut tokens we decided to send the 100Mn PTN to another address which was sent with no issues. The Posternut (PTN) token was created on May 10, 2018, on the Ethereum Ropsten Network by Jamie Redman.\nAs we stated above, it doesn’t take a genius to build an ERC-20 contract and now that you have seen the different Solidity contracts that make this process work, you can also see if an ICO project used this same method. Simply look at the contract code to see if it resembles something copied from another project, as you’d be surprised to find quite a bit of them. After creating the Posternut tokens there are only a few other things needed to launch an ICO. Observers will find that all a team needs to push a project, is a website, and a white paper. We all know that these ICOs raise a lot of money as token sales have raised over $5.6Bn in 2017 alone, and continue to raise funds this year. If all it takes is a website, 25 minutes of coding, and a white paper this may be why over 46 percent of ICOs fail . Before Investing in Token Sales, Do Yourself a Favor and Research These Projects\nSo before investing in an ICO do some research on the project and make sure it is not some ‘fly by night’ guy who coded a coin in less than thirty minutes. The fact is just because a person(s) can build an ERC-20 token doesn’t mean the project is worthy, and investors should diligently research ICO teams and the tokens they are selling. Otherwise, you could be purchasing a quickly made coin, and buying into a word salad white paper written to make you believe Posternut (PTN) tokens are the future of decentralization.\nWhat do you think about launching an ERC-20 in less than thirty minutes?

He will be responsible for conducting business operations, facilitating local and international brand awareness, creating educational content on behalf of Paxful, recruiting and overseeing the incubator’s day-to-day operations. Speaking about the new hub, Paxful CEO, Ray Youssef, stated:\n“Paxful is committed to fostering economic growth in Africa and helping the unbanked and underbanked gain access to the opportunities they have been denied for so long. The incubator is simply a starting point to help driven entrepreneurs in an industry that has shattered boundaries all over the world.”\nChimezie then commented:\n“It is a privilege to work with an organization that believes in investing in countries with great potential such as Nigeria. Paxful’s initiatives have not only helped those in great need here, but are also helping African entrepreneurs achieve their full potential. Paxful is using Bitcoin to do good in the world, and I am proud to become an integral part of that.” Founded in 2015, Paxful’s mission is to give customers a simple, fair, and secure platform for trading. It has built a global peer-to-peer payment logistics platform and describes itself as an online wallet and universal translator for money.

We do not yet have a license to offer intermediate services, but we are not operating illegally. The company is closely following any new regulations about Bitcoin, and is willing to comply with any new law,” said Phuong.\nAccording to the company’s website, the company was founded in 2013 and is certified to enable transactions involving Bitcoin .\nBut, in a recent interview, a representative disclosed that the company’s license was only to be used for “financial advisory” purposes.\nThe company has created a number of websites over the past four years, including bitcoin.vn and vbtc.vn. Bitcoin Vietnam first made an announcement that its main domain, bitcoin.vn, suspended for a temporarily by VNNIC on March 6.\n“VNNIC shall suspend operation of the domain name bitcoin.vn to be handled by the functional agencies according to the provisions of law. The suspension period is 45 days, from 15:00 on 05/03/2018”, said the company’s statement.\nBitcoin Vietnam Co was given 10 days to put into application the sanctioning measures, which the cryptocurrency exchange already followed. The domain is down and the exchange now operates using the Bitcoinvn.io domain.\nThe State Bank of Vietnam does not recognize the legal status of virtual currencies as legal payment methods, and transactions or use of digital currencies are not protected by law.

Bitcoin Beats Gold\nIn the battle between Bitcoin and gold, the former certainly comes out the winner in a variety of categories.\nAs noted by Forbes , gold doesn’t function well as currency, is insecure, experiences price volatility not too far removed from digital assets, and cannot easily be digitized. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steadily moving towards mainstream adoption as a viable currency, is highly secure, and allows for cross-border transfers of value in a matter of hours at most. Furthermore, mining real gold uses a tremendous amount of energy and has an environmental impact vastly more significant than Bitcoin mining .\nHowever, there’s one category in which Bitcoin trounces gold that has largely gone overlooked — it’s become the dominant form of flight capital. What Is Flight Capital?\nFlight capital, generally speaking, is money transferred abroad to either avoid taxes and/or inflation or provide for possible emigration — particularly in times of war.\nTo put it simply, if the brown stuff hits the fan and you’ve got to pack up and move, it’s a lot easier to take your Bitcoin with you than it is to lug around a bag of gold. As noted by Clem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide :\nWhen Little Rocket Man was wrestling Big Rocket Man, gold didn’t react, but Bitcoin went off the dial every night. You can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nOf course, nobody wants a war — but should one happen, cryptocurrency investors and early adopters will be the ones set to remain most secure in their wealth. Concludes Chambers:\nNow Etherium, Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and a myriad of crypto will get the attention that gold once enjoyed.\nIts bad news for grumpy old men but good news for crypto-believers and a new trading opportunity for us.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the new form of flight capital? Do you think conflict and war only increase the demand for digital currencies and assets? Let us know in the comments below!\nImages courtesy of Bitcoinist archives and Shutterstock.

Perhaps we should record the purchase on this tool when breaking down the level of $720. In this case, for new purchases waiting for developments and new signals. If the price will continue within the framework of the General directions for last month, refill buy Ethereum is after the price strengthens above $760.

With just days left there are a few things BCH holders and full node operators should know before the upgrade takes place this coming Tuesday.\nAlso read: Japan’s GMO Has Mined Over 900 Bitcoins – Hashrate Doubled Last Month Just a Few Days Left Until the May 15th Bitcoin Cash Upgrade\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is about to perform the largest block size increase ever as the upgrade will expand the block size by 4X on May 15, 2018. The development team has also added ‘Satoshi OP_Codes,’ and the fork will also increase the protocol’s default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes. Unless you run a BCH full node implementation there is not much a common user needs to do, except refrain from transacting during the upgrade. The Hard Fork Activation Will Use the Median Time Past Method\nThe BCH fork on May 15 will be similar to the fork activations that took place on August 1, and the DAA fork that took place this past November. This means the activation will take place on May 15, but there won’t be specific block height, because the upgrade will activate based on ‘Median Time Past’ (MTP). The initiation of the hard fork will begin on Tuesday, May 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade will not be implemented until the MTP timestamp and the processing of 11 blocks equal to or greater than 1,526,400,000 takes place. Following this period after the next block, the 32MB upgrade will be live on the BCH network. Full Node Clients and Miners Must Update Software\nFull node operators need to upgrade their Bitcoin Cash clients as soon as possible, before the fork begins. ABC users can download the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version here , and those operating other full nodes like Bitcoin Unlimited, or XT should upgrade to the client that supports the 32MB increase. At the moment looking at data for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a great majority of nodes have already upgraded to the latest 0.17.1 ABC version. Full node operators and miners are required to upgrade their software in order to participate during and after the network change. Ordinary Users Should Refrain from Transacting With BCH During the Upgrade and Patiently Wait for the Fork to Complete It is best not to transact with BCH during the May 15th Bitcoin Cash upgrade.\nOrdinary users don’t have to do much of anything, except keep up to date with current events concerning the fork, and its best not to transact during the activation period as well. This means if you don’t have to send money on May 15, then wait until the fork is complete before transacting with BCH. It’s always a good measure to look out for any updates provided by your exchange or wallet provider to make sure the platform you use is ready to accept the network changes. If your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s probably safe to assume that the exchange or wallet provider is ready for the upgrade. So on May 15 if your money is on an exchange or held within a non-custodial wallet all you really have to do is patiently wait until the fork is finished. Last November’s Successful Hard Fork Shows There Shouldn’t be Any Complications\nThe May 15th Bitcoin Cash fork that will change the protocol’s base block size to 32 MB, while adding some other interesting features will be quite a milestone for the BCH community. The last fork that took place this November was successful , and the new Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has worked flawlessly ever since. The 32MB increase will be much larger than the already sizable 8MB blocks, and the upgrade will likely be a historic day for public blockchain consensus upgrades.\nWhat do you think about the fork taking place on May 15 that will increase the base block size to 32 MB?

Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP and Bloomberg will establish the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). The index service will provide trusted asset tracking for 10 of the most liquid cryptocurrencies in the market. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index\nThe BGCI is part of the Bloomberg Index Services Limited catalog and is administered by the company. The platform offers institutional-grade benchmarking standards for cryptocurrencies.\nSpeaking on the launch, Alan Campbell, the Bloomberg Indices Global Product Manager, said:\nToday’s launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index reflects our clients’ growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market. How the Index Works\nThe BGCI will monitor and track the performance of the ten largest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap. The index operates via a rules-based methodology. To ensure accuracy, all data used by the index must pass the due-diligence framework set by both Bloomberg and Galaxy Digital.\nNot all cryptocurrencies are the same. As a result, the BGCI’s cryptocurrency tracking pool covers the different classes of digital coins. These classes are privacy assets, mediums of exchange, stores of value, and smart contract tokens. The ten cryptos contained in the BGCI paradigm at its launch are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple , Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Zcash.\nThe maximum and minimum cap for any coin on the index is 30 percent and 1 percent respectively. At inception, both Bitcoin and Ethereum make up 30 percent of the BGCI while Zcash is at one percent. Commenting on the way the BCGI is structured, Steve Kurz, Asset Management Chief at Galaxy Digital, said:\nWe are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index’s independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature. The BGCI will Become the S&P 500 for Cryptos\nMike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism at the new BGCI. He described the index as another milestone in the march towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. He also said the platform adopts the rigorous approach utilized by mainstream benchmarking services to the crypto market.\nCommenting on the potential importance of the BGCI, Novogratz said:\nWe wanted an institutional player for the whole ecosystem, and I think it’s important for the crypto ecosystem. You’re starting to see more institutional participation, and what they’re looking for is this architecture — here’s an index that will feel like the S&P 500 in a few months, that people can benchmark themselves against.\nBloomberg and Galaxy Digital aren’t the first to launch a crypto benchmarking platform. Upbit, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, recently created a cryptocurrency index service.\nDo you think the BGCI will become the de facto crypto benchmarking service for mainstream investors?

The company is eyeing traders and bankers from Wall Street, including from its CEO’s former employer, Goldman Sachs, according to Bloomberg. With over 2 million users on its platform, the number of Bitflyer employees “has doubled to more than 150 people in the past six months and is on pace to top 300 before year-end,” the news outlet detailed.\n“At Bitflyer, we are actively recruiting talent in many occupations,” the company tweeted this week.

A slight recovery has been made from the profit taking and markets have climbed back over $430 billion. Bitcoin bears could not push the daddy of crypto below $9k and it has risen 3% on the day to $9,350. As a result most of the altcoins are trading in the green on Asian markets this morning. One shooting for the moon today is the same coin we featured yesterday, Zilliqa.\nBoosted by a listing on OKEx yesterday, ZIL has continued its pump for the second day. According to Coinmarketcap it has surged 31% over the past 24 hours. Currently trading at $0.21 this altcoin has jumped from $0.15 this time yesterday. Weekly gains have been even more impressive rising 75% from $0.12 this time last Thursday. On the month ZIL has surged an astounding 450% from $0.038 this time last month. Gains against Bitcoin have been solid with 30% on the day to 2290 satoshis from 1700 sats this time yesterday and over the week ZIL has made 74% on BTC rising from 1320 satoshis last Thursday.\nThe surge in Zilliqa price has been driven by listings on another two major exchanges. This time it is South Korean Bithumb that has made ZIL available to its customers; Zilliqa(ZIL) and Ethos(ETHOS) will be listed on Bithumb and Bithumb PRO.

Kelly is Shocked\nEarlier this week, as CCN reported , NYSE’s parent company ICE Exchange has been developing and testing a bitcoin exchange to serve investors from the traditional finance sector. Various reports revealed that ICE Exchange is not launching a futures market like CME and CBOE, rather a proper bitcoin exchange on which investors can buy, sell, and store bitcoin directly.\n“The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential,” the New York Times reported.\nKelly emphasized that while he is “shocked” the cryptocurrency market did not surge in value based on the entrance of NYSE into the market, he stated that investors have missed out on an important element, which is that like Xapo and Coinbase, NYSE and its parent company ICE Exchange will start to operate a custody solution for institutional holders. The operator of the NYSE is planning to support bitcoin trading.\n“I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bearer instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly.\nHe further noted that the development of a bitcoin custody solution by ICE Exchange signifies cryptocurrencies have become an emerging asset class. More importantly, Kelly added that the growth of cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class will allow multi-billion dollar pensions, endowment, and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\n“Finally, it opens the door for pensions and endowments. Up to this point, it has been very difficult for them to get comfortable compliance wise in holding cryptocurrency. If ICE has a custodian solution that is SEC compliant, that’s going to open the floodgates,” Kelly added. What Will Floodgates Look Like?\nThe cryptocurrency market has become a $0.5 trillion market with barely any capital from institutional investors, endowments, and pensions. If institutional investors begin to enter the cryptocurrency market with tens of billions of dollars in new capital, it will allow the cryptocurrency market to grow at a pace that is incomparable to its growth rate in the past. It could enable the cryptocurrency market to evolve into a multi-trillion dollar market, as many investors have expected since 2016.\nImages from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ice exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T23:09:43.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09a165d72d0df1ed38f76deb17be30eab1e37402", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8AOZVaKq4ugomDbShbkzzcBOVCmqDtNThtK7V6zWllJio.kPKDnZyD7TUodEg0rLxHmBQ6hzFPujWFl9bvgr2Zt2NIIiQvIwThfAKm9pA8Sg--", "site_full": "www.muchdogenews.com", "site": "muchdogenews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Mt.

The tax agency demands in those letters that the recipients will divulge all of their involvement in the cryptocurrency market including all past transaction history and current holdings. People are being asked to list all exchange accounts and wallets they ever had and report their trade earnings. Additionally, the agency demands that people will reveal if they are engaged in mining.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General Check Your Mailbox\nThe agency appears to be be very confident in its suspicions as some local tax offices have not even bothered with sending out the letters with demands for information, instead they just opened a business case for anyone they think is trading bitcoin. Those people are simply informed they must pay income taxes as business owners now, fill reports retroactively back from 2013 as well as keep balanced books and report taxes on salaries to employees as any other business, as if they were restaurant or factory owners.\nEarlier this year the tax agency issued a circular on the matter, declaring that bitcoin is an asset, and thus anyone trading it must pay the capital gains tax of 25% and anyone considered to be running a business must also pay the VAT of 17%. The Tax Authority commented to Israel’s Globes newspaper: “Following the publication of the circular, which reflects the Authority’s position on the taxation method of trading and investing in virtual currencies, the Authority is working to locate those active in the field who do not manage a case in the tax authorities. We recommend that those who conduct unregistered activity in these areas take advantage of the existing channels to settle their issues before they will have to endure the unpleasantness that accompanies enforcement. ” Monitoring Social Media Groups\nThe Tax Authority is not exposing how it got its hands on a list of bitcoin traders in the country to check if they report or not, but there a few obvious ways. The banking system in Israel is very hostile to any bitcoin dealings, and the banks thus probably proactively report all inbound and outbound transactions involving known accounts of exchanges abroad as possible money laundering and tax evasion. And the few local trading avenues available to Israelis can easily be compelled to hand over a list of their clients with a warrant.\nInvestigators have used more creative means, however, people familiar with the tax scene told the Globes newspaper. They claim that undercover agents are monitoring local groups for peer to peer buying and selling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Facebook, Telegram and Whatsapp. The information gathered there is said to be sophisticatedly cross-referenced with other available data.\nWhat should Israeli bitcoin do with this information?

Canaan Seeks a Billion Through IPO in Hong Kong\nThe South China Morning Post has reported that Canaan, a giant in the Bitcoin mining industry, has made plans to launch a 1 billion dollar IPO in Hong Kong according to unnamed sources close to the deal. If the IPO is successful it would make Canaan the first company from the blockchain industry to be listed on the Hong Kong bourse.\nThe rumors that Canaan Creative have been considering launching an IPO outside of China started in April, with most considering the US and Hong Kong as top candidates. Now the unnamed sources say the company has settled on Hong Kong and will be looking to reach the billion-dollar mark.\nThe Hanzou based company was founded in 2013 to design and sell the high-performance circuits specific to mining Bitcoin. In 2017 Canaan released unaudited figures that showed a net income of 410 Million Yuan ($64 million) which was a 600 percent increase over 2016 profits.\nCanaan has previously made two attempts at raising funds through IPO’s in China. First in 2016 when the company tried to gain a listing in China’s A-share market by partnering with electric equipment maker Luyitong but the plan ended when regulators judged the deal to be overvalued. They failed again in 2017 when they applied for a listing in China’s “New Third Board” market which requires less stringent requirements for undisclosed reasons.\nAmid China’s crackdown on crypto trading and ICOs the majority of Canaan’s clients are still in the country which remains one of the top three Bitcoin mining nations. The company’s decision to launch an IPO out of the country may be linked to its future plans of creating home appliances that also passively mine cryptocurrency and its desired expansion to create chips for mining alt currencies. Mining Conglomerates Could Choke Ethereum\nCanaan seeking to raise a billion dollars in order to expand its already massive mining interest leads to concerns over the decentralization of cryptocurrency mining as Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain begins a shift towards mining Ether to increase profits.\nEthereum’s increase in popularity and price has attracted mining conglomerates to either change over from mining Bitcoin or add new hardware in order to mine its native token the Ether. Bitmain which builds and operates mining rigs that are much more powerful than the average GPU miner may endanger the decentralized nature of the network.\nThe dominance of mining conglomerates can push GPU miners out of the space leaving the network to be reliant on a few giant companies. Lucas Nuzzi an analyst at Digital Asset Research called this scenario a “nightmare for decentralization,”.\nImage from Shutterstock Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giant Chooses Hong Kong Over US for IPO was last modified: May 10th, 2018 by John McMahon ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcmahon", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ipo chinese bitcoin mining giant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "south china morning post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:32:41.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d77eb74637103452851ffe8aa537749581c0f12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6G4chokBXJt2DcAy07UQSx7GuBhr29iFKMMabzVkM72ea6AGC8XQ6SX4n4jvryl3gCUJe5ZnSaiOGr2D1UYyXW0r4DqxzM9HBcmqCwDAbmAiWzDsiqYR_", "site_full": "www.enterprisetimes.co.uk", "site": "enterprisetimes.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Emercoin delivers graduate certificate blockchain | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Emercoin delivers graduate certificate blockchain | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/friend-2727307.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d77eb74637103452851ffe8aa537749581c0f12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6G4chokBXJt2DcAy07UQSx7GuBhr29iFKMMabzVkM72ea6AGC8XQ6SX4n4jvryl3gCUJe5ZnSaiOGr2D1UYyXW0r4DqxzM9HBcmqCwDAbmAiWzDsiqYR_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Emercoin delivers graduate certificate blockchain | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Emercoin delivers graduate certificate blockchain May 10, 2018 | Enterprise Times | Shares: 0\nEmercoin has announced it has built a pilot blockchain solution to verify graduate certificates.

May 10, 2018 4 Views Eustace Cryptus · May 10, 2018 · 10:00 am\nWe live in a world where people only validate what they personally believe to be true irrespective of the facts. Therefore, it’s fair to ask whether Bitcoin’s repeated failure to surpass the 200-day moving average is indicative of underlying weakness, or is confirmation bias fueling investors’ dreams of Bitcoin price above $10,000? Market Overview\nThe third time has not been the charm for bitcoin as it bounced off the 200-day MA after an exciting run up to $9,990. While a pullback from the $10,000 resistance was expected, the drop below $9,000 was a bit harsher than expected.\nA quick glance at the top 10 cryptocurrencies shows a handful recovering from 10 to 15% drops and BTC has recovered some ground to sit slightly above the $9,200 support. While the pullback from $9,990 is indicative of bullish exhaustion, general market sentiment remains positive as the cryptocurrency market capitalization steadily creeps towards $500 billion.\nMost investors appear unconcerned within the current correction and the majority of FUD seems to be wafting from a trio of cantankerous fuddy duddies who compare bitcoin trading with cow pats, casinos, rat poison , and ‘ harvested baby brains ’.\nAll FUD aside, encouraging developments that are likely to accelerate BTC momentum are occurring. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently announced that it intends to offer BTC swap contracts that will be settled in BTC rather than fiat.\nGoldman Sachs confirmed plans to open a cryptocurrency trading desk within weeks and Mike Novogratz has decided to have another go at opening a crypto trading index. Next week New York will host the world’s largest cryptocurrency conference (Consensus) and Fundstrat research analyst Tom Lee predicts BTC is in for a ‘massive ’ rally due to the excitement surrounding this momentous event. Highlights\nBTC was predominately bullish for most of last week as the cryptocurrency passed through multiple resistance levels only to run out of steam at $9,990. April’s rally brought back memories of the late 2017 cryptocurrency euphoria but hopes have been continuously dashed each time BTC failed to cross the 200-Day MA. The on May 9th Bitcoin price sunk to a weekly low below $9,000 as bears broke the support at $9,200 and continued their work on the $9,000 support.\nAs seen on the daily chart, BTC toppled out of the ascending trend line and set lower lows and lower highs, indicating short term weakness as the bears attempt to take charge. Daily Chart\nSince yesterday BTC has been working to recover lost ground, retaking the $9,200 support but struggling to reach $9,400. Various iterations of the simple moving averages highlight the dissolution of bullish bias and at the time of writing the RSI is turning down from 50 and the MACD is currently below bearish territory.\nThe 5 and 10-day MA have reversed course and appear to be closing the distance between each other but a turnaround won’t begin until BTC trades above the 50 MA. 4HR Chart\nBTC still needs to cross the 50 MA at $9,450 and previously, movement past $9,500 provided a path towards $9,700 and eventually $10,000. Gains above $9,780 would place BTC back into the ascending channel and a close above the 50 SMA ($9,450) would signal that the downtrend has finished.\nIf BTC is unable to recover, there is strong support at $8800 and $8350. It’s possible that BTC could trade in this range before the rally to $10,500 – $11,200 continues. Next Test for Bitcoin Price\nMomentum should improve when $9,500 is passed but the 200-day MA remains a major resistance. The next tests for BTC should be at $10,500, $11,250 and $11,750 levels of resistance.\nIf the downtrend continues and BTC closes below $9,000, a drop to $8,800 and below could take place. Bearing this in mind, aggressive traders should take caution and initiate 50% positions whereas longs could add to their positions.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\n\"> Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nTrading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\n© Bloomberg Vaulting Value At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nRead more: ‘Cryptolandia’ blockchain pioneers take root in hipster Brooklyn\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\n‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nRead more: Tracking the Crypto Bulls and Bears\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\n‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Take a break from Google: The apps you need Google is all but impossible to avoid--it's also a huge collector of personal data.

Although it remains unsuccessful in crossing the key resistance level, there is optimism that that cryptocurrency market will bounce back shortly.\nBrian Kelly is one such optimist. He has discarded Warren Buffett’s and Bill Gates criticisms of late, stating that he believes the cryptocurrency market to be immune to billionaires bashing. Source Image: coinmarketcap.com\nBitcoin price trades around the $9,400 level today, while altcoins are also paring losses from earlier in the week. Is the upside movement attributed to Brian Kelly’s rebuke of the legendary investor’s thoughts? It could very well be. Brian Kelly Responds to Buffett’s and Gate’s Criticism\nBrian Kelly – who predicts bitcoin price to hit $250K in the next couple of years, rejects Buffett and Gates criticism. He said Warren Buffett was proved wrong so many times in the past — pointing out in particular his criticism towards commodities and tech companies.\nWarren Buffett was among the most prominent critics of high growth tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, he changed his stance later on, and now Apple is one of the biggest holdings according to the latest 13F filing.\nReplying to Bill Gates negative attitude towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, Brian Kelly compared bitcoin with Microsoft. He said , “ unlike Microsoft which provides software and which is centralized, Bitcoin is a decentralized software. Bitcoin gives the users incentive to run this open source. making the internet itself a unique economic model .” Hopes are High for the Bull Run\nCryptocurrency markets have been experiencing positive developments since regulators around the globe started accepting the emerging market. Following Goldman Sachs and NASDAQ, the reports suggest that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) – the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is planning to introduce cryptocurrency trading in the days to come. Bulls are also optimistic that the Consensus Summit will bring positive change to cryptocurrency markets, and that is just around the corner.\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos/© mdkhalil1 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kelly responds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:07:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65c8b5b9b7aa4a5a2e88a8c05a9e645e1e2c015f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8bbp1IeN7g.ihp7bItnWEU1vb6oRAco65WCh6gfc4_EN2t0OAgj0VR9OQuKC.41ejUmvwr01EVfMVugYRPEPi21jNU2n5OSo-", "site_full": "www.ethnews.com", "site": "ethnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Huawei Phones To Support Bitcoin Wallet, Starting Today - ETHNews.com", "title_full": "Huawei Phones To Support Bitcoin Wallet, Starting Today - ETHNews.com", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.ethnews.com/images/1024x512/Huawei-Phones-To-Support-Bitcoin-Wallet-Starting-Today-05-11-2018.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65c8b5b9b7aa4a5a2e88a8c05a9e645e1e2c015f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8bbp1IeN7g.ihp7bItnWEU1vb6oRAco65WCh6gfc4_EN2t0OAgj0VR9OQuKC.41ejUmvwr01EVfMVugYRPEPi21jNU2n5OSo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Phones To Support Bitcoin Wallet, Starting Today - ETHNews.com", "text": "Huawei Phones To Support Bitcoin Wallet, Starting Today By Adam Reese May 11, 2018 7:43 PM May 11, 2018 7:43 PM 0 LinkedIn Cancel The Chinese mobile phone giant Huawei will permit users of some of its devices to download a cryptocurrency wallet.\nHuawei, one of China's leading mobile phone sellers, will allow some of its users to download a bitcoin wallet beginning on May 11.\nThrough the company's own mobile application store, known as AppGallery, Huawei customers will be able to access BTC.com's bitcoin wallet, which they can use to send, receive, and store the cryptocurrency. AppGallery will be immediately available on new phones and will be deployed to older models in the coming months.\nBTC.com is run by Bitmain , one of the world's top manufacturers of hardware that is designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining. The organization behind the site also runs the largest bitcoin mining pool by hashrate, which, at press time, had mined nearly twice as many blocks as any other pool over the past 24 hours.\nThe news appears to represent a reversal of sorts because, in the past, the Chinese government has blocked access to cryptocurrency-related apps in other mobile app stores.\nIn the wake of an apparent ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, trading platforms that had been operating in the country either shut down or moved their operations offshore by the end of October 2017. The Chinese government followed up this year by blocking exchanges' channels on the popular messaging app WeChat. However, Chinese citizens are still permitted to own digital assets.\nThis latest development does not represent Huawei's first foray into the blockchain space, nor, arguably, its most significant. Last month, the firm unveiled a Blockchain-as-a-Service platform . In March, details emerged about a set of open-source software solutions that the company is pursuing, which, it asserts, will allow people to measure the performance of various blockchain platforms and evaluate certain differences between them. That same month, reports stated that the firm was looking into building a phone that would be tailor-made for running blockchain-based apps .\nUS officials have speculated that Huawei's hardware could be built to facilitate spying by Chinese government agencies. Other countries have sought to keep its products out of their borders as well, including Algeria , which more recently appears to be working with the company again.

Canaan Seeks a Billion Through IPO in Hong Kong\nThe South China Morning Post has reported that Canaan, a giant in the Bitcoin mining industry, has made plans to launch a 1 billion dollar IPO in Hong Kong according to unnamed sources close to the deal. If the IPO is successful it would make Canaan the first company from the blockchain industry to be listed on the Hong Kong bourse.\nThe rumors that Canaan Creative have been considering launching an IPO outside of China started in April, with most considering the US and Hong Kong as top candidates. Now the unnamed sources say the company has settled on Hong Kong and will be looking to reach the billion-dollar mark.\nThe Hanzou based company was founded in 2013 to design and sell the high-performance circuits specific to mining Bitcoin. In 2017 Canaan released unaudited figures that showed a net income of 410 Million Yuan ($64 million) which was a 600 percent increase over 2016 profits.\nCanaan has previously made two attempts at raising funds through IPO’s in China. First in 2016 when the company tried to gain a listing in China’s A-share market by partnering with electric equipment maker Luyitong but the plan ended when regulators judged the deal to be overvalued. They failed again in 2017 when they applied for a listing in China’s “New Third Board” market which requires less stringent requirements for undisclosed reasons.\nAmid China’s crackdown on crypto trading and ICOs the majority of Canaan’s clients are still in the country which remains one of the top three Bitcoin mining nations. The company’s decision to launch an IPO out of the country may be linked to its future plans of creating home appliances that also passively mine cryptocurrency and its desired expansion to create chips for mining alt currencies. Mining Conglomerates Could Choke Ethereum\nCanaan seeking to raise a billion dollars in order to expand its already massive mining interest leads to concerns over the decentralization of cryptocurrency mining as Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain begins a shift towards mining Ether to increase profits.\nEthereum’s increase in popularity and price has attracted mining conglomerates to either change over from mining Bitcoin or add new hardware in order to mine its native token the Ether. Bitmain which builds and operates mining rigs that are much more powerful than the average GPU miner may endanger the decentralized nature of the network.\nThe dominance of mining conglomerates can push GPU miners out of the space leaving the network to be reliant on a few giant companies. Lucas Nuzzi an analyst at Digital Asset Research called this scenario a “nightmare for decentralization,”.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency chinese bitcoin mining giant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china morning post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:36:42.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e7fc9975fd47779d85cd0a3515b51602c82d687", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLDNujwrI2r4adXWvdIXhyIJHTG3TBtfJ2SGypRtipsJ11QE92iScD1NmNa1z5N7qZrN76K0fuctmYzC4ViGS8DhqQFGcnDbJOweCDb0AKfoGfHGr5aidURg--", "site_full": "altcointoday.com", "site": "altcointoday.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban", "title_full": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://altcointoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-53174743.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e7fc9975fd47779d85cd0a3515b51602c82d687", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLDNujwrI2r4adXWvdIXhyIJHTG3TBtfJ2SGypRtipsJ11QE92iScD1NmNa1z5N7qZrN76K0fuctmYzC4ViGS8DhqQFGcnDbJOweCDb0AKfoGfHGr5aidURg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban", "text": "May 10, 2018 Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban Bank of America (BoA) doubled down on its decision to stop customers buying Bitcoin with its credit cards May 10. The bank’s official called cryptocurrency “troubling,” according to CNBC.\nSpeaking to CNBC in an edition of the network’s Squawk Box segment, BoA’s CTO Kathy Bessant said that cryptocurrencies are “designed to be not transparent” and thus hinder banks’ attempts to catch “bad guys.”\n“As a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort, in fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent,” she told the program.\nBoA caused friction with its cardholders when it instigated the Bitcoin purchasing ban in February.\nThe move saw JPMorgan and Citigroup follow suit, the former nonetheless subsequently finding itself at the center of a consumer lawsuit in April over “fraudulent” purchase fees.\nFor Bessant, however, cryptocurrencies still represent the opposite of financial transparency.\n“The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that,” she added.\n“Just like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.”\nWeeks after the initial ban, BoA produced a report conversely identifying future risks to its business, in which it highlighted its “inability to adapt” to the competition cryptocurrency poses.

The current market value of the bitcoins is more than $140 million, according to the CoinMarketCap price index, which values one bitcoin at around $8,800 . The sale of such a large amount of bitcoins could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency markets.

These 10 stocks have multibagger quality By Tom Metcalf Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune. Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold? Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady. ‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 per cent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 per cent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the US But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves US customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states. The outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares. “Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”Xapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft. The first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar. The most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense. Trading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards. “They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it. Casares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews. Yet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock. Such salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence , including touring the Swiss vault. “Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”Xapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds. ‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound. “A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said. Casares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth. That drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin. “I am personally allocating a per centage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc. ‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies. Other purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer. Xapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too. “It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.” 0 Comments ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/the-super-rich-ignore-buffett-hoard-10b-bitcoins-in-bunkers/articleshow/64107433.cms&title=The", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom metcalf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T12:11:12.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb8fe77f443c69d9d165f68cb2476c805afbc7ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tfxg1OPW080FhYj6Y_MGV7qdvhrraigseY42HQlLDmGwBsqh3pM1R.EyrS.iEJSNFJw--", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Newsflash: Bitcoin Price Takes $250 Nosedive", "title_full": "Newsflash: Bitcoin Price Takes $250 Nosedive", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bitcoin-new-decline.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb8fe77f443c69d9d165f68cb2476c805afbc7ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tfxg1OPW080FhYj6Y_MGV7qdvhrraigseY42HQlLDmGwBsqh3pM1R.EyrS.iEJSNFJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Newsflash: Bitcoin Price Takes $250 Nosedive", "text": "Newsflash: Bitcoin Price Takes $250 Nosedive\nThe bitcoin price took a $250 nosedive on Thursday, putting an end to what had previously been a day of relative stability.\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency had spent the majority of the day trading near $9,325 on Bitfinex, though it peaked as high as $9,390 during the early morning hours.

Instead, the wallet app will be available for download via Huawei’s app gallery that is pre-installed on Huawei phones.] Did Somebody Say ‘Mass Adoption?’\nBitcoin is set to continue down the path towards mainstream adoption thanks, in no small part, to mobile phone giant Huawei Technologies Co. On Friday, the third largest mobile handset maker in the world will begin affording their users the ability to download Bitcoin wallets on their devices.\nThe announcement comes from BTC.com’s vice president of business operations, Alejandro de la Torre, as the BTC.com wallet is slated to become the first cryptocurrency app offered by Huawei’s AppGallery. Explained de la Torre in a phone interview with Bloomberg :\nIt’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the wallet will be available inHuawei’s AppGallery pre-installed on all phones. Putting Bitcoin in the Palm of Everyone’s Hands\nThis move from Huawei most notably impacts the Chinese market, which doesn’t exactly have a track record of being cryptocurrency friendly.\nDespite interest from Chinese citizens, the country’s government has taken a hardline approach to the buying and selling of Bitcoin, outright banning exchanges earlier this year. However, Chinese citizens are not forbidden from owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nAs noted by Bloomberg , the government of China also blocks Android’s Google Play Store and many sections of Apple’s iTunes, which has effectively served to limit exposure to apps like BTC.com’s cryptocurrency wallet. With Huawei set to provide said wallet to almost all of its users, lack of exposure will no longer be a problem.\nOf course, it’s also worth noting that BTC.com is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies and is in control of the world’s largest mining pool for the dominant cryptocurrency.\nWhat do you think of Huawei putting Bitcoin wallets into the hands of all its users? Do you think providing convenient wallets to the Chinese population will help facilitate mainstream adoption in the crypto-strict country?
