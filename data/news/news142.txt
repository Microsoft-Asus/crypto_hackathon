Speaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: \"We are deep at work with it.\"\nTessler is quoted in Bloomberg confirming that Deutsche Boerse is “not at the same stage” as CME and that they want to make sure that they understand the underlying transaction “which isn’t the easiest thing to do.”\nTwo months ago, Deutsche Boerse announced a plan to work with the financial management firm HQLAX and R3’s Corda blockchain platform to implement a system that can offer more efficient securities settlement via a blockchain.

Over $18 million worth of Bitcoin Gold coins are missing so far.\nThe criminal has used a lot of different servers in order to have under his control more than half of the fintech company’s hashrate. To put it simply, he has managed to perform a “51% attack”.\nHaving hacked the system, he was able to change some particular details of blockchain transactions. Thus, he got everything needed for the second attack, known as “double spend”, which provided him with the opportunity to spend the same amount of virtual coins twice. Who Became a Victim of the Hack? \"The cost of mounting an ongoing attack is high. Because the cost is high, the attacker can only profit if they can quickly get something of high value from a fake deposit,\" the Bitcoin Gold team explained. \"A party like an Exchange may accept large deposits automatically, allow the user to trade into a different coin quickly, and then withdraw automatically. This is why they are targeting Exchanges.\"\nActually, the attacker has been working according to one scheme for the last several days. He has been storing BTG digital currency in very large amounts at exchanges and at the same time sending these coins to his e-currency wallet.\nIt’s interesting to notice, that so far the hacker has been stealing funds only from exchanges, but not users. Moreover, he had also managed to withdraw all the money before the exchanges realized the transaction was invalid. What Effects Could the Attack Have?\nThe Bitcoin Gold team reports that the attacks have begun approximately on Friday, May 18. Since that time, more than 388,000 trade coins have been lost in the hack, that means the hacker has gained more than $18 million.\nDespite the fact, that no user has cryptocurrency gone, such attacks pose a great danger as they may lead to the destabilization of backup funds belonging to an exchange or to its insolvency. Thus, an exchange can go bankrupt, having no ability to give the money back to users who still keep them with the company.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:51:49.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9d6d20546e28b33134170894449626a1055f761", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU2evhbMHmcqMp8_iJeWuVM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Definition for bitcoin fans and bitcoin hater", "title_full": "Definition for bitcoin fans and bitcoin hater", "published": "2018-05-25T17:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9d6d20546e28b33134170894449626a1055f761", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU2evhbMHmcqMp8_iJeWuVM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pikaqiu", "published": "2018-05-25T17:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Definition for bitcoin fans and bitcoin hater", "text": "Those who have confidence in Bitcoin who profit from Bitcoin, or who expect to profit from Bitcoin, are Bitcoin fans.

He still fully expects that the Bitcoin price will reach $25,000 by the end of the year.\nCrypto Market Unexpectedly Slips, Falls By Over 7% Tom Lee, known as a \"chronic\" bull in the cryptocurrency community, reiterated his belief that Bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of the year. He has long been the face of the industry as he regularly appears on CNBC segments regarding this growing market, showing up on a weekly basis.\nHis recent announcement during the CNBC Futures Now segment came after a 1% decrease in the price of Bitcoin.\nHowever, not even 24 hours after Tom's Futures Now appearance, Bitcoin dropped by over five percent to under $7,600. This negative price action has wiped out the majority of price gains seen pre-Consensus.\nHowever, Bitcoin did not fall as much as altcoins and actually gained market dominance, moving from 37% to 38%.\nThis has been a common theme as altcoin investors tend to jump ship when waters turn murky for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, has further proven itself to be a store of value and a so-called \"shelter in the storm\" in this emerging market.\nBattered but Positive, Tom Lee Stands by Price Prediction While Lee was quick to call this surprising drop \"typical crypto volatility\" in an email sent to CNBC, during his appearance on Futures Now , he recognized three aspects which have assured his bullish price predictions.\nThe first aspect that he mentioned was the cost of the creation of Bitcoin, or in more simple terms, mining. He highlighted the fact that the electricity, equipment, and other assorted costs of mining a Bitcoin is approximately $8,000.\nHowever, after yesterday's drop, he noted that the cost of mining a Bitcoin had dropped to $6,000. Taking into account that the current price of Bitcoin versus the newly lowered cost of mining one, many still see Bitcoin as an undervalued asset.\nHe also noted that he expects an even higher level of institutional involvement to arrive later this year, saying:\nI think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty.\nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Lee still expressed his positive attitude, stating:\nBut that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies.\nWhen looking at market statistics, it is clear to see why he still holds positive sentiment despite the over 60% price decrease in Bitcoin since its December highs. In the past 5 months, venture capitalist firms have poured over $1.3 billion dollars into cryptocurrency startups.\nTake the example of the heavily publicized announcement of Goldman Sachs' entry into the cryptocurrency industry. The announcement made earlier this year saw the Sachs-backed Circle purchase the Poloniex crypto exchange, with the end result of Circle reaching a valuation of $3 billion.\nOn the surface, a three billion dollar company in a $350 billion industry may seem irrelevant. However, this is just one of the major examples which show that institutional investors and companies are willing to get invested in this industry.\nIf Tom Lee's expectations become reality, there will be a countless number of investments made in this industry.\nFinally, to put a cherry on the Bitcoin's metaphorical top, Tom recognized statistics put together by his market analysis firm, Fundstrat, stating:\nHistorically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin's price.\nIf history is any indication, that means a run for Bitcoin will happen fast, possibly skyrocketing within a matter of a few days or weeks.\nTom Lee put it best saying:\nSo as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.\nWhat do you think of Tom Lee's expectations and analysis? Do you think he is too hopeful, has just the right amount, or is he actually underestimating the price of cryptocurrencies in the future?

Shortly before the Friday start of US trading, the market bounced off yesterday's lows and is trading at $7400.\nEarlier the price fell below $7250, on the background of increased sales. After three consecutive red trading sessions, the Bitcoin price dropped from 7900 to 7250 dollars, eventually stabilizing at the level of 7300 dollars.\nIt is obvious that the cryptocurrency market is in the short-term bearish cycle. In a very volatile bear market environment, positive market and near-market events often do not affect the market and are simply ignored. Although the positive news has not been in the crypto market for a long time. The only factors that matters for bear market are - in addition to the constant desire to sell - the technical factors and overboughtness factors.\nAlthough now bulls have everything necessary to intercept the initiative and stop the market at current levels, if the pressure of the bears continues, the next level of support will be the $6580 zone.\nIt is interesting enough that during its short history over the past 12 months, Bitcoin recorded three large-scale declines. All three downward movements were stopped at the same level of support in the region of 6600-6000 US dollars. Bitcoin fell from $20000 to $ 6000, but then again recovered to $12000.\nA similar trend occurred when the price rose from $6400 to $11000. It is possible that the price will again fall to the region of $6000-$6400 dollars and will immediately indicate a strong rally to up the region of 11000 dollars - 12000 dollars.

(Family Guy/Fox) Share Nick Saponaro Co-founder, the Divi Project May 25, 2018\nThink you know cryptocurrency? You’re probably wrong. Many people assume crypto will seamlessly replace financial institutions, eradicating big banks’ seemingly constant misconduct. Others believe crypto will be a surefire money-making solution, only to come out broke, devastated, and purporting that “cryptocurrency is a scam” for no reason other than their misunderstanding of the market.\nI used to wonder where these gross misconceptions were coming from. Who was spewing out these lies about crypto either being our savior or our tormentor?\nThen I turned on the TV.\nIt’s an inspiring reflection of socioeconomic progress that cryptocurrency is infiltrating pop culture. But each time a show propagates misinformation relating to the basics of the crypto industry, this progress is tarnished. After all, the average viewer doesn’t know better: In an age where Facebook is a trusted source of news and information, our trust spills over into other media forms, like TV programs. People aren’t exactly fact-checking their favorite characters’ quips, so it’s easy to mistake the misinformation they deliver to be the truth.\nSo let’s do it right now. Here are some examples of the common crypto misconceptions that pop culture is propagating. Myth #1: Bitcoin is a get-rich-quick financial solution\nReality: Bitcoin, along with all cryptocurrency, is an educated gamble at best. There’s no guarantee of a return on your investment, and if you don’t do your research, you can lose your money very quickly.\nIn other words, don’t be like Peter Griffin on Family Guy , who suggests bitcoin as a solution to his family’s financial trouble. Their problem is that they don’t know how to save, and exchanging their fiat cash for digital money is not going to change that. (Being like Peter is also generally just a bad idea.) Myth #2: You can lose your digital money the same way you can lose your digital files\nReality: The beauty of cryptocurrency is that it exists on a blockchain. This means that when you buy coins, your purchase is recorded on a distributed ledger, which is a network of computers that keeps track of each coin’s ownership. So if you buy bitcoin using your laptop, for example, and you lose that laptop, your money will still be safe because the blockchain has your back. You can easily access your coins from another device.\nThis may surprise you if you saw the Big Bang Theory episode devoted entirely to searching for a laptop, which ostensibly held bitcoin that Sheldon and his friends purchased seven years earlier. Ultimately, they discover that the coins were downloaded onto a USB that is long gone, therefore insinuating that their bitcoin is long gone, as well. No matter how smart you may think Sheldon is, please do not trust him here. The blockchain, in reality, would have had Sheldon’s back, just as it has yours. Myth #3: Bitcoin is easy and convenient to send, spend, and receive, just as fiat currency is\nReality: Bitcoin is a store of value. While originally intended to operate as a currency, it’s now widely accepted by crypto users to be more like gold. (This is a reality specific to bitcoin, however, and does not speak for the larger potential of cryptocurrency.) The reason bitcoin is unlikely to ever be used in the place of fiat payments is its slow transaction time and overall systemic complexity.\nLeslie Knope’s befuddlement is therefore understandable in Parks and Recreation , when a web developer tells her to “PayPal [him] some bitcoins” for compensation. Aside from the impossibility of PayPal’s current platform transacting bitcoin, cryptocurrency transactions aren’t instantaneous… yet. They are massively secure, but they aren’t quick. Myth #4: Criminals can easily hack into, steal, and transfer your digital money\nReality: A fundamental part of cryptocurrency is the safety it grants individuals through high-tech security protocols. Your money is secured in a digital wallet, which is secured by a private key, which is secured on a ledger device, which is protected by multiple passwords. Someone would need all of this to access your coins.\nIt would be impossible to have any idea of this safety, however, from the Billions episode where Axe “ gives his trading partner ” a ledger containing a million dollars in crypto. Aside from the fact that digital currency isn’t stored on a ledger—only private keys are—the trader doesn’t have what he needs in order to access the funds Axe is promising. * * *\nInstead, here is the unglamorous truth not meant for the silver screen: Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are incredibly complex; it’s challenging even for insiders to navigate the terrain because it changes almost daily . However, one guarantee we can make is that neither will be going away. Cryptocurrency is an opportunity for wealth to transcend borders globally and open new monetary opportunities for those who need them the most.\nIt’s worth it to educate yourself on crypto, even if you build just a basic understanding. But really educate yourself, and don’t simply absorb what’s portrayed on TV. There are a lot of great resources out there, many of which aim to strike a common ground between jargonized language and layman’s terms.\nHow, and to what extent, you choose to embrace crypto is up to you. But whatever you do, keep in mind that fundamental research is key.\nThis article is part of Quartz Ideas , our home for bold arguments and big thinkers.

The pressure on Bitcoin has been mounting in the past year as various state and international regulators have increased their scrutiny of how Bitcoin is traded.\nNow the Department of Justice is investigating whether the price of Bitcoin is being manipulated. SPOILER: It’s being manipulated :\nThe Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices — such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\n…\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight. 3 shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?url=https://www.spartareport.com/2018/05/doj-opens-a-major-criminal-probe-into-bitcoin/&title=DOJ+Opens+a+Major+Criminal+Probe+Into+Bitcoin", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13358Z:US"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "doomberg flip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:20:55.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9611c3d70ac34c8f440e5ac60bdea83e6cd5bfa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFiWk4Swyfb5t4FgV29De_jsg7zC1L3oepYU5r1_JPBGHKP8ONfSh30Y62Ue3C37hdq3MZhr1L1D.PlOwh6Lv8", "site_full": "www.tradingview.com", "site": "tradingview.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Bullish Bitcoin / USD Indicators and dates", "title_full": "Bullish Bitcoin / USD Indicators and dates", "published": "2018-05-25T16:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5101, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9611c3d70ac34c8f440e5ac60bdea83e6cd5bfa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFiWk4Swyfb5t4FgV29De_jsg7zC1L3oepYU5r1_JPBGHKP8ONfSh30Y62Ue3C37hdq3MZhr1L1D.PlOwh6Lv8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T16:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bullish Bitcoin / USD Indicators and dates", "text": "Wow the inversion looks a bull run that is out of steam and forming h and s...

With all the noise about bitcoin, are businesses missing the message about blockchain’s bigger benefits?\nBlockchains link pieces of electronic information together across a vast global network of unconnected parties. They’re distributed ledgers – shared agreements about reality – which create associations between pieces of information and a visible, distributed consensus.\nIn other words, they create an irrefutable, defensible record – of transactions, of ownership, of all kinds of information – witnessed by the whole chain. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin couldn’t function without that established authenticity, but blockchain’s potential in the business world goes far beyond financial tracking.\nHere at Price Bailey, we’re researching the immense scope of blockchain technology and we’ve identified several key areas ripe for real and lasting change. Some can already be explored by businesses today, others will take greater regulatory change, but all have the potential to advance the way businesses work – and work together. 1. Building better land registries\nWhenever people want to sell, transfer or raise funds from their property, they need a trusted source to ratify that they own it. However, according to the World Trade Organisation, 70% of the world’s population has no access to a land registry , making this an incredibly difficult task.\nThe distributed consensus at the heart of blockchain technology offers a powerful new way to establish true and trusted information about property ownership. If endorsed by the rule of law, it opens up the prospect of blockchain being used to stimulate investment in real estate worldwide – providing peace of mind to both land owners and financial institutions.\nIn turn, this would allow individuals to generate more economic activity – freeing them to use their asset as a security because financial institutions actually believe in their ownership of the property. 2. Tracking assets worldwide\nToday’s consumers are more conscious than ever of making ethical, responsible choices about the goods they buy. Blockchains can help to inform those choices, providing valuable information on everything from sustainable sourcing to lifecycle emissions.\nThey provide the ability to cost-effectively track and trace a whole range of assets, from diamonds to white goods. This can help consumers better understand the environmental and societal costs of procuring or manufacturing certain products, as well as limit fraudulent activity and substantiate efforts like the EITI (Extractive Industries and Transparency Initiative).\nA great example is the blockchain already being used to track ‘ethical cobalt’ from mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, creating shared trust and transparency around where and how resources are mined.\nBeyond ethical choices, blockchain asset tracking also opens up opportunities to track the components that go into everyday goods, improving warranty arrangements for both customers and manufacturers. 3. Improving information efficiency\nThe vast array of separate databases used by today’s organisations create an inefficient system where work is constantly duplicated, and time routinely wasted.\nFor example, in professional services, customer due diligence often holds up delivery of products and services. Checks like KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti Money Laundering) and FACTA (Foreign Account Transparency Act) all need to be performed, but at the moment every entity the customer works with makes the same checks, so they’re carried out again, and again (and again).\nBlockchains could change this. Any industry that uses lots of information – such as insurance, logistics or banking – could share access to data they trust, removing the need to duplicate things like identity verification, credit checks and transaction tracking. This could significantly reduce operating costs for organisations – while delivering a faster service for customers. 4. Creating smart contracts\nTaking this streamlined way of working a step further, blockchains could pave the way for smart contracts. These are ‘if-then’ contracts that are hard coded onto a trustworthy, anonymous blockchain, and that self-execute based on information held on the chain about an individual’s preferences.\nThese could range from simple, everyday applications such as ‘if the price of energy falls below X, then turn my smart washing machine on’, to more business-focused applications like options agreements, where triggering events like a future date or strike price can be written in.\nRather than these sorts of preferences (or data) being stored by a private entity, which could commoditise the information about you as an individual, they can be held anonymously on a variety of blockchains, all ratified by a distributed, established consensus.

So it’s no wonder tech-savvy charities are now using virtual reality headsets to parachute potential donors directly into the worlds of those they could help, whether that’s a 12-year-old Syrian refugee or a grandmother living with Alzheimer’s. ‘Virtual reality is a really innovative way for us to engage new audiences and give them a sense of what’s happening inside Aleppo,’ says Kristyan Benedict, crisis campaign manager at Amnesty International, which has been giving its street fundraisers £14 VR headsets and smartphones as part of its #360 Syria project. A threemonth trial saw 1,935 new donors sign up, worth £170,000 a year.\n‘We now have a specialist tech and human rights unit, which is using real-time satellite technology to show forced displacement of the Rohingya in Myanmar, heat maps to show where a bomb has landed even if authorities are saying nothing has happened, and using geolocation and crowdsourcing to track incidents, such as chemical weapons attacks in Sudan. This technology isn’t new — advertising and marketing companies have been using it for a long time — but from an NGO perspective it’s early days.’ Amnesty international\nWhether it’s the recent revelations about the use of prostitutes by senior Oxfam staff in Haiti, the collapse of Kids Company amid allegations of financial malpractice and sexual abuse, or the recurrent controversies over fundraising websites such as JustGiving taking a cut of public donations, trust in the charity sector is at an alltime low. In March, a survey by the not-for-profit research consultancy nfp Synergy found that only 54 per cent of people in the UK said they still trusted charities. Which is why innovative organisations are using technology to win back the support of digital natives who have little time for — or feel cynical about — charitable giving.\n‘I call it “dev-tech” and it’s especially happening in London right now,’ says Rohan Silva, co-founder of the co-working space Second Home, where a number of the charities in question are based. ‘Geneva has the big NGOs headquartered there but barely any tech, whereas San Francisco has a global technology scene without the charities. London meanwhile has the technology, it has the big charities and it also has a community of small non-profit start-ups who are able to use that technology in a really efficient way.’\nAt Second Home there is Videre, a ‘21st-century Amnesty International’, which gives human rights activists cutting-edge hidden recording devices so they can testify to abuse; and Spring, which helps technology companies empowering women in Africa and Asia, such as Safe Boda, an ‘Uber for girls’, which organises safe motorcycle taxis for young women in Uganda. ‘The big names in this sector have tended to be notoriously slow on the uptake when it comes to innovation,’ says Grant Morgan, CEO of Louis Kennedy, a corporate social responsibility marketing consultancy. Safe \"Uber\" style Motorcycles for women are launching in Uganda\n‘However,the landscape is changing. We’re currently developing a piece of technology using cryptocurrency, which will change the way we give globally — not just giving users the ability to track their donations, but to choose exactly what their money is spent on.’\n‘Blockchain is having a huge impact on the third sector,’ agrees Federico Malvezzi, project manager of AidCoin, a cryptocurrency specially designed for charities. ‘No record can be erased on the blockchain, meaning traceable accountability and zero fraud, and there’s no need for middle men or transaction fees. Plus, smart contracts could mean that if certain predetermined conditions aren’t fulfilled, donors would receive their donations back or be able to redirect them towards more deserving or pressing causes. In 2010, for example, the Red Cross raised $500 million (£370m) to provide homes for 130,000 people in Haiti. What would you have done with your donation upon realising that, five years later, only six homes had been built?’\nBoth the Red Cross and Save the Children have been trialling bitcoin donations, which have zero per cent processing fees. But some forward-thinking non-profits are going one step further and creating their own cryptocurrency. Charity: Water, founded by New York-based former nightclub promoter Scott Harrison, has developed a Clean Water Coin, which uses real-time video, GPS mapping and slick online slideshows to allow donors to follow every (virtual) penny. ‘I wanted to reinvent charity. I thought it had become broken and stigmatised,’ says Harrison, who has the support of the tech world’s glitterati, from Twitter’s Jack Dorsey to Spotify’s Daniel Ek. ‘Harrison runs Charity: Water like a great start-up,’ says Ek. ‘He’s disrupted the whole charity model.’\nBitcoin donations becoming more common\nVinay Nair is the co-founder of Lightful, a digital consultancy that helps smaller charities use social media more effectively. ‘We recently held a hackathon for Comic Relief, worked with the charity Climate Reality using chatbots to answer people’s questions and did a project for Parkinson’s UK where people affected by the disease could upload footage of their symptoms to Facebook. Today it’s about more than just rattling a tin and saying, “Please donate now” — it’s taking people on a journey and telling them a story.’\nIndeed, the days of a teddy shaking a bucket at the Tube station might be numbered — research from YouGov indicated that one in seven people fail to donate because they no longer carry cash. Charitable donations through websites, social media and apps now account for £26 in every £100 donated in the UK and a recent trial of ‘tap and go’ contactless collection boxes found that supporters making contactless payments parted with three times as much as those fumbling in their pockets for change, potentially earning charities an extra £80m a year.\nBut it’s not only money being drummed up via social media. In 2015 the charity Help Refugees used a Twitter hashtag to mobilise grassroots support, and in just a few months went from being a group of friends with no experience in the charity sector to one of the biggest providers of aid in the Calais Jungle. ‘At the start we were raising money and co-ordinating donations and volunteers entirely through Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp,’ says Philli Boyle, a director at Help Refugees. ‘We were aiming for a grand and within a week we’d raised £56,000 and were getting 7,000 donations a day. When we got to the camp we were amazed that none of the big aid agencies were helping. They said that the camp wasn’t legally recognised or it wasn’t in their three-year budget and that kind of bureaucracy was really frustrating to see.’ Poster in solidarity of refugees\nThree years later and Help Refugees — which is volunteer-run and almost entirely crowdfunded — has helped more than 722,500 people, galvanized more than 25,000 volunteers, raised over £10m and works with more than 80 projects across eight countries. ‘We’re trying to fill in the gaps that governments or large NGOs can’t,’ says Boyle. ‘It’s about common sense and taking the initiative, whether it’s setting up a refugee info bus with wi-fi in the camp or giving phones topped up with credit to unaccompanied minors.’ One of those phones led directly to 15 lives being saved, after a seven-year-old Afghan boy called Ahmed sent a text to one of the charity’s children’s workers to say he was trapped in a refrigerated airless lorry running out of oxygen. Help Refugees and local police tracked the phone and found him, along with 14 adults, all still alive, near a motorway service station in Leicestershire. ‘That was down to every person who shared our status updates, followed us on social media or donated to our fundraising pages,’ says Boyle.\nIn a 21st-century update of the aphorism, ‘give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’, Help Refugees not only gives refugees phones, but teaches them how to code. It funds Old Street-based Code Your Future, founded in October 2016 by Germán Bencci who was working at Samsung at the time. ‘I really felt like the tech industry should be doing more to help people, so when the refugee crisis happened I reached out to my contacts,’ says Bencci. Mentored by volunteers from the tech industry, 80 per cent of Code Your Future graduates get employment within a year of graduating. As they train, students work on projects for NGOs, such as developing a searchable database of the local services available to asylum seekers and refugees, from English lessons to sanitary towels. ‘When a student graduates from the course and gets a job, you feel like the trajectory of their life has been changed,’ says Bencci. ‘It certainly beats my old day job.’\nThe feel-good factor means that some of the tech scene’s brightest minds are moving beyond algorithms to make a bigger impact. Drones transporting medical aid are currently being tested in Malawi, and UK-based start-up Windhorse Aerospace is developing an edible drone which can be consumed along with its cargo. ‘We’re experimenting with a variety of food to make the body of the aircraft, such as dehydrated meat, honeycomb or pasta,’ says Nigel Gifford, founder of Windhorse, who sold his drone company, Ascenta, to Facebook for £12.5m in 2014. ‘I’ve always been attracted to the art of the impossible.

As far as fundraising techniques go, it certainly beats a chugger with a clipboard. So it’s no wonder tech-savvy charities are now using virtual reality headsets to parachute potential donors directly into the worlds of those they could help, whether that’s a 12-year-old Syrian refugee or a grandmother living with Alzheimer’s. ‘Virtual reality is a really innovative way for us to engage new audiences and give them a sense of what’s happening inside Aleppo,’ says Kristyan Benedict, crisis campaign manager at Amnesty International, which has been giving its street fundraisers £14 VR headsets and smartphones as part of its #360 Syria project. A threemonth trial saw 1,935 new donors sign up, worth £170,000 a year. ‘We now have a specialist tech and human rights unit, which is using real-time satellite technology to show forced displacement of the Rohingya in Myanmar, heat maps to show where a bomb has landed even if authorities are saying nothing has happened, and using geolocation and crowdsourcing to track incidents, such as chemical weapons attacks in Sudan. This technology isn’t new — advertising and marketing companies have been using it for a long time — but from an NGO perspective it’s early days.’ Amnesty international More Whether it’s the recent revelations about the use of prostitutes by senior Oxfam staff in Haiti, the collapse of Kids Company amid allegations of financial malpractice and sexual abuse, or the recurrent controversies over fundraising websites such as JustGiving taking a cut of public donations, trust in the charity sector is at an alltime low. In March, a survey by the not-for-profit research consultancy nfp Synergy found that only 54 per cent of people in the UK said they still trusted charities. Which is why innovative organisations are using technology to win back the support of digital natives who have little time for — or feel cynical about — charitable giving. ‘I call it “dev-tech” and it’s especially happening in London right now,’ says Rohan Silva, co-founder of the co-working space Second Home, where a number of the charities in question are based. ‘Geneva has the big NGOs headquartered there but barely any tech, whereas San Francisco has a global technology scene without the charities. London meanwhile has the technology, it has the big charities and it also has a community of small non-profit start-ups who are able to use that technology in a really efficient way.’ At Second Home there is Videre, a ‘21st-century Amnesty International’, which gives human rights activists cutting-edge hidden recording devices so they can testify to abuse; and Spring, which helps technology companies empowering women in Africa and Asia, such as Safe Boda, an ‘Uber for girls’, which organises safe motorcycle taxis for young women in Uganda. ‘The big names in this sector have tended to be notoriously slow on the uptake when it comes to innovation,’ says Grant Morgan, CEO of Louis Kennedy, a corporate social responsibility marketing consultancy. Safe More Story Continues ‘However,the landscape is changing. We’re currently developing a piece of technology using cryptocurrency, which will change the way we give globally — not just giving users the ability to track their donations, but to choose exactly what their money is spent on.’ ‘Blockchain is having a huge impact on the third sector,’ agrees Federico Malvezzi, project manager of AidCoin, a cryptocurrency specially designed for charities. ‘No record can be erased on the blockchain, meaning traceable accountability and zero fraud, and there’s no need for middle men or transaction fees. Plus, smart contracts could mean that if certain predetermined conditions aren’t fulfilled, donors would receive their donations back or be able to redirect them towards more deserving or pressing causes. In 2010, for example, the Red Cross raised $500 million (£370m) to provide homes for 130,000 people in Haiti. What would you have done with your donation upon realising that, five years later, only six homes had been built?’ Both the Red Cross and Save the Children have been trialling bitcoin donations, which have zero per cent processing fees. But some forward-thinking non-profits are going one step further and creating their own cryptocurrency. Charity: Water, founded by New York-based former nightclub promoter Scott Harrison, has developed a Clean Water Coin, which uses real-time video, GPS mapping and slick online slideshows to allow donors to follow every (virtual) penny. ‘I wanted to reinvent charity. I thought it had become broken and stigmatised,’ says Harrison, who has the support of the tech world’s glitterati, from Twitter’s Jack Dorsey to Spotify’s Daniel Ek. ‘Harrison runs Charity: Water like a great start-up,’ says Ek. ‘He’s disrupted the whole charity model.’ Bitcoin donations becoming more common More Vinay Nair is the co-founder of Lightful, a digital consultancy that helps smaller charities use social media more effectively. ‘We recently held a hackathon for Comic Relief, worked with the charity Climate Reality using chatbots to answer people’s questions and did a project for Parkinson’s UK where people affected by the disease could upload footage of their symptoms to Facebook. Today it’s about more than just rattling a tin and saying, “Please donate now” — it’s taking people on a journey and telling them a story.’ Indeed, the days of a teddy shaking a bucket at the Tube station might be numbered — research from YouGov indicated that one in seven people fail to donate because they no longer carry cash. Charitable donations through websites, social media and apps now account for £26 in every £100 donated in the UK and a recent trial of ‘tap and go’ contactless collection boxes found that supporters making contactless payments parted with three times as much as those fumbling in their pockets for change, potentially earning charities an extra £80m a year.

When it comes back up, it is. I need to know when it breaks that threshold so I can remotely toggle my rig at home … bitcoin is very volatile.”\nClearly, mining bitcoin is now decidedly mainstream, and not just for comedy gold. For many organizations, bitcoin mining gets less amusing as it increasingly forms the motivation for malware and cyberattacks.\nWhen episode writer Carrie Kemper uses the word “volatile,” though, it is an understatement. In April 2015, the value of bitcoin hovered around $230. Last December, it hit a high of nearly $20,000. The following February, it was down to $7,000.\nRecommended by Forbes\nWhen its value was a couple hundred dollars, bitcoin “mining” wasn’t cost-efficient. It requires a fast internet connection, creates electricity costs through power consumption and cooling, depletes storage space and takes time. When the value of a single bitcoin began to skyrocket, so did the profitability of bitcoin mining — and investment in it.\nCouple that rising value with increased competition and a depleting supply of bitcoins and the result is an increasingly serious cybersecurity problem.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue\n Website Feedback\n News Tip\n Report Corrections\n Reprints & Permissions\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael xie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael xie founder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilfoyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael xie michael xie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forbes technology council elite cios", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes contributors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "forbes.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortinet", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:17:45.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49654954fc17c15b5d61281d314501b00649560a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWjPtS_dgov4h__k_5iDoCFTbvV4Hw5lPlD7pwmZgd2_wevtWXcXvee2cdQ1lUPAgUA2uHjBBw8OVDZD35qRvuMT.XgWHwtjI-", "site_full": "motls.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://motls.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Reference Frame", "title": "Bitcoin Gold starts the era of 51% attacks", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold starts the era of 51% attacks", "published": "2018-05-25T16:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49654954fc17c15b5d61281d314501b00649560a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWjPtS_dgov4h__k_5iDoCFTbvV4Hw5lPlD7pwmZgd2_wevtWXcXvee2cdQ1lUPAgUA2uHjBBw8OVDZD35qRvuMT.XgWHwtjI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Luboš Motl (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-25T16:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold starts the era of 51% attacks", "text": "$18 million stolen, no one cares\nIn November, I explained to the dear readers that the Bitcoin futures trading would stop the inflation of the bubble and reverse the direction of the price towards zero. On December 9th, 2017, the cryptocurrency holders were urged to sell their holdings within a day .\nIndeed, those who listened to me were lucky to choose their source of information. In mid December, the Bitcoin price was peaking at $19,900. It's currently close to $7,500 . Virtually all of those who have shorted the Bitcoin futures have made a handsome profit – almost the same profit they could make by buying the cryptocurrencies before November 2017.\nThree weeks ago, the San Francisco Fed published a paper that claimed that the futures have indeed reversed the dynamics of the Bitcoin bubble. That's nice, Ladies and Gentlemen, but if you actually understood economics well, like I do, you would have predicted that – instead of rationalizing the events half a year later. Meanwhile, lots of events are finally taking place. The U.S. Department of Justice has started the investigation into the manipulation of cryptocurrency prices. It's very likely that some or most cryptoexchanges are spoofing – they are showing you supply and demand that is fake and won't be performed if you try – just in order to affect the people's behavior. Spoofing is illegal in the U.S. And some people have realized that they can steal (double spend) cryptocoins by the simple enough 51% attack. Exactly one week ago, someone stole 388,000 units of the Bitcoin Gold , the second most important fork of the Bitcoin (after Bitcoin Cash). At the current price around $46, that was worth some $18 million.\nThe victims were some large exchanges – unless it was an inside job and you can never be sure. If you read an article on a top Bitcoin Gold website , you will learn the simple story. Between May 16th and May 19th, nine blocks were reversed by the attacker in total. The attacker sent these 388,000 coins to the exchanges – and got a compensation for that – and he simultaneously sent the same money to his other Bitcoin Gold addresses.\nNormally, you can only spend once because one of the payments was classified as the \"first one\" and the second one is blocked because \"the money is no longer there\". The exchanges were using a temporary version of the history where the payment to the exchanges was the first one and legit – and the payment by the hacker by himself would therefore be blocked. However, the attacker invalidated this last piece of the history and created a longer sequence of blocks in which the payment to himself was the first one and legit – and the payment to the exchanges was therefore invalid.\nYou can watch the main fraudulent payee's address GTN...2Ft in real time. 12,239 BTG still seems to be there. The attacker seems capable of producing a block within 2 minutes or so. Because the blocks are normally discovered once in 10 minutes, he may have 5 times the power of the \"kosher miners of BTG\" i.e. some 83% of the total hashrate.\nNow, it is remarkably easy to perform such an attack against Bitcoin Gold or 1,600 other cryptocurrencies . Bitcoin Gold is currently the 27th largest cryptocurrency by capitalization – the capitalization is nearly $0.8 billion. But the hashpower working on the validation of the transactions is only 30 megahash per second right now. That's some nine orders of magnitude below that of the Bitcoin .\nYou need a bunch of computers to achieve that – and it's enough for you to borrow them. If you borrow such computers, e.g. a cluster at your university, you may easily rewrite the blocks, force the exchanges to pay the real money to you for your cryptocoins, and keep the cryptocoins, too. I am sure that even if you needed to borrow the CPU power, it would be vastly cheaper than $18 million. According to this website , the theoretical price of a 1-hour attack against Bitcoin Gold is below $3,000 and it's below $620,000 an hour even for the Bitcoin!\nAnyone who holds lots of these cryptocurrencies – except for the largest one – can use them so that he never runs out of them. You may have 388,000 Bitcoin Gold coins, you buy a villa for $18 million, and you still have 388,000 Bitcoin Gold coins afterwards. That's cute. Czech writer Charles Jaromír Erben wrote a famous fairy-tale Dear Mug, Do Cook , whatever is the English name or the translation. ;-) A poor widow helped an even older beggar near the pond and was given a cool mug. The mug was controlled by voice recognition, \"Mug, Do Cook\" starts the process. And the mug never runs out of mash. She forgot to say \"Mug, Do Stop\" so the farmers had to bite through the mug while returning to the village. Cryptocurrencies are just like this magical mug.\nFor larger currencies, some minor mining pools may do the same. For example, Slushpool, the 3rd-5th largest Bitcoin mining pool which resides in Czechia, could easily switch to Bitcoin Cash and become a majority miner, one capable of reversing the blocks just like the Bitcoin Gold attacker. The Chinese government can do the same to the Bitcoin itself if it orders the China-based bosses of the largest Bitcoin mining pools to do something similar to what the Bitcoin Gold attacker did.\nThere is really no \"solution\" here. The whole point of the cryptocurrencies is that the validation is decided by the algorithms and miners automatically. So the 51% attack \"shouldn't happen\" and when it does happen, it's a problem for the humans that is considered \"a kosher successful transfer [legal theft] by the blockchain rules of the game\" – or it must be fixed by the humans and their old-fashioned laws, courts, and methods to deal with thefts.\nMost cryptocurrencies' total hashrate is so small that individual thieves may easily do what has happened to Bitcoin Gold – it's remarkable that it's not happening much more frequently. (Well, it seems that the transactions were stopped at Bitcoin Gold, see the explorer , so all the \"lively trade\" of BTG at the cryptoexchanges is bogus because no actual coins may be moved according to the blockchain algorithms.) And several largest cryptocurrencies have such a huge hashrate that the mining wastes as much electricity as Ireland usefully consumes .\nBecause there are several public blockchains, the smaller ones may be instantly 51% attacked by those who have enough mining power to be big players in the bigger currencies. And if and when the 51% attacks will spread towards the top 5 cryptocurrencies, and it is totally possible, not even the top 3 cryptocurrencies' holders should think that they're safe.\nOne may also increase the \"required number of confirmations\", but then the cryptocurrency becomes really slow as a payment method.\nSo far, the victims were the cryptoexchanges and they say that \"no one else should be afraid of anything\". It's debatable. There is nothing special about the cryptoexchanges. The Bitcoin Gold sales could have taken place between several multimillionaires or a criminal multimillionaire and many small holders, too. It's pretty shocking that even after the successful 51% attack – when 1.5 times the daily volume ($12 million) was stolen – there is no panic selling of the Bitcoin Gold. (Well, maybe you can't really sell it now, or the listed price is not reflecting the actual market now.) The people owning Bitcoin Gold share stubbornness that most of us surely classify as collective stupidity.\nIn recent two months, such 51%-style attacks occurred against Verge, Electroneum, Bitcoin Gold, and Monacoin . The article I just linked to says that \"You can successfully hack a $2B cryptocurrency network with only $1.5M\". Not bad. More precisely, it is very bad!\nThe people who have economic thinking realize that the \"investment\" into the cryptocurrencies is a classic example of a bubble or a Ponzi scheme attracting morons. But there's a lot of the politically correct worshiping of the blockchain idea even among these critics of the Bitcoin bubble. But the blockchain is an extremely lame technology to be used in the real world. It's forcing all nodes to remember a huge amount of worthless data (the Ethereum blockchain is over a terabyte now), leads to a huge waste of electricity, and whenever it doesn't, the network is at risk of being 51% attacked. Whenever that happens, people have to use the old-fashioned definitions of a \"thief\", anyway, so the added value of the blockchain – the idea that the blockchain algorithms should be trusted – is eliminated, anyway.\nIf someone is remembering \"who owns what\" – like commercial banks and land registries do – the humans inside simply have to have the responsibility for the integrity of the data. You can't \"decentralize\" the responsibility, and if someone offers you a solution where no one has this responsibility anymore, it's a solution where you can't really sue anyone when you're robbed – and this blog post is about a story proving that you can easily be robbed.

Cryptocurrency markets also tend to be volatile, which can make fraud-derived prices difficult to distinguish from natural trends.\nThis particular investigation concerns manipulation of Bitcoin and Ether, the report said. Publication of the report caused the value of Bitcoin to drop by nearly 5 percent, to below $7,500.\nThe Justice Department is conducting its investigation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nCracking down on cryptocurrencies This isn’t the first time the government has attempted to crack down on illegal practices within the cryptocurrency space.\nIn March, the SEC issued a statement saying that “if a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an ‘exchange,’ as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.”\n“The federal regulatory framework governing registered national securities exchanges and exempt markets is designed to protect investors and prevent against fraudulent and manipulative trading practices,” the statement said.\nLast year, the SEC warned celebrities against endorsing ICOs without proper disclosure.\n“Celebrities who endorse an investment often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure that the investment is appropriate and in compliance with federal securities laws,” the SEC said in a statement. “Investment decisions should not be based solely on an endorsement by a promoter or other individual.”\nStay up to date with important consumer news: Oops! something went wrong, mind trying again?

commonly known as BTC Global – may have fleeced up to 28 000 investors .\n“The serious economic offences unit has been tasked to investigate the massive alleged fraud,” stated the Hawks in a media release. “Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2% interest per day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month.”\nA representative of BitCaw trading, however, denied in a Facebook message to Fin24 that the firm was linked to BTC Global. \"BitCaw Trading was not involved in the BTC Global Scam & we are shocked to see our name connected with it,\" read the message.\n\"BitCaw Trading assists people with buying & selling Bitcoin as well as other Bitcoin related services. We do not manage third party money or offer any kind of investment.\"\nMaster trades\nBTC Global on its website offered amazing deals to investors via its shadowy “master trader” Steven Twain. And Twain, states a message posted to the group's site, has disappeared.\n“The admin team cannot locate him,” states the message. “If anyone has any information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know.”\nBut the issue is further complicated by the fact that on social media support groups investors allege Twain never existed and his creation was part of an elaborate scam.\n“Steven Twain is an alias and not a real person,” states a post on the Facebook group BTC Global Scam, which has 743 likes.\nOther blogs have been created to argue that Twain is a real person.\nOn one such blog, a South African woman named Cheri Ward writes that while she does not own BTC Global, she was in contact with Twain and created the btcglobal.team website with colleagues.\n“We built the btcglobal.team website to help people to create their profiles and to ask questions because we couldn’t handle all the queries and nor could Steven.\n“I had direct contact with Steven and I continue to have direct contact with admin, the leaders and many members,” she writes. She posts screengrabs of text message conversation with someone who is apparently Twain. When asked why he does not send through an image of himself, and whether he is \"super shy\", he replies \"yes. Very\".\nBut Ward writes on her blog she never interacted with Twain directly and only talked to him “on messenger and email”.\n“I pushed him [Twain] for a live video and asked him to address us all on Skype. He was dead set against it. I knew that if I pushed harder he would pull away. As a leadership we decided that we would let him have his peace, he had after all been making payments on time every Monday to hundreds of people without any trouble.”\nFin24 was not able to establish what her relationship to the company is, apart from creating the website and promoting the company.\nHer cellphone went to voicemail when Fin24 called her on Friday morning.\nNever the Twain shall meet\nThe message now on BTC Global’s website – posted by “the admin team” - states that the only contact they had with Twain was via Facebook and a Gmail address.\nFin24 sent emails to the address which were not replied to.\n“We are as shocked and angry as everyone. But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven,” the message states. “Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.\"\nBefore the message was posted that Twain absconded with the money, BTC Global had sold itself as a way to make massive returns quickly.\n“Through our partnership with Steven, BTC Global have secured access to guaranteed 14% WEEKLY returns from as little as $1,000 in your account,” it states.\nTwain is described as having “6 years of experience trading binary options with consistent success, over the last 3 years he has started providing trading services for other large account holders ($10,000+ only)\".\nHis Facebook profile also appears to have been deleted.\nBloomberg reports Bitcoin prices have declined 45% this year and 58% since the high of $19 511 reached on December 18.

Follow Catherine West converted his profits into Bitcoin (Source: Getty) Catherine Neilan Police have seized around half a million pounds worth of bitcoin from a \"prolific\" hacker in the first case of its kind for the Met.\nGrant West was responsible for attacks on more than 100 companies worldwide, obtaining the financial data of tens of thousands of people though phishing scams, which he would then sell on the dark web before converting the profit into bitcoins.\nWest attacked the websites of 17 major firms including Sainsbury 's, Nectar, Groupon, AO.com, Ladbrokes , Coral Betting, Uber , Vitality, RS Feva Class Association 2017, Asda , the British Cardiovascular Society, Mighty Deals Limited, Truly Experiences Ltd, T Mobile, M R Porter, the Finnish Bitcoin exchange, and Argos .\nHe also carried out a phishing scam masquerading as online takeaway service Just Eat , in an attempt to obtain the personal details of 165,000 people. Although no financial information was obtained, his actions cost the firm approximately £200,000.\nHe was sentenced today at Southwark Crown Court to 10 years and eight months’ imprisonment. And, for the first time, the Met seized £500,000 in cryptocurrency.\nOfficers from the Met’s Police Cyber Crime Unit (MPCCU) arrested and charged West in September 2017 following a two-year investigation. He was identified as the head of an Organised Crime Network (OCN) which predominantly targeted London-based organisations.\nAs well as financial data, he also sold cannabis which he shipped to customers, and ‘how to’ guides instructing others how to carry out cyber attacks.\nWest also regularly used stolen credit card details to pay for items for himself, including holidays, food, shopping and household goods.\nThe 26-year-old, of Ashcroft Caravan Park, Sheerness, Kent, pleaded guilty to 10 different offences. His girlfriend Rachael Brookes, 26, of Denbigh, North Wales pleaded guilty to unauthorised use of computer material.\nDetective chief superintendent Mick Gallagher, head of the Met’s Organised Crime Command, said: \"This case illustrates the lengths that our detectives will go to in order to pursue offenders on the dark web. We will use many different measures to ensure such offenders are identified, prosecuted and their assets are seized.\n\"This is the first time we have seized a cryptocurrency and we are determined to remain one step ahead of cyber criminals who believe they can act with impunity.\" Share", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://iptc.org/std/rNews/2011-10-07#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "argos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine neilan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sainsbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british cardiovascular society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty) catherine neilan police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truly experiences ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city a.m. follow catherine west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ladbrokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mighty deals limited", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "groupon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:25:11.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c59740defbfe4a9b046d26ea65e1d81fbbf44055", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx11IM0IfDirCrBa8mDifrsXCPtBeenoqgNuA9nFIYBL_IBNyeubz5ti1ObTeGGVHzKd", "site_full": "www.rttnews.com", "site": "rttnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.rttnews.com/RSS/Technology.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "education"], "section_title": "RTT -

Bitcoin.com buttons are seen displayed on the floor of the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology conference in New York City, New York, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Segar\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.\nReporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Joe Brock/Keith Weir Share Or Comment On This Article Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Capitalbay.

The next support levels could be at around $6,600 marked by the low in early April, as bulls run for cover.\nIt would appear a number of factors may have conspired to trigger renewed selling, dating back to the problems at the South Korean exchanges Bithumb and UpBit that surfaced following a raid by the authorities on the latter two weeks ago.\nThat rekindled fears about a regulatory clampdown, and that train of thought has been strengthened by the news the US Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into price manipulation in the crypto markets. US and UK regulators go hunting for price manipulators and ICO fraudsters\nPractices outlawed in mainstream equity markets are allegedly widespread in bitcoin and other crypto markets, but crypto exchange surveillance systems are unlikely to be strong enough to identify problems let alone rectify them.\nBloomberg reports that the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are working together on the investigation, which apparently is targeting activities such as spoofing, where traders make orders they have no intention of following through on in order to create a false impression of buying and selling activity, and thereby effecting price manipulation.\nNot mentioned in the Bloomberg report is what is thought to be one of the most rampant forms of manipulation - the \"pump and dump\".\nPump and dump schemes involve traders acting \"in consort\" to encourage others to buy a coin, often by buying low themselves, then spreading rumours about some imminent positive news flow.\nAs the price starts to rise the conspiring traders dump their coins forcing the price into a decline in which the unsuspecting lose money.\nWith such immature markets where liquidity can be thin, especially among the smaller coins, manipulation may be fairly easy to accomplish.\nAlso, there is a thin line between the fact that some coins, including bitcoin, are comparatively tightly held, which means that the perfectly legitimate actions of relatively few sellers and buyers can have an outsized impact on the market price and outright dishonest manipulation.\nJohn McAfee, the tech entrepreneur and fan of crypto, was accused at the end of last year of orchestrating pump and dump schemes with his \"Coin of the Day\" tweets, which led to spikes in the prices of the coins he named.\nMany 'pump and dump' and other forms of price manipulation schemes are organised through messaging apps such as Telegram.\nMany of the groups are legitimate, but it is difficult to sift the good from the bad. Wash trading, where investors \"buy\" shares they already own to give a false impression of trading activity in a coin, is also thought to be prevalent in the industry. Greater oversight from regulators is, to say the least, overdue.\nEarlier in the week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that US and Canadian regulators are working together to close fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs). The plan, called Operation Cryptosweep, has 70 open operations and another 35 pending.\nJoseph Borg, president of the North American Securities Administration Association said in comments highlighting the extent of the investigations, that \"the action announced today is just the tip of the iceberg\".\nThe first results of that clampdown are seen in moves by state securities regulators in California and Alabama, with cease-and-desist orders issued a couple of days ago to ShipChain, a logistics blockchain project in California, and Extrabit, LEV and Platinum projects in Alabama.\nAll of those ICOs mentioned have been accused of selling unregistered securities.\nBillions of dollars have been raised in token crowd sales, and it is probably the most popular and successful use of blockchain technology to date, and threatens to transform how tech start-ups raise seed and venture capital funds.\nOn 17 May, the Wall Street Journal published an investigation it has conducted into 1,450 ICOs, and found that 271 raised red flags, estimating investor loses at $273 million, although the WSJ did not provide the names of the suspect projects.\nAmong the most common red flags were fake executive teams, plagiarised whitepapers and promises of guarantee returns to investors.\nOther factors hurting market sentiment include fears about the so called Mt.Gox whale - the bankruptcy trustee of the now defunct Mt.Gox exchange appointed by the Japanese court to look after funds once held by the exchange - dumping coins on the market.\nOther poorly received news saw the Bitfinex exchange forced to hand over client details to the tax authorities in the US, although that in itself would not be a cause of selling as such actions would potentially create taxable events for US crypto taxpayers.\nThe UK ' s Financial Conduct Authority is currently investigating 24 crypto-related businesses, according to a report in the Financial Times today. Coinbase and Circle moves\nCoinbase, likely to be an exchange that would benefit from tighter regulation given its deeper pockets than most and better surveillance mechanisms, has acquired the decentralized crypto exchange Paradex.\nAs part of that move it is rebranding its GDAX crypto exchange Coinbase Pro, as it seeks to cater for all areas of the trading market.\nGDAX, unlike its parent, does not take fiat deposits but Coinbase Pro, which is now live, does. Both GDAX and Coinbase Pro have markets in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and Litecoin.\nGDAX and Coinbase Pro, in addition to allowing trading of crypto against other crypto, provide customers with access to the private keys of their coins, while the more consumer-friendly Coinbase does not.\nYou can also make limit orders on GDAX and Coinbase Pro, but only market orders on Coinbase, where fees are also much higher.\nCircle, the payments startup backed by Goldman Sachs, has introduced a “Buy the Market” feature in which clients can buy an index comprised of a basket of coins.\nThe Circle Invest app, launched in November last year, will allow investors to buy seven coins in one go, with each coin weighted according to its market capitalisation. The coins are bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Zcash and Monero.\nThe app is only available in the US, but the company has plans to expand into Europe, although no timetable has been released. The company will make money from the index trades through a 1% spread on the buying and selling price.\nStaying with the new breed of trading apps, European mobile financial app Revolut, that has been making waves recently with a younger crowd, has added Ripple ' s XRP token and Bitcoin Cash to its crypto line-up, in addition to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Eth that are already available.\nAs with Circle Invest, it charges no commission on trades but has a spread of 1.5% between the buy and sell prices.\nHowever, unlike Circle, clients are not directly purchasing crypto but instead gain exposure to the price movements of the underlying assets via contracts for differences (CFDs).\nA Series C founding round in April raised a whopping $250 million, which values the company at $1.7 billion, propelling it into the ranks of the few European-based tech \"unicorns\" valued at more than $1 billion.\nThe latest funding round was led DST Global, the venture arm of Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, with Index Ventures and Balderton Capital also taking part. Revolut growth, UK crypto task force meets, EOS to go live\nVlad Yatsenko, co-founder and chief technical officer of Revolut, said: \"We ' ve been asking the Revolut community which Cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming.\n\"After months of negotiations and development work, we ' re incredibly excited to offer exposure to these two digital currencies to the UK market.\"\nRevolut has 1.7 million customers across Europe and is successfully using its crypto markets to make its offering more attractive to younger people.\nWhen crypto trading was first introduced on the app last year, users had to pay a £15 charge to trade crypto only to see the company provide it free of charge to all customers at a later date, attracting complaints and demands for reimbursement from early adopters.\nThe UK government ' s Cryptoassets Task Force met this week and representatives from HM Treasury, the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority were in attendance.\nThe objectives of the group were set out at the meeting and include exploring the impact of crypto, understanding its benefits and challenges and \"assessing what. If any, regulation is required in response\".\nAndrew Baily, the chief executive of the FCA , commented: \"Cryptoassets have been an area of increasing interest for markets and regulators globally including the FCA. We look forward to working with our counterparts at the Bank of England and the Treasury as part of the taskforce to develop thinking and policy on cryptoassets.\"\nThese articles are provided for information purposes only.

He still fully expects that the Bitcoin price will reach $25,000 by the end of the year. Crypto Market Unexpectedly Slips, Falls By Over 7%\nTom Lee, known as a “chronic” bull in the cryptocurrency community, reiterated his belief that Bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of the year. He has long been the face of the industry as he regularly appears on CNBC segments regarding this growing market, showing up on a weekly basis.\nHis recent announcement during the CNBC Futures Now segment came after a 1% decrease in the price of Bitcoin.\nHowever, not even 24 hours after Tom’s Futures Now appearance, Bitcoin dropped by over five percent to under $7,600. This negative price action has wiped out the majority of price gains seen pre-Consensus.\nHowever, Bitcoin did not fall as much as altcoins and actually gained market dominance, moving from 37% to 38%.\nThis has been a common theme as altcoin investors tend to jump ship when waters turn murky for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, has further proven itself to be a store of value and a so-called “shelter in the storm” in this emerging market. Battered but Positive, Tom Lee Stands by Price Prediction\nWhile Lee was quick to call this surprising drop “typical crypto volatility” in an email sent to CNBC, during his appearance on Futures Now , he recognized three aspects which have assured his bullish price predictions.\nThe first aspect that he mentioned was the cost of the creation of Bitcoin, or in more simple terms, mining. He highlighted the fact that the electricity, equipment, and other assorted costs of mining a Bitcoin is approximately $8,000.\nHowever, after yesterday’s drop, he noted that the cost of mining a Bitcoin had dropped to $6,000. Taking into account that the current price of Bitcoin versus the newly lowered cost of mining one, many still see Bitcoin as an undervalued asset.\nHe also noted that he expects an even higher level of institutional involvement to arrive later this year, saying:\nI think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty.\nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Lee still expressed his positive attitude, stating:\nBut that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies.\nWhen looking at market statistics, it is clear to see why he still holds positive sentiment despite the over 60% price decrease in Bitcoin since its December highs. In the past 5 months, venture capitalist firms have poured over $1.3 billion dollars into cryptocurrency startups.\nTake the example of the heavily publicized announcement of Goldman Sachs’ entry into the cryptocurrency industry. The announcement made earlier this year saw the Sachs-backed Circle purchase the Poloniex crypto exchange, with the end result of Circle reaching a valuation of $3 billion.\nOn the surface, a three billion dollar company in a $350 billion industry may seem irrelevant. However, this is just one of the major examples which show that institutional investors and companies are willing to get invested in this industry.\nIf Tom Lee’s expectations become reality, there will be a countless number of investments made in this industry.\nFinally, to put a cherry on the Bitcoin’s metaphorical top, Tom recognized statistics put together by his market analysis firm, Fundstrat, stating:\nHistorically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin’s price.\nIf history is any indication, that means a run for Bitcoin will happen fast, possibly skyrocketing within a matter of a few days or weeks.\nTom Lee put it best saying:\nSo as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.\nWhat do you think of Tom Lee’s expectations and analysis? Do you think he is too hopeful, has just the right amount, or is he actually underestimating the price of cryptocurrencies in the future? We would love to hear what you are thinking, so please let us know in the comments below.\nImages Courtesy of Shutterstock and Bitcoinist archives.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-announces-new-products-institutional-investors/", "http://bitcoinist.com/4-reasons-bitcoin-price-volatility/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/as-bitcoin-plunges-mega-bull-tom-lee-stands-by-his-25000-target.html", "http://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-backed-circle-buys-poloniex-cryptocurrency-exchange-400m/", "http://bitcoinist.com/2018-year-venture-capital-investment-cryptocurrency-market/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "permabull tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T23:04:14.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d0ccb2043f675eee857fc469cbadeec7f8c7e71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ5ko8FWCTyIiDFWaadls4Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-25T16:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d0ccb2043f675eee857fc469cbadeec7f8c7e71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ5ko8FWCTyIiDFWaadls4Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "efeyigit399", "published": "2018-05-25T16:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "text": "BitCoin is the most universal coin of the world of crypto currencies.

If only you had chosen a particular cryptocurrency before it rallied in price, you would be much happier.\nHowever, this does not help as we cannot go back in time. We cannot buy a cryptocurrency in the past. We can only focus on picking the coins currently that are most likely to give us such returns.\nCurrently, there are a few coins that have the potential to rally in the next couple of months. These are some of the largest “Altcoins” or alternative coins.\nIn this short post, we will take a look at some of the most promising altcoins that are likely to take the market by storm. First things First\nBefore you can invest in any cryptocurrency, you have to get yourself set up with a cryptocurrency broker. This will allow you to enter the positions in the coins that we are about to talk about. You should also make sure that you use only the best brokers.\nThere are many brokers these days that will try to sell you their services. The problem is that the vast majority of them are scam brokers. This means that they are unregulated and will not return your profits or coins.\nYou can find a range of regulated cryptocurrency brokers online but your best bet is to probably use a broker like IQ Option. IQ Option is one of the biggest CFD brokers in Europe and they are fully regulated by the FCA and by CySec.\nThey also have a range of cryptocurrencies and have one of the most advanced platforms on the market. If you would like more information you should read IQ Option broker reviews .\nNow that you have the means to trade cryptocurrencies, we can move right onto the topic of the most profitable coins to invest in. Ripple (XRP)\nMost cryptocurrency enthusiasts want to get rid of banks.\nThey think that financial institutions are the pediment to progress of decentralised freedom. However, this may be the wrong headed way to go about it.\nThere is a benefit from working with the banks to make payments much more efficient and cheap. This is exactly what Ripple XRP is doing. They have developed a protocol that is able to use digital assets to move funds across the world in a matter of seconds.\nThe native token in their protocol is the XRP liquidity token. This is what is used to settle payments across the world.\nThe Ripple company is trying to sell their technology to a number of banks. If the banks are to use this technology, it will mean that they need to get themselves the XRP liquidity token.\nThis will create a great deal of demand for the token which will drive the price up considerably. Currently, the token is only sitting at $0.67.\nWhat is important to note is that the amount of XRP that has ever being printed is limited. No more can ever be produced. This means that if supply were to increase greatly, then the price is most likely to follow.\nThere have been estimates that the price of the XRP token is likely to hit $10 within the next three years. Hence, this is no doubt a coin that you may want to consider including in your portfolio. Monero (XMR)\nThere is one big misconception with Bitcoin currently. That is the notion that it is private. People think that when they use Bitcoin to buy things, that they are anonymous.\nUnfortunately, that is only half true.\nYou see, Bitcoin is a pseudo-anonymous. Although the wallet address that you use is just a random collection of numbers, they can easily be tracked on the blockchain.\nThere are companies that use advanced algorithms that are able to track exactly where payments are coming and going. This means that the moment you try to take your money to an exchange, your name will be exposed.\nThis is exactly why privacy coins such as Monero are the best alternatives in today’s day and age. Monero is a privacy coin that cannot be tracked because they use advanced cryptography which is able to shield the blockchain from the public.\nHence, when you send XMR on the Monero network, no one knows how much XMR is in your wallet and they do not know where payments have come from.\nIt is this reason that a number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts have started using Monero so extensively. It is also one of the most decentralised cryptocurrencies as they are actively against any sort of miner centralisation.\nCurrently, the price of XMR is sitting at $250. It has been as high as $450 only a few months ago.\nThere are many analysts who see XMR reaching as much as $1,000 by the end of the year. As more traders learn to appreciate the risks that come with holding Bitcoin, they are likely to start adopting Monero. Conclusion\nThere are many cryptocurrency options on the market today. There are also many traders who are proclaiming that the coins that they have are likely to be the next Bitcoin.\nThis is unfortunately quite a stale comment as there is only one Bitcoin. There are, however, a number of other coins that have completely different technology and use cases. These coins are yet to be discovered by the main stream and adopted widely.\nMonero and Ripple are two such coins. The latter is likely to make international payments and absolute breeze. The former is going to make sure that all of your transactions are effectively hidden from the public.\nAlthough we have recommended these two tokens as having the potential to rally over the coming months, it is essential that you do your own research. Make sure that you are comfortable with the amounts that you are investing and never invest more than you can afford.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://getmonero.org/", "http://binarytradingclub.com/bitcoin-binary-option-brokers/", "https://ripple.com/", "https://www.coinbureau.com/review/iq-option-cryptocurrency/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:23:13.067+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "200e7f73d11f1af98fe720733e05a5bc3b4aa770", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTfKjbpits_Gk6VQuAZB5354SzIN8G2ie3ztXVn9TssaFgmYxTYHwlCkomAECu388IolKY1UV_U3vB4Yooth35fhP8gn7oT4wDnF.qZIjxPOq3460XFcOIy52Bw0ooBaN1rij_OZWpl8AeSv6f7r3TRkyEeiBXFqI-", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Gold suffers double spend attacks, $17.5 million lost | ZDNet", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold suffers double spend attacks, $17.5 million lost | ZDNet", "published": "2018-05-25T16:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/25/a5957fb6-9bc8-42f1-873b-db28733d924c/thumbnail/770x578/8bbacb7c9bc1a3cb47e7efa99a2c24d5/screen-shot-2018-05-25-at-08-12-26.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "200e7f73d11f1af98fe720733e05a5bc3b4aa770", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTfKjbpits_Gk6VQuAZB5354SzIN8G2ie3ztXVn9TssaFgmYxTYHwlCkomAECu388IolKY1UV_U3vB4Yooth35fhP8gn7oT4wDnF.qZIjxPOq3460XFcOIy52Bw0ooBaN1rij_OZWpl8AeSv6f7r3TRkyEeiBXFqI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Charlie Osborne", "published": "2018-05-25T16:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold suffers double spend attacks, $17.5 million lost | ZDNet", "text": "File Photo Bitcoin Gold (BTG) appears to be the target of a 51 percent attack, leading to the theft of approximately $17.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges.\nMore security news FBI won't say how many investigations are hindered by encryption ​Apple privacy update: Now it's easier to download all the data it has about you Why even the best free VPNs are not a risk worth taking What is GDPR? Everything you need to know about the new general data protection regulations We're all a bit of Trump when it comes to cybersecurity Traders of the coin, established in 2017 through a hard fork of the main Bitcoin (BTC) network, have been tracing the attack since last week.\nScrutiny of unusual activity on the network has revealed the scheme, in which \"double spending\" attacks have been launched against cryptocurrency exchanges trading the virtual currency.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Gold team , exchanges rather than individual users have been targeted.\nThe first attack was recorded on 16 May and have now appeared to have ceased.\n\"An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use \"51 percent attacks\" to perform \"double spend\" attacks to steal money from exchanges,\" the team says. \"We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits. There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held.\"\n51 percent attacks force reorganization in the blockchain. While not the result of a security flaw or vulnerabilities, the attack can -- theoretically -- be launched against any blockchain.\nIf a threat actor manages to wrestle control of over 50 percent of a network's computing power, they are able to both modify and exclude transactions of their own coins from blocks.\nAttackers are then able to double spend, in which transactions are reversed after being confirmed, as well as prevent all other miners on a network from mining valid blocks.\nLaunching these types of attacks can be expensive and due to the vast computing power required, the only way they are made profitable is to attempt large double spend transactions -- and this, in turn, pivots attacks towards cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe wallet address connected to the 51 percent scheme has received 388,201 BTG, which is worth approximately $17.5 million at the time of writing.\nThe majority of the funds have been moved to other addresses and only roughly 12,000 BTG remains in the account.\n\"One of the targeted exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past,\" the Bitcoin Gold team says. \"In their words, \"we are 100 percent sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.\"\nIn response to the threat actor's attacks, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges have ramped up the number of confirmations they require to accept large transactions.\nThe Bitcoin Gold team says that a major upgrade planned for the end of June -- now being pushed to take place as soon as possible -- will eradicate the use of ASIC hardware to mine BTG.\nASIC systems are expected to ship at approximately the same time and have the potential to cause an imbalance to existing miners, and therefore, the team is tampering with the BTG algorithm to prevent this from occurring.\nThe organization says that the change in algorithm and a new fork will also reduce the risk of 51 percent attacks in the future.\nSee also: Brutal cryptocurrency mining malware crashes your PC when discovered\n\"We've been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet,\" the team says. \"[...] While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it's best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can.\"\nAccording to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, recent estimates suggest that since 2017, cyberattackers have managed to steal $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies from exchanges, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), wallets, and more.\nA similar attack method has recently been employed against Verge, a cryptocurrency offering which claims to bring back the anonymity once associated with cryptocurrency as a whole.\nEarlier this week , reports surfaced which claimed that a threat actor has been able to successfully launch a 51 percent attack on the Verge blockchain, leading to the theft of approximately 35 million Verge coins (XVG), worth over $1.7 million.\nHow Blockchain technologies are transforming...

The cryptocurrency market results were mixed, with the top ten coins generally within a two percentage point range, up or down.\nBitcoin has paused at the $7,500 per single coin level as of mid-morning, a less than one percent drop from yesterday’s measure. The lack of activity was welcome after a week that saw its value plummet more than $1,000 and threaten to drop even further.\nThe rest of the market was sluggish, with ether, EOS and Stellar the lone breakouts to green arrows, but all less than two percent higher.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending May 25, 2018 at 4:57 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $8,200.00 on the Livecoin exchange at 4:37 am today. Livecoin saw $14,264,300 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $6,841.13 on CoinsBank’s exchange at 3:07 pm today. CoinsBank’s 24 hour volume was $15,831,100.\nThe average price on the surveyed exchanges, as weighed by volume, was $7,508.59.\nVolatility was a bit lower than average, with the BlockTribune Volatility Index coming in at 45.0. A higher number indicates greater price volatility with 50 describing an average day.\nThese statistics were consolidated from 16 different exchanges.

The 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the downside.\nThis suggests that a breakdown is more likely to happen than a bounce. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to show accelerating bearish momentum.\nAlso, price is below the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point to reflect continued selling pressure. RSI is heading south to show that sellers have the upper hand, but the oscillator is already dipping into oversold territory to signal exhaustion.\nTurning higher could draw buyers back in and lead to a bounce back to the resistance. Similarly, stochastic is indicating oversold conditions but has yet to turn higher to signal a return in bullish pressure.\nRegulatory fears are being blamed for the recent leg lower in bitcoin price, although this could prove positive for the industry in the longer run. The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a criminal probe into price manipulation practices involving cryptocurrencies.

While drops are slowing down and becoming smaller, traders are again being offered a solid showing of just how vulnerable the cryptocurrency space remains.\nBitcoin has fallen by more than $200 since our last price piece and is now trading for $7,502. The price experienced a serious drop earlier this week, toppling from over $8,000 to the mid-$7,000 range – the lowest it has been since early April.\nThese sudden and continual drops have raised serious questions regarding the vulnerability of Bitcoin’s price and its exposure to outside manipulation. Authorities from the United States Justice Department are now beginning an investigation of illicit trading practices and price manipulations in both Bitcoin and altcoin arenas.\nRepresentatives of the Department have explained that they will be examining specific tactics that can potentially cause negative swings in crypto prices. These include spoofing (also known as market rigging) and fake order market flooding, which can trick traders into poorly evaluated buys and sells.\nFederal prosecutors are also working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to gather relative data. Per University of Texas finance professor John Griffin, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies remain heavy targets of criminals and illicit activity.
