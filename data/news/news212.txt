The cryptocurrency is best known for volatility of its exchange rate to key fiat currencies and other commodities, but the more interesting aspect of the Bitcoin (and other cryptos) is their hunger for energy. Cryptos are based on blockchain technologies that promise a range of benefits (majority unverified or untested or both), amongst which the high degree of security and peer-to-peer data registry, both of which are supported by the mining processes that effectively require deployment of a vast amount of hash/algorithmic calculations in order to create data storage units, or blocks. In a sense, energy (electricity) is the main input into creation of blockchain records of transactions.\nAs the result, it is important to understand Bitcoin (and other cryptos) energy efficiency and utilisation, from three perspectives:\n1) Direct efficiency - value added by the use of energy in mining Bitcoin per unit of BTC and unit of information recorded on a blockchain;\n2) Economic efficiency or opportunity cost of using the energy expended on mining; and\n3) Environmental efficiency - the environmental impact of energy used.\nTo-date, estimating the total demand for electricity arising from Bitcoin mining (let alone from mining of other cryptos) has been a huge challenge, primarily because Bitcoin miners are too often located in secretive jurisdiction, do not report any data about their operations and, quite often, can be highly atomistic. Although Bitcoin mining is a concentrated activity - with a small number of mega-miners and mining pools dominating the market - there is still a cottage industry of amateur and smaller scale miners sprinkled around the globe.\nThus, to-date, we have only very scant understanding of just how much of the scarce resource (energy) does the new industry of cryptos mining consume.\nA new paper, published in a peer-reviewed journal, Joule, which is a reputable academic journal, titled \" Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem \" and authored by Alex de Viries (Experience Center of PwC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) attempts exactly this. The paper is the first in the literature to be peer-reviewed and uses a new methodology to discern trends in Bitcoin's electric energy consumption. The paper does not cover other cryptos, so its conclusions need to be scaled to estimate the entire impact of cryptocurrencies energy use.\nThe findings of de Viries are striking. He estimates the current Bitcoin usage of energy at 2.55 gigawatts, close to that of Ireland (3.1GW), approaching 7.67GW that \"could already be reached in 2018\", comparable to Austria (8.2GW). When reached, this will amount to 0.5% of the total world electricity consumption.\nPer 'efficiency of blockchain', a single transaction on Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. Which is, put frankly, mad, wasteful and utterly unrealistic as far as transactions costs go for the network.\nPer de Viries: \"As per mid-March 2018, about 26 quintillion hashing operations are performed every second and non-stop by the Bitcoin network (Figure 1). At the same time, the Bitcoin network is only processing 2–3 transactions per second (around 200,000 transactions per day). This means that the ratio of hash calculations to processed transactions is 8.7 quintillion to 1 at best. The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity.\"\nThe key to the above numbers is that they vastly underestimate the true costs of Bitcoin and other cryptos to the global economy. The paper focuses solely on energy used on mining. However, other activities that sustain Bitcoin and blockchains are also energy-intensive, including trading in coins/tokens, storage of information blocks, etc. Worse, mining and processing / servicing of the networks required use of constant electricity supply, which means that the energy mix that goes to sustain cryptocurrencies operations is the worst from environmental quality perspective and must rely on heavy use of fossil fuels in the top up range of electricity demand spectrum. The environmental costs of Bitcoin and cryptos is staggering.\nScaling up Bitcoin figures from de Viries; paper to include other major cryptocurrencies would require factoring in the BTC's share of the total crypto markets by energy use. A proxy (an imperfect one) for this is BTC's total share of the cryptocurrencies publicly traded markets which stood at around 37.3% as of May 16, 2018. Assuming this proxy holds for mining and servicing costs, total demand for electricity from the cryptocurrencies and blockchain use around the world is more than 2.55GW/0.37 or more than 6.9GW, with de Viries' model implying that by year end, the system of cryptocurrencies can be burning through a staggering 1.35% of total electricity supply around the world.\nThe problem with the key cryptocurrencies proposition is that the system of blockchain-based public networks can deliver lower cost, higher efficiency alternatives to current records creation and storage. This proposition simply does not hold in the current energy demand environment.\nThe full paper can be read here: de Vries: \" Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem \" http://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6 .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "scary inefficiency & environmental costs of bitcoin  bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T19:13:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27044b0a5554ede41395b78c8657fa4b0968a095", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4lCSzNBgW1_2ueF7WCwUXV3sqWsH.gMr9p1Xz8ZixrQQmJSXqPj.HMzeiH9qrwoYwU2r3.WBYrC44mCzSJ3eoiFuMLI.77rzD_q8Ip3PlVtG8AiC3ROfV", "site_full": "wallstreetexaminer.com", "site": "wallstreetexaminer.com", "site_section": "http://wallstreetexaminer.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Wall Street Examiner", "title": "The Scary Inefficiency & Environmental Costs of Bitcoin", "title_full": "The Scary Inefficiency & Environmental Costs of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-19T19:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wallstreetexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gr1_lrg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27044b0a5554ede41395b78c8657fa4b0968a095", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4lCSzNBgW1_2ueF7WCwUXV3sqWsH.gMr9p1Xz8ZixrQQmJSXqPj.HMzeiH9qrwoYwU2r3.WBYrC44mCzSJ3eoiFuMLI.77rzD_q8Ip3PlVtG8AiC3ROfV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Constantin Gurdgiev", "published": "2018-05-19T19:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Scary Inefficiency & Environmental Costs of Bitcoin", "text": "May 19, True Economics\nBitcoin is just one of the cryptocurrencies, albeit the dominant one by market capitalisation and mining assets deployment.

He also spoke about his past investing in Bitcoin and his opinion for its future.\nThe index was created in a partnership between Bloomberg and Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP. The index aims to provide benchmarking of cryptocurrency assets for investors to use in a transparent fashion. It is currently comprised of the top 10 currencies by the overall market cap, even though Novogratz clarified that other currencies might be included based on liquidity and the overall state of the market.\nNovogratz spoke about how he brought Bitcoin when it was $96. He said that he “sold a lot along the way” and that the retail bubble popped in January, leading to a 75% correction when Bitcoin was around $19000 and Ethereum around $1300. He said:\n“The whole crypto revolution comes out of a breadown in trust in institutions.”\nHe explained how the aftermath of the recession caused the explosion of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Post the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as a hope for so-called cypherpunks, as Satoshi’s whitepaper was released around this time. Novogratz says they felt like “this is an alternative”. He went on to say:\n“The token mechanism is very cool. We don’t need to trust the center, we need to trust the network, the cryptology and the computer science.”\nHe spoke about the adoption of blockchain by corporates, giving an example of Microsoft’s system. He said:\n“It would be shocking if every corporate treasury in 5-10 years doesn’t have a blockchain treasury. You’re cutting out lots of people and you’re cutting out a lot of mistakes.”\nWhen asked about whether Bitcoin will reach the highs seen in January of this year, Novogratz said that he believed that it would. He said that it depended on the custody solutions for these digital assets, namely wallet services and private key storage solutions. He stated that until institutional names come into the market as custodians, Bitcoin would not reach its previous highs. He said:\n“Sometime within the next 3-12 months big announcements will happen saying we’ll custody this stuff.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "micheal novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "micheal novogratz bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "micha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management lp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox business", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T22:58:35.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e99404ded3ca6446b4beb024e1a80ab5cab294f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlPQ7scAaeHR93RWckHg3Iad7GuDrt6478BkV7OwL2uujSNjZpHqX5jO0hPXLSrzgl.6Xf82nmee1bwYNP4.i8_LoGPUwB.bgikj3d0ODSGsxfZXKenfDdQSBhzKYfDPObcut49N90Medpfh7l2EmbidL826vlAM1RwfOaS8GNGkizRNey9Jbk6", "site_full": "renewablesnaps.com", "site": "renewablesnaps.com", "site_section": "http://renewablesnaps.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Renewable Snaps", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "published": "2018-05-19T18:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e99404ded3ca6446b4beb024e1a80ab5cab294f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlPQ7scAaeHR93RWckHg3Iad7GuDrt6478BkV7OwL2uujSNjZpHqX5jO0hPXLSrzgl.6Xf82nmee1bwYNP4.i8_LoGPUwB.bgikj3d0ODSGsxfZXKenfDdQSBhzKYfDPObcut49N90Medpfh7l2EmbidL826vlAM1RwfOaS8GNGkizRNey9Jbk6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-19T18:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "text": "The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is launching this year a crypto-funded initiative to power a university in Moldova with solar energy.

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his \"rat poison\" view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week's Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here .\nFred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn't Get Bitcoin In his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as \"rat poison.\" Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett's approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works.\nCivic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they're of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the \"world's first crypto beer vending machine.\"\nDigital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution Los Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities.\nSocial Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S. eToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year.\nBitmain Leads Circle's $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin Bitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week.\nThey are also joining forces to create a \"stablecoin,\" a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin ( USDC ), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://netki.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/digital-identity-company-netki-launches-investor-validation-solution/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/social-cryptocurrency-trading-and-brokerage-firm-etoro-expanding-us/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-leads-circles-100-million-round-teams-create-stable-coin/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/civic-demos-proof-concept-beer-vending-machines-launches-id-codes/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://www.civic.com/", "https://blog.circle.com/2018/05/15/circle-announces-usd-coin-bitmain-partnership-and-new-strategic-financing/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fred-wilson-explains-why-warren-buffett-doesnt-get-bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle torpey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T18:51:09.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc978611147167ee05af1f56507b8906f36de83e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHIG9SGYlGUebnsSrQk0euZp5m.LM1WIhjoE4lL2d9Q394L_rV_JBqIuWwuJJNW_nTA-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – China Has Found 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "Bitcoin – China Has Found 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies", "published": "2018-05-19T18:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-China-Has-Found-421-Fake-Cryptocurrencies.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc978611147167ee05af1f56507b8906f36de83e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHIG9SGYlGUebnsSrQk0euZp5m.LM1WIhjoE4lL2d9Q394L_rV_JBqIuWwuJJNW_nTA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-19T18:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – China Has Found 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies", "text": "Bitcoin – China Has Found 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies 19 May 2018 8542\nA Chinese government-backed industry organization has published a report on fake cryptocurrencies. As of April, its monitoring platform has found 421 fake cryptocurrencies, 60% of which are deployed overseas. The Committee has also outlined major red flags of these cryptocurrencies.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies\nThe National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT), a Chinese government-backed industry organization, published the results of its analysis on fake cryptocurrencies on Friday.\nCiting that “In recent years, virtual currencies represented by bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, etc. have received continuous attention,” IFCERT pointed out that “some criminals are engaged in financial fraud or pyramid schemes under the cover of virtual currency.” The Committee added that fake cryptocurrencies frequently appear, “causing investors to suffer major losses.”\nIFCERT’s National Internet Financial Risk Analysis Technology Platform continuously monitors fake cryptos, the Committee detailed, elaborating:\nAs of April 2018, the technology platform has found 421 fake virtual currencies, of which more than 60% of fake virtual currency website servers are deployed overseas. Such platforms are difficult to find and difficult to track. The Red Flags\nThe Committee outlined some major red flags of these fake cryptocurrencies. Firstly, they adopt “pyramid-based” business models, claiming that their cryptocurrencies will generate high returns.\nSecondly, they have no real code, IFCERT described, noting that they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one.\nThirdly, they will not be traded on legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges, “so they often trade on over-the-counter or proprietary exchanges,” the report detailed, adding that:\nThere is a phenomenon that prices [on these platforms] are highly controlled by institutions or individuals, which tends to cause the illusion of rapid price increase. However, users often cannot conduct transactions or withdraw cash.\nIFCERT emphasized that fake cryptocurrencies have no value and are illegal, asserting that “Many of these platforms do not have business premises and business information, and servers are often deployed overseas,” so it will be difficult to recoup any losses for victims. 271 Fake ICOs\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal independently published its finding after a review of documents produced for 1,450 initial coin offerings (ICOs). The publication “has found 271 with red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.”\nInvestors have poured more than $1 billion into these 271 ICOs, the publication detailed, adding that “some of the firms are still raising funds, while others have shut down.

With all these new mining facilities popping up, cryptocurrency mining’s energy usage has also reached new heights. An energy research company based in the UK found that in the year 2017, the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin surpassed the annual energy usage of some 159 countries. Moreover, the energy spent globally on Bitcoin mining exceeded the electricity consumption of Ireland and most African nations. Issues that Bitcoin Miners are Facing There are serious problems as far as proof-of-work mining is concerned. 👓 View full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.onenewspage.com/n/Markets/1zj7zf096q/The-Problems-with-Bitcoin-and-Cryptocurrency-Mining.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T21:29:36.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80e62469f9264f839917cab6b3f8e5e81e2a0fb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY1SZqimAnpc3zfsvOs3sjoUr0tYID3gbpldfBptWbsYdbN52PxjWFW8Wp.mawh3Qrw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "This Week’s Major Planetary Shift Has Astrology-Believers Buying Bitcoin", "title_full": "This Week’s Major Planetary Shift Has Astrology-Believers Buying Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-19T17:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80e62469f9264f839917cab6b3f8e5e81e2a0fb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY1SZqimAnpc3zfsvOs3sjoUr0tYID3gbpldfBptWbsYdbN52PxjWFW8Wp.mawh3Qrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-19T17:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week’s Major Planetary Shift Has Astrology-Believers Buying Bitcoin", "text": "Call it \"baloney,\" \"pseudoscience,\" or a \"mass cultural delusion,\" there is no denying the fact that people believe in astrology. In fact, a 2009 Harris Poll revealed that 26 percent of Americans believe the stars control destiny. Now, it appears people are basing their decision to buy bitcoin on their horoscope.\nPlanetary Movements Affect Bitcoin For the sake of this article, no attempt will be made to wade into the debate of whether astrology is a science. According to experts in the field, there is an imminent shift in planetary positions. Uranus is moving from Aries to Taurus.\nThe planet Uranus symbolizes change and revolution leading believers to predict a coming paradigm shift. With Taurus being an earth sign, this impending changing of the guard should affect finance, agriculture, climate, etc.\nThese days, cryptocurrency and bitcoin, in particular, is a significant topic in the financial realm. Thus, some astrologers posit that the number one crypto is about to revolutionize the financial market. With this in mind, true believers are buying bitcoin in the expectation of another bull run. To spice things a little, the symbol for Taurus is the head of a bull with horns. As far as symbolic representations go, this might appear profound.\nA Growing Trend The nascent nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to make predictions based on an established pattern. Thus, investors, many of whom are novices are left with confusing charts, \"expert advice,\" and now it seems horoscope. Proponents of astrology point to the correlation between previous planetary movements and several sweeping changes that occurred over the years.\nFor example, the last Uranus shift which brought into Aries saw the rise of social movements all over the world. Aries represents activism and individuality, and in the previous seven years, the world has seen the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and many social justice movements, coincidence? Uranus shifts every seven years, and the next shift occurs this week.\nRecently, former NFL star, Ricky Williams revealed that astrology played a big part in his investment decisions. He also said that he is investing in bitcoin because Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.\nWilliams isn't the only one, Marcus Thomas, a bitcoin trader based in Chicago told MarketWatch that he is investing in bitcoin for the same reason. According to financial analyst, Raymond Merriman, there is a correlation between planetary cycles and human activity.\nDo you believe astrology has any bearing on the price of bitcoin? Will you be investing in bitcoin when Uranus enters Taurus?

why this is true, there are two key pieces of information that a person must have: The first is an understanding of how money actually works: how it is created, how it enters the marketplace, and what exactly makes it valuable. The second is an understanding of the Bitcoin community and system.\nThe short answer is that Bitcoin does everything you'd like a currency to do, and it doesn't have any of the drawbacks associated with any of the other currencies available.\nIt is amazing acceptable as a currency to every honest and rational person who also really understands money, and it is a magnificent protest against everything that is wrong with politics, wall street, the global central banking system, and our grossly manipulated economy.\nOh, you want more details? Great! Here's a great explanation in 104 seconds: http://www.weusecoins.com/\nYou want even more? That AWESOME TOO!\nThe below is a bit meater, but it's important information to understand the real problems that Bitcoin solves.\nEvery currency has it's own rules for it's creation. Some currencies are made out of a precious commodity that is inherently valuable (like gold and silver coins, or in the past: shells and jewelry), some currencies are paper for easy exchange but backed by a commodity (like gold or silver certificates), but most modern currencies are simply paper that is printed by a private central bank empowered to print a nations currency by that country's government.\nModern currencies enter the marketplace by being lent out through a series of banks that charge interest. The country's central bank prints the money and lends that money out to the big banks in the country at the \"discount window\" interest rate; these banks then lend out the money on consumer loans through their branch banks.\nThis system ensures that there is never enough money for all the people to pay off their debts. It ensures that there are always people who will be motivated to work for money. This system also allows the banking industry to basically control when there will be massive defaults and foreclosures. Defaults and foreclosures are built into the system itself. A quick visual example to demonstrate this: imagine if there was no money in a country of 2000 people, then half the people in this country all borrowed $1000 from their chosen bank, injecting $1M worth of currency into the country, and these individuals who received loans all agreed to pay back $1100 a year later (the loan plus $100 interest). The banks are going to get a vast amount of that money paid back to them, and the people who aren't as good at getting money will lose their assets which the banks will seize through foreclosure. The banks themselves did nothing to create value, they did not put up the money themselves, they borrowed it from the central bank, and they sold the FHA compliant mortgage to a federally insured government sponsored enterprise like fannie-mae or freddie-mac, which get bailed out at tax payer expense... so the banks don't really have to deal with foreclosed properties either. The foreclosed properties end up going to HUD, and someone else will take out another loan to buy them.\nThis system works incredibly well for the banking industry, they get to collect interest and seize properties without having put up any capital themselves; their loses are pushed onto the tax-payers through bailouts; and their profits accrue to shareholders.\nPoliticians accept this mostly because they don't understand it, or if they do, they have positioned themselves to benefit from it.\nThis system provides those in the government (and those with connections to the government) with easy access to new money; The Federal Reserve, a private company, with private and secret shareholders, is empowered by the federal government to be the sole printer of Federal Reserve Notes (US Dollars), and in exchange, the Federal Reserve MUST purchase any treasury bonds that the US Treasury requires it to purchase. This arrangement means that the US federal government may issue an unlimited number of US Treasury Bonds without fear of ever not having a buyer for them.\nThe four reasons that US Dollars (Federal Reserve Notes) are considered valuable are:\nUS Citizens are forced (under penalty of asset seizure and imprisonment) to pay taxes using US Dollars\nEVERY US Dollar currently in existence (and many more that are not in existence) are owed as debts to banks who were able to create loans as the vehicle for injecting money into the economy. (Thus fear of asset seizure [foreclosure] drives debtors to get US Dollars to pay off their debts).\nThe US Court System has established that Federal Reserve Notes are \"Legal Tender for All Debts Public and Private\", this means that all penalties and fees imposed by any government body in the US must be denominated in US Dollars, and any debt may be discharged in US dollars. (This means a contract that was originally between two people and said that Bob would pay Jean one ounce of 0.9999 gold, if Bob fails to pay and Jean takes him to court, the court will assert that Bob owes Jean a debt, and the amount will be denominated in US Dollars, and Bob will be able to discharge his debt to Jean in US dollars. This is the meaning of \"Legal Tender for All Debts Public and Private\") AND FINALLY\nOther countries are forced (under OPEC rules) to use US Dollars for making exchanges of oil; this dramatically strengthens the international demand for US Dollars.\nThe basic reason US Dollars are valued is because the people agree to these rules. Debtors cannot simply walk away from their debts (though now, more than ever, people are); Tax Payers cannot pay their taxes with any other currency; and individuals who are found liable in a lawsuit are required to pay in US Dollars. All of these actions fundamentally introduce the use of real or threatened police force against anyone who does not deal with Federal Reserve Notes in the US (and similar laws exist in other countries).\nAdditional information how how force and covert aggression are used against countries that resist participation in the Global Banking System, you might consider reading: Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\nThe bottom line is that most modern currencies are injected into society only with the creation of debt, and then the government uses threat of asset seizure and imprisonment and taxation and fines/fees to ensure that the currency is accepted.\nBitcoin is a purely electronic currency. It is created using very precisely controlled and agreed upon algorithms that are open source and totally transparent. No one is forced to use it, and it is not based on debt.\nIt is valuable precisely because rational and honest people don't want to manipulate, control, and enslave debtors. Bitcoin is the ultimate economic self-defense against dishonest individuals who have found their way into leadership positions within the banking industry, individuals who have positioned themselves as the Gods of Money, and who seek to use violence and threat of asset seizure against individuals who have had difficulty earning sufficient money to pay their debts (debts largely entered into as a pledge on the part of the debtor, and for which the creditor did little more than authorize an electronic funds transfer).\nBitcoin is fast, global, secure, largely anonymous, and less expensive than nearly any other transaction processing services (compare rates with credit card merchant services, paypal merchant services, and the many other bank fees associated with having an account).\nBitcoin is valuable because the community of users all agree that it is valuable. And every person who uses Bitcoin, who recognizes the value of this idea, strengthens the value of the currency. It is an idea whose time has come.\nCreate a Wallet, let people know that you accept Bitcoin. Learn more about Bitcoin. Consider purchasing Bitcoin on an exchange market. Consider operating a Miner. Buy something with Bitcoin. Help others discover Bitcoin as well.\nBitcoin is a perfect opportunity to help educate others about the realities of Money.\nContinue your own education.\nAn excellent documentary that presents the almost unbelievable and borderline terrifying history of money is \"The Money Masters\" ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXb-LrVkuwM )\nWe are a community of individuals who are honest, strong, and fully grounded in reality.\nYou are invited and welcome to participate in the paradigm shift and the revolution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXb-LrVkuwM", "http://www.weusecoins.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "positive"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T07:12:19.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e20467de57186e6c72de3d9947c9d99ec480742", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRZtnDtRrmxoDMR3Yd1_dwE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "why do you take payments in bitcoins?", "title_full": "why do you take payments in bitcoins?", "published": "2018-05-19T17:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.11, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e20467de57186e6c72de3d9947c9d99ec480742", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRZtnDtRrmxoDMR3Yd1_dwE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wiliam heil", "published": "2018-05-19T17:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "why do you take payments in bitcoins?", "text": "Quote: from: verifyas on November 10, 2017, 07:07:05 AM What makes you accept bitcoins for you items? or why do you sell in bitcoins?\nBecause we need money for live and if i am a trader, i should sell it for money i can use.

The exchange already supports trading pairs for ether and bitcoin. Gemini has also been approved to list bitcoin cash and litecoin, but it has not said when these cryptocurrencies will be added. Postive Outlook\nThe New York department’s approval bodes well for zcash, as the state is considered by many to be one of the strictest regulatory bodies in the U.S. Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini CEO, said zcash brings the strength of its privacy, an advantage that bitcoin lacks. Zcash Price Chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\nThe zcash price jumped from $248.22 to $381.43 from May 13 to 15. After dipping to $308.47 on May 17, the price was back to $377.56 the next day with a market cap of just under $1.5 billion,and was back down to $355.65 today. The cryptocurrency has seen $181 million in volume in the last 24 hours.\nThat said, the zcash price remains well below the all-time high of $876.31 it reached on Jan. 7, which gave it a $2.635 billion market cap. The price then tumbled to $187.78 by April 8 before mounting a recovery to its current price.\nAlso read: Winklevoss-led Gemini becomes ‘world’s first licensed Zcash exchange’ A Standout Performance\nZcash’s performance stood out among altcoins for the past week, as the cryptocurrency market lost more than $42 billion in a three-day period. On May 18, bitcoin fell below the $8,000 mark for the first time since the middle of April.\nBrian Kelly, BKCM founder and CNBC Fast Trader contributor, said the market did not reflect the positive news that Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange acknowledged they would create cryptocurrency platforms to allow clients to invest in cryptocurrency.\nFeatured Image

Try to schedule appointments with clients properly and let them know the kind of situation youre into and always do a good job. But if you cant be a freelancer then you can get into signature campaign like most of these community members do, I believe thats the easiest way to make money from Bitcoin.

In fact, a 2009 Harris Poll revealed that 26 percent of Americans believe the stars control destiny. Now, it appears people are basing their decision to buy bitcoin on their horoscope.\nPlanetary Movements Affect Bitcoin For the sake of this article, no attempt will be made to wade into the debate of whether astrology is a science. According to experts in the field, there is an imminent shift in planetary positions. Uranus is moving from Aries to Taurus.\nThe planet Uranus symbolizes change and revolution leading believers to predict a coming paradigm shift. With Taurus being an earth sign, this impending changing of the guard should affect finance, agriculture, climate, etc.\nThese days, cryptocurrency and bitcoin, in particular, is a significant topic in the financial realm. Thus, some astrologers posit that the number one crypto is about to revolutionize the financial market. With this in mind, true believers are buying bitcoin in the expectation of another bull run. To spice things a little, the symbol for Taurus is the head of a bull with horns. As far as symbolic representations go, this might appear profound.\nA Growing Trend The nascent nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to make predictions based on an established pattern. Thus, investors, many of whom are novices are left with confusing charts, “expert advice,” and now it seems horoscope. Proponents of astrology point to the correlation between previous planetary movements and several sweeping changes that occurred over the years.\nFor example, the last Uranus shift which brought into Aries saw the rise of social movements all over the world. Aries represents activism and individuality, and in the previous seven years, the world has seen the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and many social justice movements, coincidence? Uranus shifts every seven years, and the next shift occurs this week.\nRecently, former NFL star, Ricky Williams revealed that astrology played a big part in his investment decisions. He also said that he is investing in bitcoin because Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.\nWilliams isn’t the only one, Marcus Thomas, a bitcoin trader based in Chicago told MarketWatch that he is investing in bitcoin for the same reason. According to financial analyst, Raymond Merriman, there is a correlation between planetary cycles and human activity.\nDo you believe astrology has any bearing on the price of bitcoin? Will you be investing in bitcoin when Uranus enters Taurus?

In fact, a 2009 Harris Poll revealed that 26 percent of Americans believe the stars control destiny. Now, it appears people are basing their decision to buy bitcoin on their horoscope. Planetary Movements Affect Bitcoin\nFor the sake of this article, no attempt will be made to wade into the debate of whether astrology is a science. According to experts in the field, there is an imminent shift in planetary positions. Uranus is moving from Aries to Taurus.\nThe planet Uranus symbolizes change and revolution leading believers to predict a coming paradigm shift. With Taurus being an earth sign, this impending changing of the guard should affect finance, agriculture, climate, etc.\nThese days, cryptocurrency and bitcoin, in particular, is a significant topic in the financial realm. Thus, some astrologers posit that the number one crypto is about to revolutionize the financial market. With this in mind, true believers are buying bitcoin in the expectation of another bull run. To spice things a little, the symbol for Taurus is the head of a bull with horns. As far as symbolic representations go, this might appear profound. A Growing Trend\nThe nascent nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to make predictions based on an established pattern. Thus, investors, many of whom are novices are left with confusing charts, “expert advice,” and now it seems horoscope. Proponents of astrology point to the correlation between previous planetary movements and several sweeping changes that occurred over the years.\nFor example, the last Uranus shift which brought into Aries saw the rise of social movements all over the world. Aries represents activism and individuality, and in the previous seven years, the world has seen the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and many social justice movements, coincidence? Uranus shifts every seven years, and the next shift occurs this week.\nRecently, former NFL star, Ricky Williams revealed that astrology played a big part in his investment decisions. He also said that he is investing in bitcoin because Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.\nWilliams isn’t the only one, Marcus Thomas, a bitcoin trader based in Chicago told MarketWatch that he is investing in bitcoin for the same reason. According to financial analyst, Raymond Merriman, there is a correlation between planetary cycles and human activity.\nDo you believe astrology has any bearing on the price of bitcoin? Will you be investing in bitcoin when Uranus enters Taurus?

This section highlights a few options for acquiring Bitcoins that are relatively private, or at least not overwhelmingly invasive.\nTo increase your privacy, do not carry devices with you that have SIM cards in them, and never log your location with GPS. You can buy bitcoins in person at Bitcoin meetups, through the “marketplace” option of the Mycelium wallet (the marketplace exists on the Android version only), or by finding traders on the LocalBitcoins platform.\nThe best place to meet traders in person is in a busy but not crowded place that offers free Wi-Fi. Public libraries or cafes are great venues for these appointments.\nBoth parties should allow enough time to wait for at least one confirmation of the Bitcoin transaction. To make sure your Bitcoin transaction gets confirmed by the network, you don’t need to bring a Bitcoin wallet with you; just knowing your address is enough.\nEnter the address into the search field on Blockcypher or any other blockchain explorer and watch as the transaction comes in and confirms. Bitcoin ATMs are common in some countries but rare in others. Check Coin ATM Radar to see if there’s one near you!

By trial and error, it has shown us that digital money are the present rather than the future of finance. So, this is the main point of why Bitcoin is different than other cryptocurrencies. It will always remain the King of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin will be the most sure investment when it comes to cryptocurrency. The key part of such success is popularity and trust (gained due to the fact that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency).

However, some Dutch students finishing studying may hate it right now, as they were given an unordinary topic for an examination this year - bitcoin technology. “Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It exists since January 1, 2009, and can be used to pay at online stores or for other online services. Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank, unlike normal money. Instead, Bitcoin is created by letting computers work on solutions for selected mathematical problems. It works like this: anyone can run special software on his or her computer to contribute to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that finds the solution to a problem receives 25 BTC (newly mined) as a reward. Because in 2014, such a problem was solved every 10 minutes, 25 BTC were put into circulation every 10 minutes.”\nThe description stated above was given to the students at the exam . They needed to answer five questions, which were shaped as mathematical problems but with one exception - they were based on bitcoin tech.\nAll the questions were related to one of the aspects of blockchain-based digital currency. For example, students had to calculate the year by which the reward for miners will be less than a bitcoin or define the maximum amounts of virtual coins that can be in circulation.\nIf you are willing to try your hand, the original paperwork was put here .

Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here .\nFred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin In his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works.\nCivic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”\nDigital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution Los Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities.\nSocial Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S. eToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nRead Article Full Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Blockchain’s Big Gathering : https://ift.tt/2IwiGq6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle torpey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:57:31.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e524b3528a3295bf48901d67b2aef44fee705b3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQV3MeuF3xtlwpONLrfaMJY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Can we take legal action against Bitcoin cheaters..", "title_full": "Can we take legal action against Bitcoin cheaters..", "published": "2018-05-19T16:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e524b3528a3295bf48901d67b2aef44fee705b3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQV3MeuF3xtlwpONLrfaMJY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Streamlink", "published": "2018-05-19T16:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can we take legal action against Bitcoin cheaters..", "text": "Quote: from: henmark on May 16, 2018, 09:42:41 AM Quote: from: Rizky Aditya on May 14, 2018, 10:26:05 AM Quote: from: Daimon88 on May 09, 2018, 07:19:31 AM Quote: from: SellBuyAcc on May 06, 2018, 01:33:55 PM We can but is really really hard to figure it out that is why even the government did not like the bitcoin due to its feature of untrackable transaction which mostly used in crime transaction.\nNow bitcoin transaction is traceable and if government wants he can take legal actions against cheaters. Now it is not easy to use bitcoin for illegal activities and crimes in those countries who legalized bitcoin. The problem is still there in many countries but I am sure that it will be overcome in the near future. The controllers should take actions in this regard.\nThere are few cases in my country which has been traced and the culprits have been arrested. It means that governments can control illegal activities in bitcoin. The problem is that there is no proof who holds bitcoin and how much. Mostly bitcoin is used for crimes and for illegal activities. Every country should keep the record of such people so illegal use of bitcoin can be stopped.\nAll the transactions which we perform in the world of the crypto currencies are anonymous which makes it quite harder for anyone to trace the person whom you are dealing with and that because of which, you can never find the person who has cheated you. Even if you find that person, the local laws of your country are not that much well established and that they cant help you out in it.\nYou can only catch the cheater of you somehow managed to keep the track of all the records if the transactions and that if you are this much skillful that you exactly know what has happened to you. there is a cybercrime law which can help you in taking any kind of legal action against the cheaters but for that you need to have some solid proof against that person so that strict actions can be taken.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T12:57:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cdb4429e32e2c3b40fb6c03b8edf7dd6928da163", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIiehC1SGQoKlI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "published": "2018-05-19T16:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cdb4429e32e2c3b40fb6c03b8edf7dd6928da163", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIiehC1SGQoKlI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jeluhtajem", "published": "2018-05-19T16:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "text": "better bitcoin investments than any other investment.

Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes\nBlockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.” Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution\nLos Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform.

The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now.
