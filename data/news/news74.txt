Seriously, for the first 5-8 years, the digital currency was mainly used as a means for criminals to launder money and sell illegal goods on the dark market. Think of all the massive hacks in the early days also, and all those darknet markets that disappeared with huge amounts of bitcoin.\nLiterally millions and millions of the 16 million coins out there would be owned by criminals. And now with bitcoin becoming more centralized and less anonymous, they are swiftly exiting the market and looking for alternative dark coins.\nI also personally avoid using bitcoin all-together because of the extremely slow transaction speeds and high cost's associated with it.\nThe bitcoin mining business is dust, so that interest will die quickly.\nI just don't see a very bright future for the god of cryptocurrency and it will surely be surpassed by one of its rivals soon enough.\nI'm torn between predicting it to be Dash, or Ethereum, and I recon it could be about 2 years before that happens.\nWould love to know peoples thoughts on the future of bitcoin.\nWhere will bitcoin be in\n2 weeks?\n2 months?\n2 years?\nWill it be surpassed by another coin? If so, which one and when?\nWe don't actually know that for sure.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 55.9506. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a buy 0 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 40.03. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 43 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -54. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 14 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed up 207.694 at 7,549.863.

My own teams in the past have forked the Bitcoin code.\"\nHe points out it would be impossible for exchanges to support all Bitcoin forks but when a fork garners enough community support and market value, certain platforms will start supporting these forks too.\n\"But it is a complex process that comes with its dangers and isn't straight forward. Without getting into the detail, concepts such as replay attacks are sometimes difficult to manage and can risk the value on the original chain.\n\"Ultimately, if you want to have control of which forks you want to support, you should personally be in control of your own private keys and not leave your crypto-currencies on an exchange or with a third-party wallet.\"\nFor Richard de Sousa, partner at SA-based crypto-currency exchange AltcoinTrader , some forks are more profitable than others depending on how valid the coin is and the team behind the fork.\nHe notes investors have made a lot of money, provided their coins have been in an exchange that supports the fork, or if they have held their own private keys.\nAccording to De Sousa, very often a Bitcoin fork will die out because of lack of support and a team that can run the fork.\n\"Anyone without permission can fork Bitcoin. Only when there is a strong movement behind it, will the fork have some value and go onto exchanges.\"\nHe adds that whether exchanges are reaping the rewards or not, they are keeping the coins and certainly have custody of the coins.\n\"Bitcoin Gold and many of the smaller forks may not be as well positioned as Bitcoin Cash, but this is considered a main fork. Exchanges might not support every single fork, as some forks are risky, but they still receive the coins.\n\"It is their discretion to decide whether they want to give their clients and they chose not to. We can be led by industry standards of what most credible exchanges are doing and most credible exchanges did support Bitcoin Gold.\nAltcoinTrader, apart from supporting Bitcoin Gold, gave Bitcoin Private users on its platform on 18 April as the third Bitcoin forked coin.\n\"First prize is to hold your own private keys of your wallet so you would benefit from all the forks and second prize is definitely to use credible exchanges.\" Unanimous decision\nCarel de Jager, consultant at the Blockchain Academy , notes that sometimes the protocol needs to be upgraded, a bug needs to be fixed, or (controversially) a transaction in the ledger needs to be reversed.\n\"If such a decision is not completely unanimous between all of the nodes, it results in a contentious hard fork. When this happens, the blockchain splits in two and a new crypto-currency is created.\"\nHe adds that forks can be profitable to investors, especially if there is a high demand for the newly-created coin.\n\"The demand tends to be strongly correlated to exchanges' decision to list the new coins, and this in turn is dependent on the coin security features, development team and community interaction. In some instances, a strong use case for the new coin can also drive demand. Bitcoin Cash, for example, allows for cheap transactions through increasing the block size.\"\nAccording to De Jager, the code behind Bitcoin Cash is also secure, especially with regards to replay protection. Bitcoin Gold, on the other hand, has a much smaller community working on the project and there are doubts about how secure the code is.\n\"Different exchanges have different appetites for risk with forks. Luno is very risk-averse and would not list a fork if it is not 100% sure it is safe to do so. Some exchanges are less concerned and would be more willing to list a fork. Each exchange has its own criteria with which they review a coin's security.\n\"Before a fork occurs, you as an investor should make sure you own your private keys if you wish to claim the forked coins. And then you should wait a few days after the fork before you claim and start doing transactions since there will always be risks of replay and 51% attacks immediately after a fork.

A person cannot survive without both of them. Education is as important as money. However, if a person has to make a tough choice, I advise him to go for knowledge.

Bitcoin price short-term target on the upside is at $7,600 which is a breakout position towards $7,700.\nThe week’s trading is coming to an end and it seems Bitcoin will close the trading on June 1 below $7,600. There is a bullish momentum in progress but the upside is being limited by the upper trendline of the contracting triangle pattern. The trendline also coincides with the 38.2% Fib retracement level with previous swing high of $7,907 and a low of $7,090.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been one of the crypto-progressive financial institutions lately. The Director of Monetary and Capital Markets Department, Dong He, in his latest report wrote in plain sight about the skepticism of the central banks across the world towards digital assets. He believes that the monopolistic nature of central banks was the catalyst for the creation of Bitcoin. Moreover, Mr. He says that central banks will in future become obsolete institutions due to virtual currencies. A section of Dong He report reads:\n“Central banks should continue to make their money attractive for use as a settlement vehicle. For example, they could make central bank money user-friendly in the digital world by issuing digital tokens of their own to supplement physical cash and bank reserves. Such central bank digital currency could be exchanged, peer to peer in a decentralized manner, much as crypto assets are.”\nBitcoin price , on the other hand, is trading at $7,558 at the time of writing and is battling to overcome the short-term resistance at $7,560. The 50 SMA is providing immediate support, besides, the contracting triangle is supported at the 50% Fib retracement level. The short-term target on the upside is at $7,600 which is a breakout position towards $7,700. On the flip side, if the support zones above fail to hold the price, the 200 SMA presents a demand zone slightly above $7,400, however, $7,300 is still within reach.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dong he", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "monetary and capital markets department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T15:24:56.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13f476103a40ae6304d52c5b7d14a1bdc8e7beb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBFi1ZfDM2LHvCAbxCtfdwywrVtIpO4H0yWkKdYDZbrSBRi4uCAIk4SwOrdAQTjlR4CUhhF4hYe6q334mmnTlCTExX7VnQBoM-", "site_full": "legenta.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://legenta.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Legenta", "title": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group", "title_full": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group", "published": "2018-06-01T14:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13f476103a40ae6304d52c5b7d14a1bdc8e7beb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBFi1ZfDM2LHvCAbxCtfdwywrVtIpO4H0yWkKdYDZbrSBRi4uCAIk4SwOrdAQTjlR4CUhhF4hYe6q334mmnTlCTExX7VnQBoM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Legenta (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T14:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group", "text": "In a delightful bit of irony BitBay , a Central European exchange, has shut down operations in Poland even as it received an invitation by the Polish government to participate in a national blockchain working group.

Are there any other coins in the Komodo ecosystem (besides KMD) that are useful?\nCheck this documentation\nhttps://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/302940161/DEX+compensation+distribution .\nThanks!\nSo, if a person holds these asset coins in their Agama wallet, will the rewards be automatically added to their KMD balance?\nWould the rewards for 1 DEX coin look like this?: (# of KMD traded on BarterDEX) x (0.15% x 50%) / (# of total DEX coins)\nWhat is the total supply of DEX coins?\nThere aren't any in Barterdex for sale...\nThanks for your help\n- Yes the dividends will be paid to the KMD Address\n- Simply said yes. The DEX fee is 1/777 of relvolume so if you buy DEX for KMD (DEX/KMD pair) you pay 1/777 KMD approx 0.15% as a fee this fee is distributed 50% to DEX holders\n- The total supply is 1'000'000 DEX Coins\n- There are sometimes a few up for grabs https://dexstats.info/gui/index.php?base=DEX&rel=KMD\nAlso there are some people willing to sell for a particular price join the slack in #trading and ask", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dexstats.info/gui/index.php?base=DEX&rel=KMD", "https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/302940161/DEX+compensation+distribution"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T08:06:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4715a2a5337fe7abda8684579c015e7f9aae8d64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSB2GlQTz4B9UryP3oO42L4uBrqLKoAZ2r3gwlAj2XfptHq_RyI_mwuHM9oLX7cgPaa32RPi2WoTv1CU10Oza_oMjYTMyFaMpUrTGnaSkXTEop6JgXMz.00smcDuSuhEWEWJrQ1M5964VydJNlBWmkF0TRO9NA6aIUG7dzL_U0ruA--", "site_full": "lukecdotsmith.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://lukecdotsmith.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group – Luke Smith", "title": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group", "title_full": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group", "published": "2018-06-01T14:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4715a2a5337fe7abda8684579c015e7f9aae8d64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSB2GlQTz4B9UryP3oO42L4uBrqLKoAZ2r3gwlAj2XfptHq_RyI_mwuHM9oLX7cgPaa32RPi2WoTv1CU10Oza_oMjYTMyFaMpUrTGnaSkXTEop6JgXMz.00smcDuSuhEWEWJrQ1M5964VydJNlBWmkF0TRO9NA6aIUG7dzL_U0ruA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lukecdotsmith", "published": "2018-06-01T14:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin exchange abandons Poland even as the government invites it to a working group", "text": "In a delightful bit of irony BitBay , a Central European exchange, has shut down operations in Poland even as it received an invitation by the Polish government to participate in a national blockchain working group.

Unless it is Bitcoin?", "text": "global markets Bitcoin What goes up, must come down. Unless it is Bitcoin? Global markets fall and Bitcoin rises. Why? A pro-blockchain speech by Xi Jinping? The upcoming World Cup? Crazy price predictions? Does anybody know? By Richard Cook June 1, 2018 7:40 PM (UTC+8) Comment 0\nPolitical chaos in Italy and Spain. Global stock markets start tumbling. So Bitcoin starts rising? This week, Italy’s populist coalition, the anti-establishment Five Star party and the right-wing League, tussled with the country’s president over the formation of a government.\nIn Spain, the ruling party was found to have been involved in an illegal kickbacks scheme, which ultimately cost Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy his job. Many started to predict the beginning of the end for the EU and markets accordingly crashed across the world. Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox\nBut not in crypto.\nAt the start of the week, many observers, including indeed us at The Chain , predicted Bitcoin was going to continue its downward slide and the start of June would see it slip below the $7,000 milestone price point.\nThe pessimistic prediction was based on the back of news this week – that the US Department of Justice has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of digital currencies – and also last week’s news about North American securities regulators launching “Operation Crypto-sweep.”\nThe Crypto-sweep probe, by 40 different state- and provincial-level US and Canadian regulatory bodies, has already launched 70 investigations into alleged crypto-currency scams and fraudulent ICOs, and claims this is “just the tip of the iceberg.”\nOn May 29 Bitcoin dropped to $7,043 on US markets. As the political shenanigans in Italy reached crisis point on the 30th, it then suddenly rallied and has yo-yoed upwards every since and now sits at $7,600. So why did crypto jump when all other assets sank?\nSome have pointed to President Xi Jinping’s speech on Monday to the Chinese Academy of Sciences that said blockchain – alongside artificial intelligence, quantum computing, mobile communications and the Internet of Things – had the power to “reconstruct the global innovation map and reshape the global economic structure.”\nOthers said the price spike was because of the upcoming month-long FIFA World Cup tournament that kicks off in Russia on June 14. Because of the raft of international financial sanctions against Moscow, the many thousands of soccer fans traveling to the event from across the globe are purportedly preparing to spend Bitcoin instead of cash and this, supposedly, will prop up its price for the next few weeks.\nThe crypto hardcore, however, say the price rise is down to another prediction from the Machiavellian Bitcoin enthusiast and software entrepreneur John McAfee, who said on Wednesday that because “institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” the top 10 crypto tokens are about to “go through the roof fairly quickly.” McAfee said on June 30 that Bitcoin will be trading above $15,000 by June 12 and, hey presto, its price started moving up.\nAs ridiculous as it may seem, McAfee’s regular shoot-from-the-hip statements do often move the crypto markets. Which brings us on to another possible explanation.\nPeter Tchir, trader, crypto-commentator and Forbes columnist, argued last year that there are three rules of Bitcoin .\nRule one is “Bitcoin is Smarter Than Me.” Rule three is “The Sustainability of Bitcoin’s Advantages are Questionable.” And the middle rule? “There Are No Rules.” Which possibly is all we need to know.\nSo maybe this week’s spike rise was multiple Russian and Chinese billionaires piling back into Bitcoin as all the other markets sank? Or not? Maybe it’s to do with North Korea? And maybe it’s not. Time will tell.

The firm kicked off its own bitcoin mining operations in December 2017, and has also slated in August as the deadline for the launch of its cloud mining service.\nThe tech giant said in the announcement that the hope is to encourage the public to become familiar with cryptocurrencies via the new app, since users will need to use their own digital wallets to receive and use the bitcoin.\nGMO indicated that, moving forward, it may include support for more cryptocurrencies within the app and also expand its integrations across other mobile games.\nThe new service comes just a week after GMO announced that it is launching the world’s first 7nm bitcoin mining chip, with a target shipment deadline set for the end of October 2018.\nMobile game image via Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/thailand-roiet-may-22-2017-man-644895004?src=HkYmCCtRs5-loBG6t-6dew-1-20", "https://www.gmo.jp/en/news/article/?id=778"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gmo internet group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T15:45:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65e7eb016abb5ffe655ffc77551cfae28c4bc7b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tfz71zlLPX_ioWghFvvvsK8guWlDeDdj6wAiuBUMGn7RUXjcC7pPas9vXWPAgJEM6Tyoj6BuqHE7biuBkPCrrRb3PoI.LfGS7VHKwwuyCrV4.", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/news/feed/", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "News – CCN", "title": "No Bull Run in Sight, Investors Target Long-Term Bitcoin Price Rally", "title_full": "No Bull Run in Sight, Investors Target Long-Term Bitcoin Price Rally", "published": "2018-06-01T14:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-piggy-bank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65e7eb016abb5ffe655ffc77551cfae28c4bc7b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tfz71zlLPX_ioWghFvvvsK8guWlDeDdj6wAiuBUMGn7RUXjcC7pPas9vXWPAgJEM6Tyoj6BuqHE7biuBkPCrrRb3PoI.LfGS7VHKwwuyCrV4.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joseph Young", "published": "2018-06-01T14:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "No Bull Run in Sight, Investors Target Long-Term Bitcoin Price Rally", "text": "No Bull Run in Sight, Investors Target Long-Term Bitcoin Price Rally Advertisement Get exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe cryptocurrency market has struggled to make major movements on the upside, as major digital currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum have stabilized at $7,580 and $584 respectively. The valuation of the cryptocurrency market has slightly increased from $330 billion to $333 billion, by around 1 percent. Bitcoin’s Struggle\nExactly one week ago, on May 25, the price of bitcoin was $7,530. Today, as of June 1, the price of bitcoin is $7,580. Over the past seven days, BTC remained in the $7,300 to $7,500 range, struggling to record any major or minor movement on both the downside and upside.\nBased on the short-term price trend of BTC over the past week, it remains unlikely that BTC returns to previous support levels at $10,000 and $12,000, given that the 5-month and 10-month MA bear cross have been confirmed for the first time since 2014. More to that, BTC failed to swiftly rebound to the $8,000 mark over the past few days, eliminating the possibility of a potential corrective rally to $10,000 in the short-term.\nIf BTC can surpass the $8,500 mark in the next few days with a strong spike in volume, it is possible that BTC breaks its descending trendline since May 5, eyeing a mid-term recovery and a bounce back to the $10,000 region. However, without a strong recovery, it remains unlikely for bitcoin to initiate a bull run in the short-term.\nAri Paul, a prominent cryptocurrency investor and researcher, who co-founded the digital asset investment firm BlockTower, said:\n“I’ve had chats with some very savvy fund managers in the last few days, all of whom said, ‘I don’t see where the new money comes from any time soon,’” emphasizing that most investors agree in a medium to long-term adoption curve of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n“Institutional money started trickling into cryptocurrency in mid-2017, but it’s been slower than many expected. That doesn’t mean it’s not coming. There are a lot of pieces that need to come together, one big piece being third party custody,” Paul added.\nThe lack of stable custodian services and the strong downward trend of bitcoin all point toward a short-term bear market, but a strong mid to long-term trend for BTC. Large-Scale Investors are Extremely Bullish in Long-Term\nDan Morehead, the founder and CEO of leading cryptocurrency hedge fund Pantera Capital, stated that both the mid-term and long-term trend of bitcoin are optimistic, because the dominant cryptocurrency is losing its “skanky” image among institutional investors.\nMore importantly, in the long-term, Morehead noted that he envisions the cryptocurrency market growing to a $4 trillion asset class.\n“Bitcoin is a screaming buy right now,” said Morehead, who oversees more than $1 billion at Pantera Capital. He added that even a $40 trillion market valuation is possible for cryptocurrency, explaining “it’s the 10-year forecast. It’s not going to happen overnight.”\nWith stable custodian services and the entrance of institutional investors, in the mid-term, possibly by the end of 2018, BTC could enter a proper bull market. However, as of current, the short-term trend of BTC seems bearish.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1002380599284428802", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T15:57:38.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88745f9560308c1bc54694b0a76e692681cf847b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz7HV4tUW_EkqyIY.cchGnLw-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-01T14:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88745f9560308c1bc54694b0a76e692681cf847b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz7HV4tUW_EkqyIY.cchGnLw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T14:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 1, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Ownership: Your Private Keys to Financial Sovereignty Bitcoin News (press release) Every day someone new is learning about the fantastic benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency solutions.

The total is less than half the $1.4 trillion in more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies traded during the previous monthly period, 24/7 Wall St reports. The data shows a bearish May following a rather bullish April. With a 30-day volume of $184.31 billion, bitcoin (BTC) is the most traded cryptocurrency.\nThe last several months have seen another negative trend – in futures trading. Since March, the contracts have dropped by a third. Nymex bitcoin futures have lost more than 51% since trading began in January. Bitcoin June futures on Cboe traded down about 1.9% at noon on Wednesday. The expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25 also influenced cryptocurrency prices.\nCrypto Trade Booming in Bahrain In some parts of the world, however, things do not look so bleak. Since the beginning of this year, more jurisdictions have begun to legally recognize cryptocurrencies, one way or another. These include the US, Canada, many members of the European Union, and several African and Asian nations.\nBahrain , a country credited for building the first post-oil economy in the Persian Gulf, has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency, according to local media. In the absence of official regulations, bitcoin transactions have been booming on Bahraini websites and social media. A shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in the Riffa area, Albawaba Business reported.\nThe island nation has also indicated it may soon emerge as a global cryptocurrency exchange hub. In March, the government in Manama set up a “regulatory sandbox” for that purpose. “As long as the business qualifies as fintech, we will welcome it,” said Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, quoted by Business Line . At least four crypto trading platforms are already registered there.\nThe sector, however, is still awaiting a final decision on the legal tender status of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is supposed to come from the Central Bank of Bahrain, which is the country’s financial regulator.\nReal Estate Sold for Bitcoin in Georgia A luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins (~$190,000) in Georgia . According to local realtors, the owner has explicitly asked the price to be announced in cryptocurrency, Geomigrant reports. The current legislation does not mention crypto payments. Despite the lack of a regulatory framework, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a means of exchange and trade among Georgians.\nThe Caucasian country is known as a major crypto mining hub in Eurasia thanks to some tax incentives and low electricity rates. According to a recently published study by the World Bank, around 5% of Georgian households participate in cryptocurrency trading and investing. Blockchain technologies have also spread in Georgia.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

The major crypto exchange is thinking about opening an office in Uganda and we have covered the story in today’s Bitcoin in Brief. Also, online trade with cryptos spikes in Bahrain, while in Georgia, luxury real estate is being sold for bitcoin. All this has been happening in an otherwise bearish May. Binance to Open Office in Uganda\nBinance is considering the possibility of opening a new office in Uganda , company CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference 2018, which took place at the end of May in Kampala, the country’s capital. The move is part of the trading platform’s plans to support the economic transformation of the African nation and increase youth employment through blockchain technology implementation. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has offices in Japan, Hong Kong, Malta , and intends to establish a global compliance center in Bermuda .\nWith the help of companies like Binance, “Uganda will be able to join the 4th Industrial Revolution, subsequently a lot of new jobs will open and the flow of investment into the country will increase,” Zhao said. “Watching this conference I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” he stated.\nIn April, Binance’ CEO announced a partnership with Crypto Savannah, an African blockchain innovation hub, Msingi, an organization working to build the East African industries of the future, and the “Made in Africa” Initiative. In a post on Twitter, Changpeng Zhao promised “thousands of jobs and bringing investments to Uganda.” “Expect more news on Africa!” he added in the comments.\nIn a statement during the conference in Kampala, Zhao noted that most banks in Europe, the US, and China criticize cryptocurrencies and do everything possible to crush them, and added: “It seems to me that Africa has real chances of becoming one of the leading regions in the implementation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.” Bearish May Brings Down Trading Volumes\nMore than $606 billion in cryptocurrencies have been traded last month through over 1,600 different cryptocurrencies, according to Coinmarketcap . The total is less than half the $1.4 trillion in more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies traded during the previous monthly period, 24/7 Wall St reports. The data shows a bearish May following a rather bullish April. With a 30-day volume of $184.31 billion, bitcoin (BTC) is the most traded cryptocurrency.\nThe last several months have seen another negative trend – in futures trading. Since March, the contracts have dropped by a third. Nymex bitcoin futures have lost more than 51% since trading began in January. Bitcoin June futures on Cboe traded down about 1.9% at noon on Wednesday. The expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25 also influenced cryptocurrency prices. Crypto Trade Booming in Bahrain\nIn some parts of the world, however, things do not look so bleak. Since the beginning of this year, more jurisdictions have begun to legally recognize cryptocurrencies, one way or another. These include the US, Canada, many members of the European Union, and several African and Asian nations.\nBahrain , a country credited for building the first post-oil economy in the Persian Gulf, has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency, according to local media. In the absence of official regulations, bitcoin transactions have been booming on Bahraini websites and social media. A shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in the Riffa area, Albawaba Business reported.\nThe island nation has also indicated it may soon emerge as a global cryptocurrency exchange hub. In March, the government in Manama set up a “regulatory sandbox” for that purpose. “As long as the business qualifies as fintech, we will welcome it,” said Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, quoted by Business Line . At least four crypto trading platforms are already registered there.\nThe sector, however, is still awaiting a final decision on the legal tender status of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is supposed to come from the Central Bank of Bahrain, which is the country’s financial regulator. Real Estate Sold for Bitcoin in Georgia\nA luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins (~$190,000) in Georgia . According to local realtors, the owner has explicitly asked the price to be announced in cryptocurrency, Geomigrant reports. The current legislation does not mention crypto payments. Despite the lack of a regulatory framework, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a means of exchange and trade among Georgians.\nThe Caucasian country is known as a major crypto mining hub in Eurasia thanks to some tax incentives and low electricity rates. According to a recently published study by the World Bank, around 5% of Georgian households participate in cryptocurrency trading and investing. Blockchain technologies have also spread in Georgia.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

Tim Draper, the crypto millionaire and venture capitalist, told Forbes that fiat currency usage will be a laughable anachronism in five years.\nBut for now at least, with the bitcoin price down by more than half from its peak, the original crypto asset has about the same market value as the largest banknote in circulation. That bill is Brunei’s B$10,000 note, which is worth about $7,482, roughly the same as bitcoin these days, at around $7,500.\nThe legal tender—featuring a portrait of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah—was issued in 2006. Such large denominations aren’t convenient for a typical wallet, but could be useful during an emergency or during wartime, as well as for illicit purposes.\nThe Brunei dollar’s value is legally par with the currency of Singapore, which has its own S$10,000 bill (though it is no longer issued). The tiny nation of Brunei is pretty much the opposite of crypto believers’ decentralized ideal.\nBolkiah, one of the richest people in the world, is among the few remaining absolute monarchs and one of the longest reigning, according to the BBC. Thanks to vast oil and gas fields, which account for nearly the entire economy, its gross domestic product per capita is among the highest in the world.

The major crypto exchange is thinking about opening an office in Uganda and we have covered the story in today’s Bitcoin in Brief. Also, online trade with cryptos spikes in Bahrain, while in Georgia, luxury real estate is being sold for bitcoin. All this has been happening in an otherwise bearish May. Binance to Open Office in Uganda\nBinance is considering the possibility of opening a new office in Uganda , company CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference 2018, which took place at the end of May in Kampala, the country’s capital. The move is part of the trading platform’s plans to support the economic transformation of the African nation and increase youth employment through blockchain technology implementation. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has offices in Japan, Hong Kong, Malta , and intends to establish a global compliance center in Bermuda .\nWith the help of companies like Binance, “Uganda will be able to join the 4th Industrial Revolution, subsequently a lot of new jobs will open and the flow of investment into the country will increase,” Zhao said. “Watching this conference I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” he stated.\nIn April, Binance’ CEO announced a partnership with Crypto Savannah, an African blockchain innovation hub, Msingi, an organization working to build the East African industries of the future, and the “Made in Africa” Initiative. In a post on Twitter, Changpeng Zhao promised “thousands of jobs and bringing investments to Uganda.”“Expect more news on Africa!” he added in the comments.\nIn a statement during the conference in Kampala, Zhao noted that most banks in Europe, the US, and China criticize cryptocurrencies and do everything possible to crush them, and added: “It seems to me that Africa has real chances of becoming one of the leading regions in the implementation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.” Bearish May Brings Down Trading Volumes\nMore than $606 billion in cryptocurrencies have been traded last month through over 1,600 different cryptocurrencies, according to Coinmarketcap . The total is less than half the $1.4 trillion in more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies traded during the previous monthly period, 24/7 Wall St reports. The data shows a bearish May following a rather bullish April. With a 30-day volume of $184.31 billion, bitcoin (BTC) is the most traded cryptocurrency.\nThe last several months have seen another negative trend – in futures trading. Since March, the contracts have dropped by a third. Nymex bitcoin futures have lost more than 51% since trading began in January. Bitcoin June futures on Cboe traded down about 1.9% at noon on Wednesday. The expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25 also influenced cryptocurrency prices. Crypto Trade Booming in Bahrain\nIn some parts of the world, however, things do not look so bleak. Since the beginning of this year, more jurisdictions have begun to legally recognize cryptocurrencies, one way or another. These include the US, Canada, many members of the European Union, and several African and Asian nations.\nBahrain , a country credited for building the first post-oil economy in the Persian Gulf, has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency, according to local media. In the absence of official regulations, bitcoin transactions have been booming on Bahraini websites and social media. A shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in the Riffa area, Albawaba Business reported.\nThe island nation has also indicated it may soon emerge as a global cryptocurrency exchange hub. In March, the government in Manama set up a “regulatory sandbox” for that purpose. “As long as the business qualifies as fintech, we will welcome it,” said Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, quoted by Business Line . At least four crypto trading platforms are already registered there.\nThe sector, however, is still awaiting a final decision on the legal tender status of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is supposed to come from the Central Bank of Bahrain, which is the country’s financial regulator. Real Estate Sold for Bitcoin in Georgia\nA luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins (~$190,000) in Georgia . According to local realtors, the owner has explicitly asked the price to be announced in cryptocurrency, Geomigrant reports. The current legislation does not mention crypto payments. Despite the lack of a regulatory framework, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a means of exchange and trade among Georgians.\nThe Caucasian country is known as a major crypto mining hub in Eurasia thanks to some tax incentives and low electricity rates. According to a recently published study by the World Bank, around 5% of Georgian households participate in cryptocurrency trading and investing. Blockchain technologies have also spread in Georgia.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

But technical charts are beginning to show a budding attempt of a reversal.\nNews-wise, this week hasn't provided any market moving events but there were a few intriguing posts from Twitter technical analysts.\nTwitter user FilbFilb , for example, argues that the Money Flow Indicator serves as a reliable oscillator for measuring buying and selling pressure and his or her charts demonstrate how it could be used to forecast BTC movement.\nMeanwhile, Roger Quantrillo posted his mic drop BTC triangle chart which provides plenty of food for thought.\nNow, those are beautiful charts that provoke all sorts of bearish and bullish thoughts but it should be noted that cryptocurrency price movement (especially Bitcoin) does not happen in a vacuum.\nSo, reliance on one oscillator, or any combination of technical analysis tools has yet to be proven as being capable of providing reliable data for BTC price direction and the same observation applies to the charts below.\nDaily Chart\nAt the time of writing, BTC continues to trade near the bottom leg of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA continuing to plummet well below the 50-day MA.\nSince dropping to $7,043 on May 29th, BTC has been pinned between $7,200 – $7,600 and is slowing working its way towards the next levels of resistance at $7,650 and $7,870 (20-day MA).\nEncouragingly, there appears to be an inverse head and shoulders formation developing, but to confirm this, BTC needs to meet the neckline slightly above $7,600.\nBoth the RSI and Stoch are angled upward and heading into bullish territory as BTC approaches $7,600, which supports the case for BTC extending to $7,850 in the near term.\n4HR Chart\nThe 4 hour chart paints a more positive picture with the 5 and 10-day MA crossed, moving upward, and above the 50-MA. The 50,100 and 200-MA continue to slope downward in favor of bears so traders should keep an eye on volume as the pop could be short lived in the event of a gains above $7,850.\nOn May 31st, BTC posted an outside-day candle, which is a bullish indicator as the higher low hints at a price reversal. The possibility of a reversal is further supported by the bullish divergence seen on the RSI oscillator.\nCombined, all of these factors, along with the nearing completion of an inverse head and shoulders formation, make a strong case for the possibility of a bullish reversal.\nBitcoin Price: Looking Ahead BTC appears to be wrapping up a period of consolidation and gearing up for a breakout.\nIn the short-term, a test of the descending channel trendline near $7,850 is probable and traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of the movement. If there is strong buying pressure BTC could run up to $8,520 (50-day MA on the daily chart).\nFailure to break and stay above the $7,650 resistance could see BTC pullback to a soft resistance level at $7,100, followed by a stronger resistance at $6,750. Hence, it is recommended to keep an eye on volume and the position of the Stoch and RSI in the event of a reversal.\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

During this hour plus long interview, Jason asks Caitlin about her background working on Wall St, how she found the Austrian School of Economics and why she likes the Austrian School? Jason and Caitlin discuss the global macro situation and why the US Dollar has not collapsed and why there has not been hyperinflation in consumer prices in the US yet?Next, Jason asks Caitlin about when she found Bitcoin and why she likes it? Caitlin thinks Bitcoin can help restore sound money and also help to fix a corrupt, inefficient and in some cases broken financial system. To wrap up the interview, Jason asks Caitlin about Fedcoin, a cashless society and how governments and central banks may be working on centralized versions of government issued crypto currency.Please visit the Wall St for Main St website here: http://www.wallstformainst.com/ Follow Jason Burack on Twitter @JasonEBurackFollow Wall St for Main St on Twitter @WallStforMainSt Commit to tipping us monthly for our hard work creating high level, thought proving content about investing and the economy https://www.patreon.com/wallstformainst Also, please take 5 minutes to leave us a good iTunes review here!

Bitconnect Promoters Face an Investor’s Wrath\nAs per a report, Bitconnect’s India chapter was managed in the state of Gujarat by three men, Diyash Darji, Satish Kumbhani, and Dhaval Mavani, who worked with the project’s promoters abroad and persuaded Indian investors to invest in the now-infamous venture.\nThe trio aggressively promoted Bitconnect as a good investment option, and guaranteed a “very high return on investment.”\nOne such investor was Shailesh Bhatt, who gave in to the company’s vision and brought the firm’s “1.1 percent profit per day” scheme. However, when the company invariably showed an inability to pay back his money, an enraged Bhatt ganged up with eight others on Mavani in December 2017, and extorted 2,000 bitcoins from the promoter.\nUnfortunately, Bhatt did not enjoy his ill-gotten gains for long, as he picked up a month later from his residence near Gujarat’s capital.\nCID officials were able to question Bhatt’s nephew – Nikunj – who was apparently part of the extortion gang as he possessed 12 bitcoins from the 2,000 bitcoin haul. ‘\nA CID official lended insight on the firm:\nApart from India, the firm has its presence in Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and the US. We have identified a few accounts associated with the transactions and have intimated the respective banks about it. Bitconnect 101\nAs per Nikunj’s statements, the firm used a special software that supposedly calculated high and low points of bitcoin’s price action, and claimed that the system traded the currency for an average of 1 percent return daily or 365 percent annually.\nThe company reportedly had investment slabs to further lure investors. For example, if a person invested between $1,000 and $5,000, an extra 0.1 percent was added to his earning. Likewise, the extra incentive increased with each slab, with the largest slab offering 0.25 percent extra returns per day.\nInterestingly, despite India’s resistance towards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the CID said that it shall convert the recovered bitcoins into Indian Rupees and store them with the country’s central bank.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bitconnect-promised-1-daily-return-on-bitcoin-investments-cid/articleshow/64375475.cms"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satish kumbhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaval mavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diyash darji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crime investigation department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T15:57:52.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93c81651ae29c0aedd0f68b9be5cb6f84a5fc9bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_Ll0wuycDnw8B5aBSrMBuHu8-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for June 01, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for June 01, 2018", "published": "2018-06-01T13:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93c81651ae29c0aedd0f68b9be5cb6f84a5fc9bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_Ll0wuycDnw8B5aBSrMBuHu8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T13:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for June 01, 2018", "text": "01.06.2018 12:39 Bitcoin analysis for June 01, 2018\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading upwards.

The lightning network of Bitcoin which just begun operation for transactions is up for a returning. Lightning network is known said to make the capacity of bitcoin much larger than before – but it has a problem; users of the network need to store a very huge amount of data on their own. The actual problem of this is that downloading this data becomes very difficult and makes the network difficult to run. Difficulty in running the network is essentially opposed to the core idea behind the creation bitcoin to begin with. This is why the developers of the lightning network are looking at how to make available a simpler off-chain transaction medium as an alternative to the current network. “Eltoo”, as it will be called, is the next project of developers Rusty Russell, Laolu Osuntokun, and Christian Decker.\nEltoo will be looking at storing data of just “the most recent off -chain transactions” to help avoid data loss and cryptocurrency loss eventually. Decker, noted that losing cryptocurrency because of a lightning network issue was a thing he had personally experienced. He said “I had an old lightning node on my laptop. I restored it. I didn’t know I didn’t have the newest state. The guy closed the connection because they knew it was an old state! Because he could steal it. Which he did, by the way.” Eltoo Will Solve The Long Term Revoking Issue of Bitcoin\nBitcoin developers have long being looking at alternatives to the storing of huge chunks of data on the blockchain network. The first idea was to assign numbers – sequence numbers – to transactions such that each transaction given a unique number which was updated per transaction by the miners. However, a hiccup to this was that miners did not have any reason at all to update or replace old numbers with newer ones of newer transactions. Thus money loss in such a system was just too haunting an idea to bear with. This prompted the need for a fix. And then came the L2 network which came up with the penalty for miners who refused to update the transaction numbers. The punishment was that the cheating miner lost money for using an older transaction number for a newer transaction.\nSurprisingly, Eltoo will be going back to the allocation of sequence numbers but this time around with the code to ensure the number updates are done by miners. Commenting on the differences of both the L2 network and Eltoo, Decker stated in a CoinDesk interview that “Eltoo has quite different tradeoffs. I’m not implying it’s better in all senses,… We don’t know which one is nicer, but I would like eltoo as the better option. I think eltoo is easier to explain and to extend later on.”\nShould the proposal for the update go through, Bitcoin’s codebase will have to be updated with the sighash code. This alone could take forever, Decker believes jokingly; alluding to how long it took for SegWit to be implemented. What happens next will definitely go a long way to affecting the way Bitcoin performs on the market. It appears that most developers are excited by the proposal of Eltoo, and are anticipating its introduction. The name Eltoo is actually a phonetic play on “L 2”, standing for Layer 2, a term mostly used to refer to lightning networks for off chain transactions.\nJoin the conversation on Telegram .\nFeatured Images Courtesy of Coinstaker.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://t.me/coinstaker"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laolu osuntokun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusty russell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "major lightning network upgrade home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major lightning network upgrade", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T13:32:50.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3034506addcda4047d2dca4f04372a7e9da630bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVf5EykVhDyOfrtWvf3kUJE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Can any other crypto replace bitcoin?", "title_full": "Can any other crypto replace bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-01T13:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3034506addcda4047d2dca4f04372a7e9da630bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVf5EykVhDyOfrtWvf3kUJE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nicolebtccrypto", "published": "2018-06-01T13:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can any other crypto replace bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: TheHashkon on April 17, 2018, 12:36:41 PM There are many cryptocurrencies out there, the fluctuation is wide and big.

Robert Shiller’s view on the future of cryptocurrency Jun 1, 2018\nThe cryptocurrency market has been constantly oscillating between the highs and lows, proving that the value of Bitcoin [BTC] is directly proportional to the market value.\nRobert Shiller, the famous economist, and Nobel prize winner was present at CNBC’s Trading Nation recently.\nShiller is quite popular among the cryptocurrency community for his negative comments on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In one of his recent interviews, he mentioned that Bitcoin is an example of faddish human behavior.\nShiller, who is also an Economics Professor at Yale University thinks that Bitcoin will face extinction in the next 100 years. He says that Bitcoin would not look like anything that it is today if it exists and it would probably have a different name.\nConsidering the many hard forks it undergoes very often which leads to the constant change of the coin, it will be just a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.\nHe continued to say that he does not want to be dismissive about Bitcoin, however, considering its previous behavior, it is very hard to predict about the cryptocurrency.\nShiller says:\n“It looks like a bubble, but it is getting people enthusiastic and there are a thousands of cryptocurrencies. Something good might come out of this.”\nHe also mentioned that most of his students are interested in Bitcoin and its trading. The Cryptocurrency community reacted to Shiller’s comment on the future of Bitcoin with multiple opinions.\nA Cryptocurrency enthusiast says:\n“You literally won’t be able to see this happen so why care ? It’s not like we cared about the extinction of carrying pigeons we literally find better things and moved on. #trash just like your show”\nA Twitterati named Crypto Shoppe says:\n“ BTC’s lack of recent innovation with cause it’s doom. While BCH, ETH, and EOS are gearing up for major innovation.”\nPhil Geiger, a Bitcoin enthusiast, and Economics student says:\n“Counterpoint: Bitcoin will be the global currency by 2118. 10 years ago money creation was limited to the state and Bitcoin didn’t exist. It has crashed to $7,000 a coin in 9.5 years and adoption is increasing.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will John McAfee’s Prediction Hold True? bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto ,\nBitcoin price is running but she’s not out of the woods yet. Technical charts show a pack of angry bears right at the heel, but at last, in swoops a hero!\nIs it volume?\nIs it the cavalry composed of fat cat institutional investors and bitcoin beluga whales?\nNope.\nAt the edge of the tree-line, waiting with hands extended…or actually, tapping to the rescue via Twitter is the one and only person who can restore Bitcoin to its rightful place above 10k.\nJohn McAfee? John McAfee\nMcAfee recently reaffirmed his belief that bitcoin will trade above $15,000 by June 12th and voila, BTC price popped right up to $7,600 yesterday. At this point, one cannot draw a direct connection between the words of a notorious coin shill and changes in bitcoin price, but it can’t be disputed that McAfee’s statements had an effect on the prices of multiple cryptocurrencies in the past. Market Overview\nFor the moment, the valor of McAfee’s chivalrous shill appeal appear to have had little impact as Bitcoin’s technical setup remains relatively unchanged. But technical charts are beginning to show a budding attempt of a reversal.\nNews-wise, this week hasn’t provided any market moving events but there were a few intriguing posts from Twitter technical analysts.\nTwitter user FilbFilb , for example, argues that the Money Flow Indicator serves as a reliable oscillator for measuring buying and selling pressure and his or her charts demonstrate how it could be used to forecast BTC movement.\nMeanwhile, Roger Quantrillo posted his mic drop BTC triangle chart which provides plenty of food for thought.\nNow, those are beautiful charts that provoke all sorts of bearish and bullish thoughts but it should be noted that cryptocurrency price movement (especially Bitcoin) does not happen in a vacuum.\nSo, reliance on one oscillator, or any combination of technical analysis tools has yet to be proven as being capable of providing reliable data for BTC price direction and the same observation applies to the charts below. Daily Chart\nAt the time of writing, BTC continues to trade near the bottom leg of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA continuing to plummet well below the 50-day MA.\nSince dropping to $7,043 on May 29th, BTC has been pinned between $7,200 – $7,600 and is slowing working its way towards the next levels of resistance at $7,650 and $7,870 (20-day MA).\nEncouragingly, there appears to be an inverse head and shoulders formation developing, but to confirm this, BTC needs to meet the neckline slightly above $7,600.\nBoth the RSI and Stoch are angled upward and heading into bullish territory as BTC approaches $7,600, which supports the case for BTC extending to $7,850 in the near term. 4HR Chart\nThe 4 hour chart paints a more positive picture with the 5 and 10-day MA crossed, moving upward, and above the 50-MA. The 50,100 and 200-MA continue to slope downward in favor of bears so traders should keep an eye on volume as the pop could be short lived in the event of a gains above $7,850.\nOn May 31st, BTC posted an outside-day candle, which is a bullish indicator as the higher low hints at a price reversal. The possibility of a reversal is further supported by the bullish divergence seen on the RSI oscillator.\nCombined, all of these factors, along with the nearing completion of an inverse head and shoulders formation, make a strong case for the possibility of a bullish reversal. Bitcoin Price: Looking Ahead\nBTC appears to be wrapping up a period of consolidation and gearing up for a breakout.\nIn the short-term, a test of the descending channel trendline near $7,850 is probable and traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of the movement. If there is strong buying pressure BTC could run up to $8,520 (50-day MA on the daily chart).\nFailure to break and stay above the $7,650 resistance could see BTC pullback to a soft resistance level at $7,100, followed by a stronger resistance at $6,750. Hence, it is recommended to keep an eye on volume and the position of the Stoch and RSI in the event of a reversal.\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Many people are familiar with Bitcoin but have now become aware that many other cryptocurrencies also exist. Litecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that followed Bitcoin. In fact, Litecoin was created to complement the use of Bitcoin.\nCryptocurrencies make use of algorithms to encrypt transactions. As transactions occur, the transaction information is added to the blockchain. This method allows the participants in the network to generate more blocks for rewards, and to regulate the transactions without the interference of a centralized authority, such as a bank. Furthermore, the encryption avoids duplication of transactions.\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamato in 2009. Nakamato wanted to create a decentralized currency that would use advanced encryption to avoid transaction processing errors. Bitcoin was sold for less than $1 when it was originally released but has experienced tremendous growth. It now costs more than $8000 for a Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin has experienced extreme fluctuations which have resulted in the value crashing at times.\nBitcoin has made 21 million coins available, which are generated as transactions occur. Bitcoin uses a powerful algorithm to confirm transactions. It has immense parallel processing power.\nWhat is Litecoin?\nCharlie Lee, an engineer who previously worked at Google, created Litecoin. Lee used the open source code released by Satoshi Nakamato to create this new cryptocurrency. Furthermore, Lee released Litecoin with the aim of becoming the “silver” which complements the “gold” of Bitcoin.\nThere are 84 million Litecoins available. The algorithm used to confirm a transaction is easier to understand for ordinary individuals. This means there are larger possibilities for mining Litecoin instead of just purchasing coins.\nDifference between Bitcoin and Litecoin Creation details\nBitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009; Litecoin was created by Charles Lee in October 2011. Amount available\nBitcoin will make 21 million coins available whereas Litecoin will make 84 million coins available. Current value\nThe value of Bitcoin and Litecoin fluctuates in a similar fashion to stocks. On 17 May, one Bitcoin was valued at $8263, whereas the value of one Litecoin was $137.74. Algorithms\nBitcoin uses an algorithm called SHA-256. It is a complex algorithm for processing but can process parallel transactions. Most individuals have difficulty understanding the algorithm and thus do not mine Bitcoin.\nLitecoin makes use of the Scrypt algorithm, which is easier to understand for most people. It allows users to purchase and mine Litecoin, thus providing additional rewards. Transaction speeds\nTechnically, the transactions for both cryptocurrencies happen instantaneously. However, cryptocurrency transactions need to be confirmed by other users of the network. The time it takes for the transaction to be confirmed is what constitutes the transaction speed. This can also be called the average block speed.\nIt takes about 10 minutes for a Bitcoin transaction to be processed in contrast to a 2.5 minute transaction speed for Litecoin. The faster transacting speed of Litecoin makes it more appealing to merchants who accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method, especially if the merchant waits for confirmation.\nThe faster transaction speed of Litecoin also makes it possible for more transactions to be completed in a set time, when compared to the amount of transactions possible by Bitcoin in the same time period. Reward for new block\nNew blocks result in the creation of new Bitcoins and Litecoins. This process is called “mining” and individuals that mine Bitcoin or Litecoin are rewarded with coins.\nBitcoin (BTC) initially rewarded miners with 50BTC per block and this amount halves with every 210,000 blocks mined. Currently, the Bitcoin reward per block is 12.5BTC.\nLitecoin (LTC) also started with a reward of 50 BTC with the amount halving every 840,000 blocks. The current reward per block is 25LTC. Bitcoin vs. Litecoin: Comparison Chart\nSummary of Bitcoin vs. Litecoin Bitcoin and Litecoin are cryptocurrencies created from the same open source code but run on different blockchains. Bitcoin has made 21 million coins available, whereas Litecoin made 84 million coins available. Each Bitcoin has a much higher dollar value than a single Litecoin; this makes true the view that Litecoins is “silver” and Bitcoin is “gold”. Bitcoin runs on the SHA-256 algorithm and Litecoin runs on the Scrypt algorithm. Bitcoin’s algorithm is complex, whereas Litecoin’s algorithm is easy to understand. Transactions happen instantaneously but transaction speed is based on how long it takes for a transaction to be confirmed. This can also be described as the amount of time to create a new block. The algorithms affect the transaction speed: Bitcoin’s complex algorithm takes approximately 10 minutes to confirm a transaction, whereas a transaction with Litecoin takes about 2.5 minutes before receiving confirmation. Litecoin’s faster transacting speed makes it appealing to merchants that would like to offer clients an opportunity to pay with a cryptocurrency. Miners are individuals that confirm transactions (create a block) and are all part of the network. A miner receives a reward for a completed block. Bitcoin currently rewards miners with 12.5BTC per block, but this value is halved with every 210,000 blocks. Litecoin rewards a miner with 25LTC per block and this value is halved with every 840,000 blocks created. Cryptocurrencies are becoming very popular. The creation of Bitcoin and subsequent release of its open-source code has made it possible for many other cryptocurrencies to be created, including Litecoin.

Nela, um dos integrantes apresentava o investimento que prometia retornos estratosfĂŠricos em um curto perĂodo de tempo: o bitcoin .Â Â Toledo nĂŁo teve dĂşvidas e seguiu os passos do amigo. Insatisfeito com o rendimento tĂmido que tinha em um CDB (Certificado de DepĂłsito BancĂĄrio), sacou logo os cerca de 30 mil reais que estavam no investimento conservador. Abriu entĂŁo uma conta em uma corretora que negociava a criptomoeda e alocou seu dinheiro no novo sucesso do momento.\nâ€œNĂŁo sabia muito bem do que se tratava. Obviamente, li a respeito, mas nĂŁo conhecia o mercado. [O investimento] foi mais no susto mesmo, por achar que estava perdendo a oportunidade de ter um retorno muito alto e rĂĄpidoâ€, conta ele.\nVeja tambĂŠm Economia Corretoras de bitcoin enfrentam pressĂŁo de bancos 26 abr 2018 - 11h04 Economia Mercado Bitcoin projeta movimentar R$ 50 bilhĂľes em 2018 8 mar 2018 - 12h03 Mas, o hit do verĂŁo esfriou e nĂŁo rendeu aquilo que o integrante do grupo prometeu para esses investidores tardios. A desvalorizaĂ§ĂŁo fez o bitcoin, uma das chamadas moedas digitais negociadas da internet, perder mais de 50% do seu preĂ§o desde entĂŁo.\nNaquele mĂŞs de dezembro, a criptomoeda registrou uma cotaĂ§ĂŁo histĂłrica, atingindo incrĂveisÂ 19.343 dĂłlares a unidade (72.278 reais). Nesta quarta-feira, a moeda chegou a 7.292 dĂłlares (27.248 reais) – menos da metade do que valia no Ăşltimo mĂŞs do ano passado\nO mĂŠdico, contudo, nĂŁo foi o Ăşnico que agiu Ă s pressas e agora nĂŁo sabe o que fazer. Os Ăşltimos meses de 2017 tiveram um verdadeiro â€˜efeito manadaâ€™ em relaĂ§ĂŁo ao ativo. As duas principais corretoras do Brasil registraram enorme crescimento na base de clientes e nos montantes movimentados por aqui.\nA corretora Mercado Bitcoin, por exemplo, saltou de 200 mil clientes no inĂcio do ano passado para um milhĂŁo no inĂcio deste ano. JĂĄ a Foxbit, outra grande corretora brasileira, passou de 50 mil clientes e cerca de sete funcionĂĄrios para 400 mil clientes e 75 colaboradores.Â Para efeito de comparaĂ§ĂŁo, em abril, Ăşltimo dado disponĂvel, a B3, a bolsa de valores brasileira, contava com 663 mil clientes pessoas fĂsicas, que investem em inĂşmeras empresas lĂĄ listadas.\nâ€œEm uma quarta-feira do mĂŞs de dezembro, a gente negociava 20 milhĂľes de reais e logo no dia seguinte negociamos 140 milhĂľes de reais. Foi um crescimento absurdo em muito pouco tempo. O bitcoin era matĂŠria em muitos portais e fazia muita gente sem conhecimento entrar para tentar ficar rico. Isso fez muita gente comprar no topoâ€, conta Guto Schiavon, sĂłcio-fundador da FoxBit.\nEssa corrida iniciada em dezembro, inclusive, nĂŁo ĂŠ vista como positiva pelas corretoras dado os problemas causados por investidores sem experiĂŞncia e com um volume muito alto. Por isso, elas jĂĄ pensam em criar plataformas para oferecer educaĂ§ĂŁo financeira a quem quiser investir.\n&& O que fazer agora? Com tanta gente correndo para entrar em algo que nĂŁo conheciam e que viria a cair, o resultado ĂŠ meio Ăłbvio. Quem entrou antes, por exemplo, ainda continua no lucro.Â Mas, apĂłs o efeito manada, a maioria dos investidores vem perdendo dinheiro e agora nĂŁo sabe o que fazer com as fraĂ§Ăľes de bitcoin compradas.\nAntes de mais nada, contudo, ĂŠ necessĂĄrio entender que o bitcoin e as demais criptomoedas sĂŁo considerados ativos de alto risco e extremamente volĂĄteis. Dessa forma, podem subir muito (e cair muito tambĂŠm) em um curto perĂodo de tempo.\nSegundo especialistas consultados por VEJA , a queda do preĂ§o do bitcoin pode ser considerada normal. Apenas em 2017, ele subiu cerca de 1.700% e, por isso, uma correĂ§ĂŁo jĂĄ era esperada.\nâ€œPara o bitcoin pouquĂssima coisa mudou. No final do ano passado houve um efeito manada e uma hora corrige [o valor]. Mas, se pegar termos tĂŠcnicos, nada aconteceu. SĂł uma variaĂ§ĂŁo de mercado meio tradicionalâ€, diz Schiavon.\nAlĂŠm da correĂ§ĂŁo natural, o mercado de criptomoedas em geral tambĂŠm enfrentou contestaĂ§Ăľes e problemas de regulaĂ§ĂŁo em paĂses como China e Coreia do Sul. No Brasil, por exemplo, a CVM (ComissĂŁo de Valores MobiliĂĄrios, que regula o mercado financeiro) proibiu fundos de investimento de alocar recursos em tal ativo.\nMesmo com os problemas que vem enfrentando e a perda de valor recente, o importante ĂŠ que cada investidor procure entender como funciona o ativo e, a partir daĂ, trace uma estratĂŠgia para obter ganhos ou, ao menos, diminuir as perdas.\nâ€œCabe a avaliaĂ§ĂŁo por parte de cada investidor. Eu nĂŁo vejo nada que possa explicar a volta do patamar [histĂłrico]. Se eu fosse apostar no cenĂĄrio, seria a estabilizaĂ§ĂŁo. A partir do momento que ela [a criptomoeda] tiver maturidade suficiente, com oferta e demanda, e nĂŁo apenas para especulaĂ§ĂŁo, aĂ o cenĂĄrio pode mudarâ€, afirma Caio Villares, presidente da Ancord (AssociaĂ§ĂŁo Nacional das Corretoras e Distribuidoras de TĂtulos e Valores MobiliĂĄrios, CĂ˘mbio e Mercadorias)\nPara AndrĂŠ Perfeito, economista-chefe da Spinelli Corretora, o bitcoin pode atĂŠ se beneficiar como investimento alternativo graĂ§as a instabilidade dos mercados tradicionais. Assim, quem investiu lĂĄ atrĂĄs deve pensar em segurar o ativo por mais tempo.Â Â AlĂŠm disso, para o economista, essa corrida ao bitcoin pode ajudar o brasileiro a, finalmente, entender um pouco mais sobre o mercado em um momento em que as taxas de juros sĂŁo menores e, assim, investimentos conservadores nĂŁo rendem tanto.\nâ€œO brasileiro estĂĄ muito pouco habituado ao mercado de capitais. Acho que o bitcoin pode servir de porta de entrada para esse poupador conhecer melhor. Se de um lado havia muita fantasia sobre o bitcoin, talvez as corretoras ajudem no inĂcio da educaĂ§ĂŁo financeira do brasileiroâ€, diz ele.\nNĂŁo Ă toa, as empresas que comercializam bitcoin passaram a oferecer cursos para explicar melhor aos investidores o funcionamento e os riscos de cada investimento.Â â€œA gente estĂĄ fazendo uma sĂŠrie de vĂdeos de educaĂ§ĂŁo [financeira] pois estamos realmente preocupados em divulgar issoâ€, afirma Luiz Roberto Calado, economista-chefe do Mercado Bitcoin.Â â€œReconhecendo que ĂŠ algo novo, ĂŠ da nossa responsabilidade esclarecer que hĂĄ riscos. Por isso educamos para eles entenderem que existe uma volatilidade e que o preĂ§o pode oscilarâ€, completa.\nGosta de riscos? HĂĄ outros produtos Para aqueles que apostaram no bitcoin justamente pelo risco (e probabilidade de alto retorno), o mercado de capitais possui outros produtos que podem ajudar a saciar tal apetite.\nUma delas ĂŠ a opĂ§ĂŁo de aĂ§Ăľes. De forma resumida, a opĂ§ĂŁo ĂŠ um direito que o investidor adquire de comprar uma aĂ§ĂŁo por um preĂ§o prĂŠ-determinado. Por exemplo: o investidor pode comprar uma opĂ§ĂŁo de aĂ§ĂŁo da Petrobras por 10 reais. Se no dia do vencimento, ela estiver acima disso, como em 20 reais, vale o prĂŠ-acordado e ele lucra a diferenĂ§a. Se estiver abaixo, perde todo o capital investido.\nO ponto positivo ĂŠ que o investidor pode limitar as perdas pelo capital investido, mas caso acerte, pode multiplicĂĄ-lo. Quem se interessar pelo produto precisa estudar como ele funciona antes de tomar qualquer decisĂŁo.\nâ€œAos que gostam realmente de investimento de risco, opĂ§Ăľes sĂŁo coisas que vocĂŞ pode multiplicar o capital, mas vocĂŞ estĂĄ consciente e disposto a perdĂŞ-lo. Obviamente, ninguĂŠm acerta nada e sempre no curto prazoâ€, conta Caio Villares, da Ancord.\nPara alĂŠm das opĂ§Ăľes, especialistas alertam que investimentos bons sĂŁo os variados. Por isso, o investidor que quiser multiplicar o capital de forma responsĂĄvel deve mesclar diversos tipos de produtos, como renda fixa, variĂĄvel e, se possĂvel, contar com o auxĂlio de profissionais para tal.\nOutras modalidades de investimento para quem tem apetite por risco: COE\nO Certificado de OperaĂ§Ăľes Estruturadas (COE) tenta somar a seguranĂ§a de uma renda fixa com os rendimentos da renda variĂĄvel. Esse investimento ĂŠ basicamente uma cesta que possui investimentos conservadores (TĂtulos, CDBâ€™s, entre outros) e arrojados (moedas, opĂ§Ăľes de aĂ§Ăľes, etc). Esse mix pode trazer bons frutos ao investidor, sem correr tanto risco.\nEmprĂŠstimo peer-to-peer lending\nApesar de ser bem recente no paĂs, esse tipo de investimento liga as pessoas que desejam emprestar dinheiro para empresas que necessitam tomar emprĂŠstimos. O investimento inicial ĂŠ pequeno (pois a empresa junta diversos investidores para cada emprĂŠstimo concedido). O lado positivo ĂŠ que o investidor pode multiplicar o capital. O negativo ĂŠ o risco de calote.\nAĂ§Ăľes\nApesar de tambĂŠm ser um investimento de renda variĂĄvel, o mercado de aĂ§Ăľes ĂŠ mais previsĂvel que o bitcoin. No Brasil, hĂĄ menos investidores na Bolsa do que no mercado de bitcoins. Assim, quem quer rendimentos maiores, tem necessariamente que correr mais riscos e o mercado acionĂĄrio pode ser uma boa chance.\nFundos acionĂĄrios\nSĂŁo fundos que congregam milhares de investidores e colocam os recursos em aĂ§Ăľes e estĂŁo disponĂveis em algumas corretoras do paĂs. Mas, como possui gestĂŁo profissional, o interessado nĂŁo precisa ficar acompanhando ou entender muito do mercado de aĂ§Ăľes e suas nuances e pode alocar seu dinheiro em empresas nacionais ou atĂŠ internacionais.\nFundos imobiliĂĄrios\nNesses fundos, o investidor poderĂĄ comprar cotas de diversos tipos de negĂłcio com base imobiliĂĄria, como novos empreendimentos, imĂłveis prontos, shoppings, etc. Funciona como se dividisse o negĂłcio em milhares de pedaĂ§os e cada pessoa comprasse um. Os rendimentos, como aluguel, venda depois de valorizaĂ§ĂŁo, entre outros, tambĂŠm sĂŁo divididos entre esses â€˜donosâ€™.\nVEJA ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel toledo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obviamente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "certificado de depăłsito bancăąrio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "economia mercado bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T13:03:31.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33854db784d563e2a05c389a2b920c360e727d69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3C9DMPgG4R_M_wz8npbD1Y4UN6NctILetTbMX73PGHHlDiva2VJrBOx0yNgfgWzeTia2wYmgfZMWNyqlzW9DM-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "https://insidebitcoins.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Inside Bitcoins – News, Price, Events", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will John McAfee’s Prediction Hold True?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will John McAfee’s Prediction Hold True?", "published": "2018-06-01T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-01-at-8.57.13-AM-150x150.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33854db784d563e2a05c389a2b920c360e727d69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3C9DMPgG4R_M_wz8npbD1Y4UN6NctILetTbMX73PGHHlDiva2VJrBOx0yNgfgWzeTia2wYmgfZMWNyqlzW9DM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eustace Cryptus", "published": "2018-06-01T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will John McAfee’s Prediction Hold True?", "text": "\nBitcoin price is running but she’s not out of the woods yet. Technical charts show a pack of angry bears right at the heel, but at last, in swoops a hero!\nIs it volume?\nIs it the cavalry composed of fat cat institutional investors and bitcoin beluga whales?\nNope.\nAt the edge of the tree-line, waiting with hands extended…or actually, tapping to the rescue via Twitter is the one and only person who can restore Bitcoin to its rightful place above 10k.\nJohn McAfee? John McAfee\nMcAfee recently reaffirmed his belief that bitcoin will trade above $15,000 by June 12th and voila, BTC price popped right up to $7,600 yesterday. At this point, one cannot draw a direct connection between the words of a notorious coin shill and changes in bitcoin price, but it can’t be disputed that McAfee’s statements had an effect on the prices of multiple cryptocurrencies in the past. Market Overview\nFor the moment, the valor of McAfee’s chivalrous shill appeal appear to have had little impact as Bitcoin’s technical setup remains relatively unchanged. But technical charts are beginning to show a budding attempt of a reversal.\nNews-wise, this week hasn’t provided any market moving events but there were a few intriguing posts from Twitter technical analysts.\nTwitter user FilbFilb , for example, argues that the Money Flow Indicator serves as a reliable oscillator for measuring buying and selling pressure and his or her charts demonstrate how it could be used to forecast BTC movement.\nMeanwhile, Roger Quantrillo posted his mic drop BTC triangle chart which provides plenty of food for thought.\nNow, those are beautiful charts that provoke all sorts of bearish and bullish thoughts but it should be noted that cryptocurrency price movement (especially Bitcoin) does not happen in a vacuum.\nSo, reliance on one oscillator, or any combination of technical analysis tools has yet to be proven as being capable of providing reliable data for BTC price direction and the same observation applies to the charts below. Daily Chart\nAt the time of writing, BTC continues to trade near the bottom leg of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA continuing to plummet well below the 50-day MA.\nSince dropping to $7,043 on May 29th, BTC has been pinned between $7,200 – $7,600 and is slowing working its way towards the next levels of resistance at $7,650 and $7,870 (20-day MA).\nEncouragingly, there appears to be an inverse head and shoulders formation developing, but to confirm this, BTC needs to meet the neckline slightly above $7,600.\nBoth the RSI and Stoch are angled upward and heading into bullish territory as BTC approaches $7,600, which supports the case for BTC extending to $7,850 in the near term. 4HR Chart\nThe 4 hour chart paints a more positive picture with the 5 and 10-day MA crossed, moving upward, and above the 50-MA. The 50,100 and 200-MA continue to slope downward in favor of bears so traders should keep an eye on volume as the pop could be short lived in the event of a gains above $7,850.\nOn May 31st, BTC posted an outside-day candle, which is a bullish indicator as the higher low hints at a price reversal. The possibility of a reversal is further supported by the bullish divergence seen on the RSI oscillator.\nCombined, all of these factors, along with the nearing completion of an inverse head and shoulders formation, make a strong case for the possibility of a bullish reversal. Bitcoin Price: Looking Ahead\nBTC appears to be wrapping up a period of consolidation and gearing up for a breakout.\nIn the short-term, a test of the descending channel trendline near $7,850 is probable and traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of the movement. If there is strong buying pressure BTC could run up to $8,520 (50-day MA on the daily chart).\nFailure to break and stay above the $7,650 resistance could see BTC pullback to a soft support level at $7,100, followed by stronger support at $6,750. Hence, it is recommended to keep an eye on volume and the position of the Stoch and RSI in the event of a reversal.\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

But the technology itself continues to develop, becoming stronger than ever! Here are 4 main aspects which help Bitcoin to remain a wise way to invest (despite of any corrections).\n1️⃣Transactions fees have dropped to their lowest levels in seven years Not since 2011 was it was so cheap to use Bitcoin, and it promises to become even cheaper in the future. Increasing expansion of the Lightning Network is expected to push fees below 1 satoshi per byte, so long-term transaction would cost nearly negligible amount.\n2️⃣Bitcoin's hashrate climbed to its largest in history in May Data from Blockchain republished on Twitter by trader and commentator CryptoYoda impressed users with theories including miners mining at a smaller profit in order to generate long-term holdings.\n3️⃣SegWit transactions This year witnessed mass uptake of Segregated Witness ('SegWit') technology, which for Bitcoin users also means lower fees and faster confirmation times.

But the technology itself continues to develop, becoming stronger than ever! Here are 4 main aspects which help Bitcoin to remain a wise way to invest (despite of any corrections).\n1️⃣Transactions fees have dropped to their lowest levels in seven years Not since 2011 was it was so cheap to use Bitcoin, and it promises to become even cheaper in the future. Increasing expansion of the Lightning Network is expected to push fees below 1 satoshi per byte, so long-term transaction would cost nearly negligible amount.\n2️⃣Bitcoin's hashrate climbed to its largest in history in May Data from Blockchain republished on Twitter by trader and commentator CryptoYoda impressed users with theories including miners mining at a smaller profit in order to generate long-term holdings.\n3️⃣SegWit transactions This year witnessed mass uptake of Segregated Witness ('SegWit') technology, which for Bitcoin users also means lower fees and faster confirmation times. SegWit transactions now make up a greater proportion of the total sent each week than ever before – almost 40%.\n4️⃣Worldwide bank system lacks trust Italy and the Eurozone under political pressure and Australia and New Zealand lenders both suffering mass technical outages which cut customers off from their funds.

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nI think it's more risky to invest with bitcoin because if investing with a bank if there is a problem already there is a legal institution that handles if bitcoin we will lose all without any legal entity that can help us, investment with big risks of course produce big profits too", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T17:13:17.012+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 24808, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=7400", "requestsLeft": 588}
