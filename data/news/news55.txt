However, it's been more successful as a form of investment, a \"speculative asset\".\nDo you guys think that this can change in the long term ?\nBitcoins failed as a currency mainly because of the over-inflated value against its very small supply. How can a currency like this take over the world when the actual supply can't even cover a whole country. And imagine only the rich and the middleclass men has access to bitcoins. A currency should be handled by anyone.\nYes It is certain there is an impact for the business world especially that has the dependence of raw materials from the outside. Inevitably very affected.

'Real traders' with suits, the talking heads, the IMF, the rothschildes for god's sake - everyone in fact - raving on about the ROI of Bitcoin 'investments'. TA, buy low sell high, price predictions, lambos etc dominated our feeds and our thoughts.\nWe were duped.\nTHEY (and again, we know who THEY are) fooled us into viewing Bitcoin not as the revolutionary leaderless, censorship/gov resistant, borderless, permissionless and transparent form of exchange this world has NEVER had, but rather just another thing to buy with substanceless, permissioned fake fiat currency to 'get rich'.\nIn short, we all, bitcoiners and nocoiners alike, viewed the whole phenomena from the perspective THEY decided for us.\nNot the perspective we were employing at the time - our perspective, our narrative. We allowed, in our own hearts and minds, OUR narrative to be replaced.\nThen came the divide and conquer - the apparent 'scaling debate'. It took us by surprise. We hurried to study up on it (some more than others) and consequently chose 'our team' without ever realizing it was THEIR idea, this debate.\nTheir 'agreements', their fork, their version of Bitcoin ensued. We got sucked into battling with the gullible few who fell for it and who consequently (and understandably) dug in their heals to defend their erroneous decisions. We got side tracked, again, inTHEIR narrative. It bought them a lot of time and strengthened their successful narrative that made us view this phenomena as a fiat 'investment'.\nGuess what, we are still standing, Bitcoin, the money badger don't care, it's still moving forward. When will we ??\nAre we ready to drop THEIR narrative, THEIR perspective and get on with the revolution yet???\nOur children, grand children etc are still depending on us.", "highlightText": "",

A triple-tier service provides varying levels of privacy, all geared around outsmarting the blockchain forensic tools deployed by companies such as Chainalysis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin's Chance at the $20 Trillion Offshore Tax Haven Market\nBestmixer Ups Its Privacy Game Bitcoin tumbler services and blockchain analysis firms have been engaged in a cat and mouse game, with each trying to outwit the other. Blockchain forensics companies have the full weight of law enforcement behind them and the deep pockets of government funding their bitcoin deanonymizing efforts. Tumbler services, in comparison, have little more than some open source code and a desire to reclaim the privacy that's been gradually eroded from the web over the years, with crypto users among the worst affected.\nBestmixer.io launched in March of this year, and has just issued a major update to its privacy features. Users of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC can feed their coins through the service, with the ones that emerge on the other side promised to be untainted and unlinkable. Platforms such as Chipmixer offer a similar service, which can be accessed from the clearnet or deep web, providing a means of obfuscating activity on darknet markets and anywhere else where privacy is desired.\nBeating Chainalysis at Their Own Game In a post on the Bitcointalk forum , the Bestmixer team announced the introduction of a new module containing reserves for mixing, writing:\nNot so long ago a New York blockchain startup 'Chainalysis' announced the launch of a real-time transaction analysis tool. A new tool called 'Chainalysis KYT' (Know Your Transaction) allows real-time transaction analysis. In particular, the new functionality allows cryptocurrency companies to find out instantly how reliable their counterparty is, and whether it operates with funds that were previously used in illegal financial transactions. In connection with this news, we decided to divide our reserves into three pools, each of which will fulfill its goals.\nThe Alpha, Beta, and Gamma pools offer different degrees of privacy, with the latter two commanding an increased fee commensurate with the cost of maintaining them. Explaining the importance of privacy for all cryptocurrency users, the Bestmixer team said: \"Everyone who has ever participated in a transaction with you has an opportunity to find out the addresses of your wallets, their balances, and can determine the origin of your coins and the destination address. Apart from disclosing the details of your private life, it also makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.\"\nChainalysis have become unavoidable in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to KYC and KYT. Many ideologues regard them as \"enemies of bitcoin\" due to their efforts to deliver cryptocurrency users into the hands of the state that bitcoin was arguably designed to counter. In addition to being used in criminal investigations, Chainalysis is deployed to detect pooling with ICO private sales, something that most ICOs are publicly against but which is rampant. Services such Bestmixer and Chipmixer play a small but vital role in protecting the privacy of those who cherish it the most.\nDo you think bitcoin tumblers can be trusted to thwart forensic services like Chainalysis?

The correlation between bitcoin and the rest of the crypto universe is very high and they mostly seem to move in lockstep.\n(Click to enlarge)\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nYou can call it following the leader. Of course, there are exceptions to this trend, such as when bitcoin losses translate to gains for some cryptos. For instance, alternative protocol assets rallied after the SEC rejected a proposed bitcoin ETF in March. But then, some others, such as Tether, just seem to have a mind of their own.\n(Click to enlarge)\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBut, by and large, bitcoin is the leader in the space while everybody else follows. And that doesn’t make a lot of sense when you consider that every crypto is backed by an independent open-source technology, including the hordes of bitcoin clones.\nThe Ripple Effect\nBut Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, reckons that it’s about time we begin to see the crypto market behaving rationally with various degrees of decoupling between individual cryptos and the top dog.\nGarlinghouse says the nascent industry is still largely driven by speculation mostly because there are so many cryptocurrencies that people don’t understand very well. He claims most cryptos have no real utility, and a massive shakeout will see to it that 99 percent of cryptos won’t be here a decade down the line.\nOf course, he capped it all by claiming that Ripple itself has real utility, and will survive the test of time.\nMaybe the CEO felt the need to talk up his brainchild after the pounding it received during the last crypto sell-off, which led to its XRP token cratering 82 percent from its January all-time high.\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBut what does Ripple do (or claim to do)?\nBlockchain technology can be used to lower costs of money transfers by reducing or eliminating the need for banks to manually settle transactions. Ripple is a blockchain-powered interbank money transfer platform, while XRP is its crypto token. You can think of it as the blockchain equivalent of SWIFT, the leading electronic platform when it comes to interbank money transfers.\nBut what purpose does Ripple serve that SWIFT does not?\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the current banking model whereby liquidity needs are managed via nostro and vostro accounts, which hold trillions of dollars, is highly inefficient. Using digital assets to fund liquidity is a better model, and Ripple is better-positioned to capitalize on it than other cryptos. For instance, the XRP token takes just 3.6 seconds to settle a transaction compared to four hours for bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/sec-shoots-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-bid/", "https://safehaven.com/contributors/Alex-Kimani"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex kimani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rippl", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T19:10:01.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db304dc7cb0b29c1672fac5dcddb0f68c2e93958", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBfb_j7fCeiZD.8AuLXY1GUMBdb5LezVkI_sT1ZBloFAs87kbRBYZ4qFx2T7ijaMxKDnQOJG0EuNio.P0tv.R.J7p50Bsu8o.XDJBT7haJhA--", "site_full": "mrtopstep.com", "site": "mrtopstep.com", "site_section": "http://mrtopstep.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "MrTopStep.com", "title": "Meet Bestmixer, the Bitcoin Tumbler Trying to Outwit Chainalysis", "title_full": "Meet Bestmixer, the Bitcoin Tumbler Trying to Outwit Chainalysis", "published": "2018-06-03T19:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db304dc7cb0b29c1672fac5dcddb0f68c2e93958", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBfb_j7fCeiZD.8AuLXY1GUMBdb5LezVkI_sT1ZBloFAs87kbRBYZ4qFx2T7ijaMxKDnQOJG0EuNio.P0tv.R.J7p50Bsu8o.XDJBT7haJhA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Contributor", "published": "2018-06-03T19:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Meet Bestmixer, the Bitcoin Tumbler Trying to Outwit Chainalysis", "text": "Also read: Bitcoin’s Chance at the $20 Trillion Offshore Tax Haven Market Bestmixer Ups Its Privacy Game\nBitcoin tumbler services and blockchain analysis firms have been engaged in a cat and mouse game, with each trying to outwit the other. Blockchain forensics companies have the full weight of law enforcement behind them and the deep pockets of government funding their bitcoin deanonymizing efforts. Tumbler services, in comparison, have little more than some open source code and a desire to reclaim the privacy that’s been gradually eroded from the web over the years, with crypto users among the worst affected.\nBestmixer.io launched in March of this year, and has just issued a major update to its privacy features. Users of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC can feed their coins through the service, with the ones that emerge on the other side promised to be untainted and unlinkable. Platforms such as Chipmixer offer a similar service, which can be accessed from the clearnet or deep web, providing a means of obfuscating activity on darknet markets and anywhere else where privacy is desired. Beating Chainalysis at Their Own Game\nIn a post on the Bitcointalk forum , the Bestmixer team announced the introduction of a new module containing reserves for mixing, writing:\nNot so long ago a New York blockchain startup ‘Chainalysis’ announced the launch of a real-time transaction analysis tool. A new tool called ‘Chainalysis KYT’ (Know Your Transaction) allows real-time transaction analysis. In particular, the new functionality allows cryptocurrency companies to find out instantly how reliable their counterparty is, and whether it operates with funds that were previously used in illegal financial transactions. In connection with this news, we decided to divide our reserves into three pools, each of which will fulfill its goals.\nThe Alpha, Beta, and Gamma pools offer different degrees of privacy, with the latter two commanding an increased fee commensurate with the cost of maintaining them. Explaining the importance of privacy for all cryptocurrency users, the Bestmixer team said: “Everyone who has ever participated in a transaction with you has an opportunity to find out the addresses of your wallets, their balances, and can determine the origin of your coins and the destination address. Apart from disclosing the details of your private life, it also makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.”\nChainalysis have become unavoidable in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to KYC and KYT. Many ideologues regard them as “enemies of bitcoin” due to their efforts to deliver cryptocurrency users into the hands of the state that bitcoin was arguably designed to counter. In addition to being used in criminal investigations, Chainalysis is deployed to detect pooling with ICO private sales, something that most ICOs are publicly against but which is rampant. Services such Bestmixer and Chipmixer play a small but vital role in protecting the privacy of those who cherish it the most.\nDo you think bitcoin tumblers can be trusted to thwart forensic services like Chainalysis?

big on crypto? The country now has 46 bitcoin ATMs with 10 just being deployed in the Prague subway system. It’s probably good news then that the price of bitcoin has seemed to find a relatively stable triangle on its price volatility to encourage more real world use.

Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs\nLocated in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. Scotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts\nCastle Craig Hospital — Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that “cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency” and that “this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.” The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer “yes” to 5 or more, they likely fall into the “addict” category. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move\nAfter days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside. Op Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading\nIn traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars.\nAtomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled. These “all or nothing” trades preserve atomicity because they either take place or are canceled immediately. Advancing Toward a Decentralized Internet in the Real World\nThe recently aired Season 5 of the popular HBO comedy Silicon Valley features a decentralized internet powered by end-user devices and an internal blockchain-based crypto economy. As usual, the fictional treatment in the show, which has been rightly praised for providing an entertaining but accurate portrait of contemporary tech trends, is based on real developments.

I already have...\nI think not, bitcoin will have trouble reaching 30k this year because the market is very unstable, but for the year 2019 bitcoin seems to be able to reach 30k.\nYes at the moment it doesn't look like that 30k would be a realistic goal.\nImo we are in consolidation phase right now. And who knows for how long we are going to stay here, before the big money decides it's time to go up again.\nI would already be very satisfied with a price between 12-15k at the end of this year. That would be awesome. If we should be able to touch 20k again I would be fine with that as well. But 30k is way too much.\n30.000 USD for bitcoin before the first half of the year end.\nthis is my prediction base on the graph and news about bitcoin.\nalso according to the future projects with bitcoin and investors.\n60.000 USD may reach before the year ends. This is only for me and not 100% but hoping and holding.\nThis is an amazing day because everyone is talking about epic increases in the values of bitcoin which is refreshing my trust into this super currency.\n30,000 dollars is a huge amount and if it would be at 60,000 dollars by the end of December, I dont know how I am going to react and so would be case with many others. I am relieved that people are confident about the amazing end of the year with bitcoin.\nBitcoin is more strengthen than the other crypto coins and is the outshine one among other crypto currencies. This coin has the potential and strength that is going stronger with the passage of time. 30k dollar is nothing in front of Bitcoin once it achieves the demand of people around the globe, the value these days are increasing constantly and this can lead us to a better place higher than that of 30k dollar.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T16:07:25.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f7debb7e572a82f55f2ae949f697b72ce254cfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyfgcsY6PsousaDjbBEzpW3Ln0I1qcBXaR95W5EoSpNwezvtsVgdr6MD7Hj3XiPdFpqtAxQj9kh8brpR1DkNgwfg.Bm20Dw92OvHHcEkQS9g--", "site_full": "kamvreto69.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://kamvreto69.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "everything about bitcoin", "title": "An Upcoming Cryptocurrency Is Trialling a Trio of Bitcoin Tech Advances", "title_full": "An Upcoming Cryptocurrency Is Trialling a Trio of Bitcoin Tech Advances", "published": "2018-06-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f7debb7e572a82f55f2ae949f697b72ce254cfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyfgcsY6PsousaDjbBEzpW3Ln0I1qcBXaR95W5EoSpNwezvtsVgdr6MD7Hj3XiPdFpqtAxQj9kh8brpR1DkNgwfg.Bm20Dw92OvHHcEkQS9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Himen Supritno (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "An Upcoming Cryptocurrency Is Trialling a Trio of Bitcoin Tech Advances", "text": "As grin inches toward launch, the team is incorporating three bold scalability and privacy technologies originally created for bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T08:53:32.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "429aa60492d48a356ee8fe7b991ac09c60456b19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2oREANCqOlaLiwfLB9tBIZe43grn_1L8bg.pt2W7tVaUqJW7fo13iUYr_B0hm9pd7QJnN8Zg7mPFA9.Y_N4hlldL39Zt2I4OcE-", "site_full": "www.juxtapost.com", "site": "juxtapost.com", "site_section": "http://www.juxtapost.com/feed/id/global", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Juxtapost -

The country now has 46 bitcoin ATMs with 10 just being deployed in the Prague subway system. It's probably good news then that the price of bitcoin has seemed to find a relatively stable triangle on its price volatility to encourage more real world use. But it seems that some speculators are starting to suffer from addiction to that volatility. Scotland's largest addiction treatment facility has developed a treatment program for those investors who have maybe gone too far with their enthusiasm and just can't stop.\nCan conventional stock markets take advantage of the concepts of Atomic Swaps that we are seeing developed in the cryptocurrency space? It's all part of the growing trend towards decentralization of everything and removing as many middlemen as possible.\nFeatured stories by Jimmy Aki, Erik Kuebler, Giulio Prisco, Nick Marinoff and Bitcoin Schmitcoin\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here .\nCrypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs Located in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go.\nScotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts Castle Craig Hospital — Scotland's largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that \"cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a 'high' when they buy or trade a winning currency\" and that \"this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.\" The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer \"yes\" to 5 or more, they likely fall into the \"addict\" category.\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move After days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nOp Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading In traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars.\nAtomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled.

The players must have their own cryptocurrency wallets to receive the cryptocurrency.\nFirst Offering Available In August CryptoChips’ first initiative will be in August in “Whimsical War,” a real-time territorial battle game. CryptoChips will distribute bitcoin in accordance with player rankings. In Whimsical War, the placement of characters on the battlefield is key to winning the game. Players can form tag teams and engage in tag team battles.\nCryptoChips, which will be offered through a GMO group company, will be mounted on the group’s other game applications and will eventually include competitors’ game titles.\nMeanwhile, on June 6, the group will launch GMO miner B2, a mining machine equipped with mining chips using a 7 nm process technology.\nA Cryptocurrency Pioneer GMO Internet Group began offering cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency FX in May 2017.\nThe company reported launching its cryptocurrency mining venture in Northern Europe in December, noting that it was utilizing renewable energy that is plentiful in that region. The facility has a production target of 500 petahashes per second.\nIn February, GMO Group announced a two-year rental contract for its cloud mining venture for $5 million to cover power costs, maintenance, land, and security. The operation will support bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The company said it will accept up to eight contracts per month, and that it is considering a less costly alternative mining service.\nEarlier last year, GMO Click, the world’s largest forex broker, announced plans to integrate its trading services with its bitcoin wallet – GMO Wallet Co. Ltd.\nIn 2014, GMO Internet announced it would allow its 48,532 Japanese merchants to accept bitcoin .

The country now has 46 bitcoin ATMs with 10 just being deployed in the Prague subway system. It’s probably good news then that the price of bitcoin has seemed to find a relatively stable triangle on its price volatility to encourage more real world use. But it seems that some speculators are starting to suffer from addiction to that volatility. Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility has developed a treatment program for those investors who have maybe gone too far with their enthusiasm and just can’t stop.\nCan conventional stock markets take advantage of the concepts of Atomic Swaps that we are seeing developed in the cryptocurrency space? It’s all part of the growing trend towards decentralization of everything and removing as many middlemen as possible.\nFeatured stories by Jimmy Aki, Erik Kuebler, Giulio Prisco, Nick Marinoff and Bitcoin Schmitcoin\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs\nLocated in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. Scotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts\nCastle Craig Hospital — Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that “cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency” and that “this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.” The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer “yes” to 5 or more, they likely fall into the “addict” category. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move\nAfter days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside. Op Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading\nIn traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars.\nAtomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled. These “all or nothing” trades preserve atomicity because they either take place or are canceled immediately.

This failure is the result of Visa being a centralized network and highlights the need for decentralized payment systems like Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.\nIn an official statement regarding the incident, Visa said the outage occurred due to a hardware failure, and that the company fell short of its goal of Visa cards working reliably 24 hours a day 365 days a year. According to The Irish Times, there was a major disruption to businesses throughout Ireland as people suddenly found themselves not able to pay bar tabs and restaurant bills. Panic lines formed at ATMs as people tried to withdraw as much cash as possible.\nVisa is the world’s 2nd largest payment processor behind China’s UnionPay and processes in the order of 100 billion transactions per year, worth several trillion USD. A large fraction of the world uses Visa for their payment needs, and it is therefore very important for the economy to have Visa reliable 24/7, and not have any outages like the one that just occurred.\nThe problem with Visa is that it is centralized, payments occur through and are dependent on infrastructure which Visa maintains and controls. A hardware failure is what caused this European outage, and it is possible that more outages could occur due to hardware or software failures in the future.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is decentralized. It exists on every computer that runs the Bitcoin Core program. Currently there are about 10,000 Bitcoin nodes in the world , which are computers that run Bitcoin Core. In order for Bitcoin to have an outage, every single computer running Bitcoin Core in the world would have to go offline.\nThere is no central point of failure for Bitcoin like there is with Visa, so Bitcoin payments work 24/7. Since the genesis block of Bitcoin in 2009 the network has had 99.992% uptime , essentially no downtime at all. It’s summed up in the following tweet. Visa network goes down today.\nBitcoin has never gone down.\nThis makes it clear that Bitcoin is more reliable than Visa as far as uptime is concerned. Decentralized cryptocurrencies are what the world needs for a healthy economy since with well-maintained decentralized payment systems like Bitcoin there are never outages.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews Image Source: Pixabay", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "http://bitcoinist.com/visa-network-crashes-bitcoin-boasts-99-99-uptime-since-genesis-block/", "https://bitnodes.earn.com/", "http://bitcoinuptime.com/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "visa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "irish times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unionpay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T19:05:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6132e9c40ea0055365264a0fea60b6200b0544d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmX90Dx8tzAC9nFsNeWRx9ww-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Could Bitcoin Ever Be Regulated?", "title_full": "Could Bitcoin Ever Be Regulated?", "published": "2018-06-03T18:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6132e9c40ea0055365264a0fea60b6200b0544d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmX90Dx8tzAC9nFsNeWRx9ww-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "meliastor", "published": "2018-06-03T18:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Could Bitcoin Ever Be Regulated?", "text": "Although governments are trying to address the issues that bitcoin poses to them in different ways.

What do you think?", "text": "Twitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink I think there’s a few things that need to happen for cryptocurrencies to become kind of a global replacement for either reserve currencies, global money transfer vis-à-vis like swift wires via your bank.First of all the system needs to be massively liquid. If you think about dollar as a reserve currency, there’s trillions of dollars in circulation. It’s globally liquid across tens of thousands of banks, across 185 countries, et cetera, et cetera. That’s not totally true of cryptocurrencies yet.If you take Bitcoin, which is the most successful cryptocurrency, its market cap is around $200 billion as of today. It’s tradable in 100 plus countries, but the liquidity of bitcoin versus even the U.S. dollar is relatively low, which means it needs to be worth a lot more if it would become let’s say a “digital gold”.Gold is worth trillions of dollars in the aggregate. Bitcoin is not yet worth that much. And that’s important because if it’s not worth trillions of dollars and billions of people want to use it there’s not enough to go around. So you need to be able to break it up into tiny pieces so everyone can use it, just like gold.And that’s not true until it’s worth a lot more money than it is today. But it becomes a circular discussion because the usage will also drive the price higher, just like speculation sometimes can drive the price higher.So over time it should get there by its ability to be fungible with fiat via these exchanges as kind of an onramp into digital currency, but also it should meet the liquidity requirements that we need, meaning the price should be high enough, the ability to get in and out via traditional money should be reasonable globally over the next few years, and then I believe you can really have a viable discussion about using a cryptocurrency like bitcoin as a viable reserve currency.So cryptocurrencies eventually will look like traditional commodities in my opinion, whether it’s gold or platinum or other metals is probably the best. But it could look like oil and gas and things like that.And so they are starting to trade in a fashion that’s more and more similar to traditional commodities. But the difference right now is they’re not as liquid yet. So that means that the price is very inefficient, or the markets for cryptocurrencies are very inefficient.So most people who are holding cryptocurrencies are long term holders, they’re not selling. So that actually means that the price of Bitcoin and Ether, for example, is largely driven by the volume of buyers.So if there’s large volumes of buyers coming into the market it drives the price higher, because there’s not a lot of sellers. But if the buyers dry up then the price goes down regardless, because there’s still not a lot of sellers.So that will change over time because if the price skyrockets – so, for example, if institutional money starts to come into the cryptocurrency market in large numbers—which I think it will—that will force the price higher because there’s not enough cryptocurrency to go around. And that will also cause some of the holders to loosen up their purse strings because they’re going to want to reap the profits that they’ve been waiting for for 10-15 years by the time that happens.And that will also create more liquidity in the system which will create a really positive feedback loop which should drive the price even higher.The other thing that I think is very relevant is you’re starting to see more traditional types of financial products being applied to cryptocurrencies – derivatives, options, nondeliverable forward contracts, things like that that actually will help make the cryptocurrency market more efficient over time, close a lot of what we call arbitrage loopholes which is kind of like free money in the system for traders. And as those loopholes get closed the market becomes more efficient, more liquid, and it becomes better for everyone.This, I think, is a common misunderstanding with how bitcoin works: Bitcoin itself is what we call deflationary, which means that over time the amount of Bitcoin in circulation if you look at a chart would actually approach a fixed value of 21 million – never quite approach it but it will asymptotically in math terms approach that line of 21 million over time. And it does that by the amount of Bitcoin being mined or created being cut in half every so often.

With followers there is a crowd. The masses will naturally divide.\nWith differentiation, there is naturally a blank majority. Naturally, there are evil men who have been swindled. Nature has its center and leadership.\nThis is the history of bitcoin's journey along the way, which is why the BTC creator went to the center to turn the government against the pursuit of liberalism.\nBut on a philosophical basis, technologists are wrong.\nThe beginning of human birth is said to be monkeys. No government, no center. No money, no inflation. Government is not the product of power, but the government itself is the product of liberalism.\nBecause freedom must be evil, freedom itself creates chaos, and chaos leads to the pursuit of order, thus freedom produces power and bad power transition to good power.\nIn the world of BTC, new centralization has begun:\nGlobal mining is concentrated in the hands of a few. The maintenance and development of bitcoin is concentrated in the hands of few digital farmers. The influence of virtual currency is concentrated in the hands of a few big v.\nThey are the new army, the new bureaucracy, the new emperor. Are these people trustworthy?\nThe emergence of BTC is a technological advance in the history of human currency. It makes up for the deficiency of the existing monetary system and should also promote the reform of the existing monetary system.\nLike insurrection, it is either extinguished or assimilated into the long river of history.\nYeah, it really cannot be. Getting that topmost position would be very tough for bitcoin to achieve lots of factors needed to satisfy before reaching that certain level of popularity. Once bitcoin got that position probably the price would stick to a certain and it would be more higher than before, it could possibly break its own phenomenal record wayback last december 2017.

The government has been unable to meet payments since November.\nInflation of over 4000% last year has rendered peoples salaries worthless. Venezuela’s currency, the bolivar, lost 98% of its value in one year reducing it to nothing but paper. Venezuelans are going hungry as widespread panic and looting tears apart what little remains of the civilized society. Hospitals inventories are bare with widespread shortages of medicine.\nVenezuela’s government, in an attempt to move forward through the crisis, launched the world’s first sovereign cryptocurrency, the Petro which the government is hoping to sell USD 2.3 billion worth. The launch wasn’t met with a warm welcome as cryptocurrency enthusiasts where quick to point out the ICO was a tool for the government to continue with its massive corruption and human rights abuses. Donald Trump went as far as issuing an order to stop American investors from taking part in the initial coin offering (ICO) back in March.

The police said that they had just raided his office, they demanded that he hand over USD 15,000 or else they would take his most valuable possessions … his computers that mine cryptocurrencies.” Bloomberg’s Camila Russo and Brad Stone reported .\nTech-savvy locals with access to hardware have been mining cryptocurrencies so that they can exchange them for US dollars. Access to the currency led to police targeting him after receiving a tip-off detailing the operation. The miner went on to explain that due to the judicial system, whether you are innocent or not you may well end up in prison without bail for several months. Due to the uncertainty of the situation in his country, he could not afford to leave his family alone. They decided to gather what little belongings they had and make their way towards the Columbian border.\nThe Venezuelan government has only recently brought in regulation for cryptocurrency mining but the police have been abusing their power to suit their agenda, often harassing and threatening miners in order to unjustifiably seize any money they can. A short-term solution to Venezuela’s economic crisis will need to be negotiated, international aid can provide food and medical supplies whilst reforms are implemented so that the country can begin to stabilize again.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Police Tried Stealing $15,000 From a Venezuelan Bitcoin Miner appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

And the price also affects altcoins.\nThe price did drop from almost 20K to 6K in in February, but hopefully it will rise again and reach 20K again at the end of the year.\nIn short, many factors affect the rise and fall of bitcoin's market price so we can't tell which specifically is causing the dump. Though the whales is not active now, factors like negativity and bad image are affecting bitcoin badly. The internet is flooded by bad news about bitcoin being a scam when the truth is, bitcoin is being used by fake investments companies. Some people are also selling because of giving up, it had been a long wait for bitcoin to rise again and those people are not happy holding anymore.\nPrice is at dump and will only shows small recovery and then will fall again.

This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief. Also Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App Poloniex Responds to Complaints On Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone. McAfee Warns of War on Crypto John McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore) The big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold. McAfee also also talked about “the war we are all engaged in”, Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” China Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters A couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator’s office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ’s love for crypto. Asus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Asus H370 Mining Master On Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin. Expanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia Countries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. “I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia. Blockchain on the Agenda in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary Governments all across Europe were our focus on Saturday . Lawmakers in Spain have issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. The government of Slovenia has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in the country and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).

You first copy paste the long string of letters and numbers, then double check five times to make sure you don’t send it to the wrong address and gift a random stranger with a nice weekend present. The all-too-familiar problem of Bitcoin address format is now being challenged by a simple solution: human-readable addresses. “One of the main problems facing mass adoption of cryptocurrency usage is the difficult nature of making token transactions,” says Isabella Dell, Founder, and CTO of IOV (Internet of Value) . “When it comes to actual end-users, blockchain platforms have failed to solve the user experience problem around wallet addresses in particular.” G lobal Decentralized Blockchain Address Registry IOV has created a blockchain name service application (BNS) that allows users to input their public keys and register a human-readable value address. Essentially IOV envisions addresses changing from this: 28fh17fvY9Co2kja9fl24DbFX57j803gw5 To this: john*iov.value These new addresses will be shorter and easier to manage for non-technical people getting into the crypto space as they look similar to email addresses, which everyone is already familiar with. Blockchain Wallet Interoperability IOV plans to make things even easier for cryptocurrency adopters by solving the problem of Blockchain wallet interoperability (managing multiple cryptocurrencies across different Blockchains). The majority of Blockchains currently exist in silos, where you can only interact within a blockchain ecosystem by sending your cryptocurrencies to a centralized exchange, trading them for another coin, and then sending those funds to a new wallet that supports said coin. This process usually requires at least three transactions, which means more fees, time, as well as greater risk of human error. Using cross-chain atomic swaps , IOV aims to make the movement of funds from one blockchain to the next a truly peer-to-peer experience. “With a cross-chain atomic swap, we actually have the transactions in the chains, yet they are only claimable by the two parties,” Dell explained. During the process of claiming the tokens, certain information is revealed that allows the other party to claim the transaction. Throughout this process, the middleman is removed and the chain becomes the escrow, so crypto holders don’t have to give coins to an exchange or someone they don’t trust. Ahead of the Curve IOV’s impressive work earned them first place at this years TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield Europe event. By introducing BNS and cross chain atomic swaps, the team is laying the foundation for a future where thousands of currencies that each serve a unique purpose within their ecosystem will exist, and people will be free to switch between cryptocurrencies as seamlessly as we can currently switch between browser tabs.

Despite the issue being reportedly resolved, the incident serves to highlight the need for decentralized, stable alternatives where possibilities of the kind are simply non-existent. In an official statement on Twitter, Visa announced that their payment processing service is experiencing a “service disruption”: We are currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. We are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. We will keep you updated. — VisaNewsEurope (@VisaNewsEurope) June 1, 2018 Reportedly , Visa users were experiencing serious issues with their card payments. They were receiving messages stating that there was a “disruption of service,” preventing providers receiving or sending money. Major Red Flag Credit card payments weren’t the only service impacted by the Visa outage. The issue also prevented many European customers from transacting with cash deposited in their bank accounts. The Irish Times reported that Irish tourists as far away as the US were unable to access their money. Personal hassles aside, the outage could have triggered major issues for banking institutions as well. Reports began emerging of people lining up in front of ATMs to withdraw as much cash as possible for fear of a prolonged outage. Banks like HSBC started tweeting about the problem almost immediately: We are aware of an industry wide issue affecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and MasterCard transactions are not impacted. Visa are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will continue to support our impacted customers as needed. — HSBC UK (@HSBC_UK) June 1, 2018 Current Problem Resolved, Underlying Issues Remain Earlier today, almost 20 hours after Visa first acknowledged the outage, the company posted an announcement on their website, claiming that the issue had been resolved: Visa Europe’s payment system is now operating at full capacity, and Visa account holders can now use Visa for any of their purchases and at ATMs, as they normally would. Yet, a certain point needs to be stressed. Visa is one of the leading payment solutions providers, with millions of people using its services around the world. While it’s unclear how many of those customers were affected by the problem, one thing is clear – a problem with a single, centralized service provider can potentially leave millions of people unbanked. Can Crypto Provide an Answer? In the official announcement, Visa explained that the outage was caused by some sort of “system failure.” The question here is – can we afford to let a “system” and its support team determine whether millions of people across the world will have access to their money? The problem is much larger than Visa, of course, but this particular incident clearly outlines the need for an alternative – like Bitcoin – that is immune to such “system failures.” Decentralization could well solve all of these problems and, ironically, Visa is no stranger to the technology. In October 2016, Visa announced that it was working on a blockchain-based solution for cross-border, business-to-business exchange. Similarly, just this past month, MasterCard filed a patent for faster node verification system. Could all of this be hinting that we are closer to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology? Amid all of the chaos caused by Visa’s outage, one simple truth emerged: Visa network goes down today. Bitcoin has never gone down. — Bitcoin (@btc) June 1, 2018 Do you think decentralization is the solution that major payment processors and card issuers are in need of?
