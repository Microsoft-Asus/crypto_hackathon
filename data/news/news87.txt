It‚Äôs currently trading in a range from $7,330 to $7,350.\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is on another bearish run, testing a support of $7,300. However, the cryptocurrency is showing positive signs against the 100-day moving average, facing a barrier of $7,500 to $7,600. BTC/USD On New Bearish Run\nFollowing the recent price actions, BTC/USD is now on a new bearish run toward a major support of $7,300. The trading volume spike indicates that a minor selloff occurred in the past couple hours.\nHowever, buyers succeeded in pushing the price back near the $7,350 level, which may result in a reversal toward a major resistance point of $7,550. A short-term bullish reversal will be confirmed if Bitcoin breaks past the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average hurdle.\nOn the upside, buyers must push the price above the resistance level for more near-term gains. A movement past $7,600 could take BTC/USD further up toward $8,000 later this week. On the downside, a break below $7,330 may push BTC/USD toward the other direction to the $7,200 level. Source: Tradingview\nLooking at the technicals chart, BTC/USD is currently on a bearish run as indicated by the MACD line crossover.

It covers class 25 (clothing), class 32 (beverages) and class 33 (wine).\nA search for EU trademarks shows more results.\nOne is the trademark originally filed in 2011 by MtGox and now owned by the Japanese exchange ‚ÄúBitflyer‚Äù. This trademark covers: Software for commerce over a global communications network.Electronic commerce services, namely providing information about products via telecommunication networks for advertising and sales purposes.Signal transmission for electronic commerce via telecommunication systems and data communication systems.Constructing an internet platform for electronic commerce.\nAnother recent example is a trademark ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù registered on April 4th of this year for group 30, which is for all sorts of candy.\nIn contrast, if you search with ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù or ‚ÄúCoca-Cola‚Äù, you will find no trademarks registered by third parties for clothing or wine.\nThat‚Äôs because if anyone attempts to register such a trademark, Google or Coca-Cola will oppose the registration and stop it under Article 8 Paragraph 5 of the trademark Regulation 2017/1001 . This prevents registration of a trademark that is identical to another trademark that ‚Äúhas a reputation in the Union‚Äù.\nThere are two reasons for this.\nOne is that it would be unfair to Google if anybody could just go ahead and dilute their trademark.\nThe other is that it would be unfair to give anyone an exclusive right to a valuable name when they had no part in the effort to create the value in the first place.\nWith Bitcoin, the first aspect doesn‚Äôt come into play. By design, there is no entity like Google owning the name Bitcoin. That also means that there is nobody who can oppose registration of a ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù trademark for candy.\nBut the second aspect is valid with Bitcoin as well. The German company Katjes, which has registered the Bitcoin candy trademark, had no part in the effort needed to develop Bitcoin to a $125 billion marketcap at the time of this writing. They are free-riding on the efforts of others.\nWhich would not be a big problem if they didn‚Äôt attempt to create an exclusive right for themselves. This is not possible with copyright. The open source license Bitcoin is built on makes sure that no one involved can claim any exclusive copyright on Bitcoin software. It is also not possible with patents. If you try to patent the concept of ‚Äúproof of work‚Äù, you should be blocked from doing so by the simple fact that this concept is public knowledge since January 3rd 2009.\nI think there should be some way to stop people from registering copyrights for Bitcoin candy and free-riding on the good will created by others.\nBut I don‚Äôt see any such way in the existing Regulation.\nThe closest parallel I could find would be the absolute ground for registration refusal in Article 7 Paragraph 1 (h), which stops people from registering a trademark ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù for candy, or the colors of the German flag.\nJust like Bitcoin, this is just a public interest. And just like Bitcoin, candy makers should be stopped from creating an exclusive right in a word (Germany) that has achieved fame based on something different from their own efforts.\nHowever, there is no such ground for refusal right now for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù.\nThat means two things.\nFor one, every immoral actor around can race other sleazy scumbags to get a piece of the action. There are lots of goods where using the famous ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù phrase might make sense for marketing purposes. Whoever gets his registration first will profit from the fame created by others.\nAnd in the longer term, the Regulation should be changed and terms that ‚Äúhave a reputation in the Union‚Äù should be off limits for registration, even if there is no trademark owner of them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/010103646", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m35ox/a_uk_company_has_trademarked_the_word_bitcoin/", "https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017587957", "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R1001", "https://imgur.com/a/JTBZKui", "https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003279106"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karl-friedrich lenz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T07:36:48.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aae603027855e63320736ca9cf742fd0a3f9af1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaYCiElVFyFVYc7GLp1qmDP08xOK2m8LiPUHyr5dugXenhSIl1eNKGkXISaixxQzkS58uDcPCNnnWHujVJ4mDwwXkyvuPGDekovg9W3HtOKg--", "site_full": "mukiditrading.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://mukiditrading.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mukidi Trading", "title": "Follow CryptoDenz and Bitcoin User on Twitter!", "title_full": "Follow CryptoDenz and Bitcoin User on Twitter!", "published": "2018-05-31T04:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aae603027855e63320736ca9cf742fd0a3f9af1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaYCiElVFyFVYc7GLp1qmDP08xOK2m8LiPUHyr5dugXenhSIl1eNKGkXISaixxQzkS58uDcPCNnnWHujVJ4mDwwXkyvuPGDekovg9W3HtOKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pemprov DKI Jakarta (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T04:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Follow CryptoDenz and Bitcoin User on Twitter!", "text": "Bitcoin User also Tweeted. 16 Who to follow wregrgb08 and 2 others followed CryptoDenz @CryptoDenz Follow 850 Following 560 Followers Redcoin and 2 others followed Bitcoin User @BitcoinTamilson Follow I don't use drugs, I use #bitcoins #etherium #BTC #ETH #Cryptocurrency 4.5K Following 5K Followers Help | Reset password | Download app We sent this email to @MukidiTrading.

Every transaction is available for everyone to see and break down very easily. I think that the open nature of Bitcoin is exactly what is working in its favor on all grounds. Even privacy isn't a thing, especially not with how people are forced to verify themselves at the exchange they purchase coins from. The privacy aspect might have had some traction back in the early non regulation days, but every small bit of privacy is no longer of importance.

A red room is basically a live feed where people either get tortured, raped or killed or all of the above in highly perversive ways. Usually the viewers will have to pay a price to watch. Some also speculate that, for a price, viewers can act as the \"director\" of the red room, and tell the torturer exactly what to do to the victim.\nAlthough the details of red rooms aren't exactly proven. But something called ¬ìDaisy's Destruction¬î where a man(Peter Scully) would supposedly have a live feed of children as young as two years old being tortured, assaulted, and in some cases, murdered(supposedly) by Scully and various accomplices. Luckily Scully is in prison now, but that actually happened, although as many people know most of the details are exaggerated or aren't fully proven but I still wouldn't doubt there to be more of these ¬ëred room¬í type sites. Jadi intinya di sana \" RED ROOM \" kayak sebuah tempat streming dimana orang-orang disiksa, diperkosa atau dibunuh atau semua hal di atas dengan cara yang sangat Mengerikan . dan jika ingin menonton kita harus bersedia membayar 0.2 Bitcoin dan jika ingin menjadi orang yang menyiksa korban harus bersedia membayar 1 bitcoin.\nBeginilah tampilan awalan salah satu webside:\nDan jika anda punya nyali bisa ke salah satu webside http://redroo4tg5znuux7.onion/ <~~~", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.quora.com/The-Internet-What-is-the-worst-thing-on-the-deep-web-that-was-proven-to-be-real/answer/Elijah-Chique#", "http://redroo4tg5znuux7.onion/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:55:29.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29f0d7b74a0a5fb0feb9c8f00d3db04ac64996f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaX.673zK.oVgnUDq4wVLV2jBtiDYdSaFwV1IG4QN2DA_vGuqnPWFhSM8XtntO622vQMfK1VSGTHnWSRzYybljKA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "Attention: this headline allegedly under investigation for Bitcoin market manipulation - Crypto Insider", "title_full": "Attention: this headline allegedly under investigation for Bitcoin market manipulation - Crypto Insider : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-31T04:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29f0d7b74a0a5fb0feb9c8f00d3db04ac64996f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaX.673zK.oVgnUDq4wVLV2jBtiDYdSaFwV1IG4QN2DA_vGuqnPWFhSM8XtntO622vQMfK1VSGTHnWSRzYybljKA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "toadlyBroodle", "published": "2018-05-31T04:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Attention: this headline allegedly under investigation for Bitcoin market manipulation - Crypto Insider", "text": "submitted by /u/toadlyBroodle\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/attention-headline-allegedly-investigation-bitcoin-market-manipulation/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T23:19:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d41c8abfaf23f096ea37755859c970caa4b1fb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgS49QFpViv2wrj2lXBe0JSt4NwFLYtLimwxSiR3DWvfYkbsoNupbRuYw9NWoxuRLOoqbkr7FpJRoMmpj05jAiIWQ--", "site_full": "www.watchlistnews.com", "site": "watchlistnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchlistnews.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Watch List News", "title": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Market Cap Tops $58,697.00", "title_full": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Market Cap Tops $58,697.00", "published": "2018-05-31T04:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1248.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d41c8abfaf23f096ea37755859c970caa4b1fb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgS49QFpViv2wrj2lXBe0JSt4NwFLYtLimwxSiR3DWvfYkbsoNupbRuYw9NWoxuRLOoqbkr7FpJRoMmpj05jAiIWQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark Dietrich", "published": "2018-05-31T04:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Market Cap Tops $58,697.00", "text": "Tweet\nBitcoin 21 (CURRENCY:XBTC21) traded up 0.7% against the dollar during the 24 hour period ending at 21:00 PM Eastern on May 30th.

Seriously, for the first 5-8 years, the digital currency was mainly used as a means for criminals to launder money and sell illegal goods on the dark market. Think of all the massive hacks in the early days also, and all those darknet markets that disappeared with huge amounts of bitcoin.\nLiterally millions and millions of the 16 million coins out there would be owned by criminals. And now with bitcoin becoming more centralized and less anonymous, they are swiftly exiting the market and looking for alternative dark coins.\nI also personally avoid using bitcoin all-together because of the extremely slow transaction speeds and high cost's associated with it.\nThe bitcoin mining business is dust, so that interest will die quickly.\nI just don't see a very bright future for the god of cryptocurrency and it will surely be surpassed by one of its rivals soon enough.\nI'm torn between predicting it to be Dash, or Ethereum, and I recon it could be about 2 years before that happens.\nWould love to know peoples thoughts on the future of bitcoin.\nWhere will bitcoin be in\n2 weeks?\n2 months?\n2 years?\nWill it be surpassed by another coin? If so, which one and when?\nThere are a lot of factors to consider whether bitcoin can still continue on top like the impact of new users and the adaptation of the remaining companies to bitcoin and the whole industry of cryptocurrency.

views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nA prominent economist, author of ‚ÄúWhen Markets Collide,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Only Game in Town‚Äù Mohamed El-Erian thinks cryptocurrency is the future and that it will be government-backed.\nWe believe that most top digital currencies will survive this bear market and the traders should view the current fall as a buying opportunity instead of fearing it.\nSygnia Asset Management, a major South African investment firm with $14.5 billion under management, is launching a cryptocurrency exchange in late 2018. It will also create a fund to invest in digital currencies on behalf of its clients.\nSo, should we also start investing at the current levels or wait a little more? Let‚Äôs find out.\nBTC/USD We are clear that Bitcoin can be purchased on dips because it offers a great risk to reward ratio if purchased anywhere between $6,075 to $7,000. We believe that it is in consolidation, as long as it stays above $6,075. A break of this level will be negative and will attract further selling.\nWe had recommended buying the leading cryptocurrency on a sharp fall below $7,000 in our previous analysis, but the bulls held on to the $7,100 levels on May 28 and May 29.\nThe current rebound will face resistance at the downtrend line and above that at the 20-day EMA, which is at $7,963.\nThe BTC/USD pair has given a tradeable bounce from close to the 30 levels on the RSI for the past year and a half. Until proven otherwise, we believe that this trend will continue.\nThe next dip from the overhead resistances will offer us a buying opportunity. It is advisable to watch for a couple of days before initiating a long position.\nETH/USD Ethereum broke below the support line of the descending channel on May 28, but the bears could not follow up on their selling at lower levels. As a result, the digital currency rebounded sharply on the very next day, erasing all the losses.\nThe rebound will face selling at higher levels as the 20-day EMA has turned down and has completed a bearish crossover.\nThe next dip will give us a better idea whether the decline has ended at $492.5 on May 28 or will it extend to $464.65 levels.\nOnce we get a confirmation of a bottom, we shall recommend long positions on the ETH/USD pair. Currently, we don‚Äôt find any trade on it.\nXRP/USD Ripple has formed a large descending triangle pattern. It broke below the critical $0.56270 support on May 28 but rebounded on the next day. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, which has turned down.\nIf the next dip holds above $0.54, the traders can wait for a break out above the 20-day EMA to go long. The minimum upside target objective of such a trade is a move back to $0.8. We can expect a rally to $1.2 if the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle.\nIf the $0.54 level breaks, a fall to $0.45 is likely. This is the last support, below which the digital currency can sink to $0.24.\nBCH/USD We believe that Bitcoin Cash is trading in a range whose resistance is at $1,600. The support of the range is still undecided. It can either be $750 or closer to $620.\nCurrently, the cryptocurrency is struggling to sustain above the downtrend line. If the bears succeed in breaking below the May 28 lows of $878, a slide to $750 is probable. This should offer some support, but if this also breaks, the next support is at $620.\nIf the $878 level holds, the BCH/USD pair can remain range bound for a few days. We don‚Äôt find any reliable buy setups at the current levels; hence, we are not recommending any trade on it.\nEOS/USD We had proposed a buy at $14.25 on EOS, but it turned down from $12.98 on May 28. The 20-day EMA is currently acting as strong resistance.\nThe EOS/USD pair can remain range bound between $10.3384-$12.9870 for the next few days, before breaking out or breaking down from it.\nWe don‚Äôt find any buy setup as long as prices remain inside the range. If the virtual currency breaks down of the range, it will become very negative, hence, we suggest waiting for the break out to close (UTC) above $12.98 to form any long positions.\nLTC/USD Litecoin has held the $107 support levels once again, but it is facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will face resistance at the 20-day EMA at $129.\nWe shall consider a buy only after the LTC/USD pair sustains above $129 for a couple of days.\nOn the downside, if the $107 level breaks, it will signal the completion of a descending triangle pattern. Though its pattern targets are way lower, the digital currency can slide to $84 and below that to $75.\nADA/USD Cardano is showing buying at lower levels. It has broken out of the descending channel and is moving towards the overhead resistance at $0.23. If the bulls break out of this, the cryptocurrency will gain strength and pick up momentum on crossing above $0.3.\nWe like the way the ADA/USD pair bounced from the oversold levels on the RSI. This shows that bulls are willing to enter at lower levels.\nWe recommend a long position on a breakout and close (UTC) above $0.23 with the stops below $0.17. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency fails to break out of $0.23 and turns down, breaking below $0.17.\nXLM/USD The wedge pattern did not give us a clear breakout or a breakdown. Hence, we have removed it today. Stellar pulled back sharply from 0.2428 levels on May 29 but is facing selling close to $0.30 levels.\nIf the bulls can scale above the $0.303 levels, it will indicate the start of a rally to $0.385. Therefore, traders should wait for the breakout and close (UTC) above $0.303 before initiating any long positions.\nIf the XLM/USD pair fails to hold the current levels and breaks down to $0.24, it can slide to the next lower support at $0.184.\nIOTA/USD After a sharp pullback on May 29, IOTA has climbed to the ninth spot, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs way back in our analysis. It continues to consolidate between $0.9150-$2.2117.\nCurrently, the price is close to the overhead resistance at $1.63. The 20-day EMA is also just above it. We believe that the bulls will find it difficult to break out of these two resistances.\nWe anticipate a retest of the recent lows of $1.33 in a couple of days. If the lows hold, the traders can buy a breakout and close above $1.63 with a target of $2.2.\nIf the lows break, the IOTA/USD pair will decline to the bottom of the range at $1.

Data from Blockchain republished on Twitter by trader and commentator CryptoYoda impressed users, with theories including miners mining at a smaller profit in order to generate long-term holdings.\nThat theory echoes research presented last month suggesting Bitcoin could be at the start of another protracted 'HODL' period.\nin the meanwhile‚Ä¶\no Bitcoin Fee at its Cheapest\no SegWit Adoption Rises to All-Time High\no Hashrate Steadily Climbing pic.twitter.com/DUtwJJL6PN\n‚Äî CryptoYoda (@CryptoYoda1338) May 28, 2018\nBanks Lastly, banking failures dominate the headlines this week, with Italy and the eurozone under political pressure and Australia and New Zealand lenders both suffering mass technical outages which cut customers off from their funds.\nAs Reuters reported May 26, National Australia Bank and the Bank of New Zealand were initially unable to confirm whether the problems were related or a coincidence.

Laszlo Hanyecz, a developer who worked on bitcoin early on, told Business Insider he exchanged hundreds of emails with the person or team known as Nakamoto in 2010. The experience was mostly weird, Hanyecz said. Ten years after murmurs of the world's first cryptocurrency appeared online, there's still no definitive clue as to the identity of its creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWhile Nakamoto vanished from the internet in April 2011, the cryptocurrency creator left behind a slender trail of breadcrumbs in the form of emails exchanged with early bitcoin developers, commentary in online forums, and bitcoin's original white paper.\nWhile there's plenty of speculation regarding Nakamoto's identity, all the guesses hazarded thus far have led to inconclusive dead ends.\nOne bitcoin developer, Laszlo Hanyecz, best known for making the first real-world purchase in bitcoin for a pair of pizzas , told Business Insider he exchanged hundreds of emails with the bitcoin creator in 2010.\nTheir interaction began when Hanyecz, who had been mining bitcoins on his laptop, expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency's development online. Nakamoto agreed, Hanyecz said, and over the course of the year, Nakamoto sent tasks for Hanyecz to complete.\nHanyecz said his interactions with Nakamoto were always \"kind of weird.\"\nbitcoin More Reuters/Dado Ruvic \"I thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,\" Hanyecz said. \"Nakamoto would send me emails like 'Hey, can you fix this bug?' 'Hey, can you do this?'\"\nHanyecz said that even though his work on bitcoin was a side project he worked on for free, Nakamoto treated him as if he were a full-time employee.\n\"He'd say, 'Hey, the west side's down,' or 'We have these bugs ‚Äî we need to fix this.' I'd be like, we? We're not a team,\" Hanyecz said. \"I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn't want the responsibility.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, evaporated from the web seven years ago. Laszlo Hanyecz, a developer who worked on bitcoin early on, told Business Insider that he exchanged hundreds of emails with the person known as Nakamoto over the course of 2010. The experience was mostly weird, said Hanyecz.\nTen years after murmurs of the world's first cryptocurrency appeared online, there's still no definitive clue as to the identity of its creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWhile Nakamoto vanished from the internet in April of 2011, he left behind a slender trail of breadcrumbs in the form of emails exchanged with early bitcoin developers, commentary in online forums, and bitcoin's original whitepaper itself. While there's plenty of speculation regarding Nakamoto's true identity, all of the guesses hazarded thus far have led to inconclusive dead ends.\nOne bitcoin developer, Laszlo Hanyecz , best known for making the first real-world purchase in bitcoin for a pair of multi-million dollar pizzas , told Business Insider that he exchanged hundreds of emails with the bitcoin creator over the course of 2010.\nTheir interaction began when Hanyecz, who had been mining bitcoins on his laptop, expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency's development online. Nakamoto agreed, Hanyecz said, and over the course of the year, he sent over tasks for Hanyecz to complete.\nHanyecz said that his interactions with Nakamoto were always \"kind of weird.\" Reuters/Dado Ruvic A small toy figure is seen on representations of the Bitcoin virtual currency in this illustration picture, December 26, 2017. \"I thought bitcoin was awesome and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,\" said Hanyecz. \"Nakamoto would send me emails like, 'Hey, can you fix this bug? Hey, can you do this?'\"\nHanyecz said that even though his work on bitcoin was a side project that he worked on for free, Nakamoto treated him like he was a full time employee. \"He'd say: 'Hey, the west side's down.' Or, 'We have these bugs, we need to fix this.' I'd be like, 'We? We're not a team,'\" said Hanyecz. \"I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn't want the responsibility. I didn't really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.\"\nHanyecz said that Nakamoto's demands occasionally rubbed him the wrong way.\n\"I'd say, 'Hey, you're not my boss,'\" said Hanyecz. \"I didn't take it too seriously, though.\" I asked a few questions - he always dodged them\nNakamoto didn't seem too thrilled about Hanyecz's burgeoning mining pursuits either, said Hanyecz.\n\"He said, \"Well, I'd rather not have you do the mining too much,'\" said Hanyecz. \"He was trying to grow the community and get more commerce-use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.\"\nTypically, Hanyecz would contact Nakamoto throughout the week with technical inquiries usually related to bitcoin's code, he said. When Nakamoto chose to respond, he'd do so all at once, usually towards the end of the week.\n\"I just assumed he was busy working on other stuff,\" said Hanyecz. Kim Kyung Hoon/Reuters Despite working on a strenuous, highly technical project together, Hanyecz said that Nakamoto always maintained his veil of anonymity, to the point that it struck Hanyecz as distinctly odd. \"He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal,\" said Hanyecz. \"I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.\"\nBecause of Nakamoto's name, Hanyecz assumed like many others, that he was conferring with a slightly eccentric man of Asian origins. There were several emails where Hanyecz said that Nakamoto struck him as paranoid.\n\"There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base,\" he said. \"I brushed them off because I was like, 'Who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away?' This wasn't my job or anything, it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it 'pre-release,' and I was helping him get it to release.\"\nIn retrospect, Hanyecz said that Nakamoto's paranoia was understandable.\n\"I f anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn't be heaving this conversation today,\" he said.\nHanyecz said that he's used to dealing with eccentric people over the internet, but that his interactions with Nakamoto consistently gave him what he called \"a weird feeling.\"\nUltimately, though, Hanyecz said that he has deep respect for both Nakamoto's project and the person, or team, behind the name Nakamoto. Hanyecz believes that bitcoin might not exist today if it wasn't for its creator's decision to evade the public eye.\n\" It's exciting because people love a man of mystery, but I try to steer people towards the fact that it doesn't matter who made it. He could be a psycho killer,\" Hanyecz said. \" People like to identify with heroes or villains, but in the cryptosphere your code has to speak for itself. Charisma and being an interesting person only gets you so far when you're a developer. Ultimately, you'll be judged on the quality of your code and your idea.\" Get the latest Bitcoin price here.>> ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "laszlo hanye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "temple city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T22:39:14.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "534e39c06c61f05c54879fc518f2c5141d9c0705", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9AqVdLrzeJaDw--", "site_full": "www.carigold.com", "site": "carigold.com", "site_section": "http://www.carigold.com/portal/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=145", "site_categories": ["investing", "non_standard_content", "finance", "adult"], "section_title": "Get-Paid-To Programmes -

Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.\nLos Angeles, CA (May 30, 2018) ‚Äî mesmr‚Ñ¢, the blockchain-based new media ecosystem, is announcing the creation of mesmr.tv, a media platform designed for content creators and their audiences.\n‚Äúmesmr was formed due to a lack of trust in today‚Äôs new media platforms. Our goal is to give everyone the power to unleash their creativity, own the rights to their personal data and to leverage the transparency of blockchain, giving brands a visible ROI on their marketing spend. We‚Äôre building a consumer-centric blockchain in the hopes that we can bring everyone into the world‚Äôs new operating system that is blockchain technology,‚Äù Dil-Domin√© Leonares, mesmr founder and CEO stated.\nThe announcement comes in the midst of calls by content creators to revisit how the modern media platform manages revenue and access to content. With a unique token-based system, mesmr rewards all three parties‚Äîcreators, audiences, and brands‚Äîfor their participation on the platform.\n‚ÄúOne of our goals is to drive mass adoption of blockchain technology by making everything very user friendly,‚Äù added Val Kantchev, mesmr‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer. ‚ÄúA lot follows from that user focus, including also the decision to build our own blockchain network.‚Äù\nmesmr.tv rewards all participants for their engagement in the ecosystem. Based on their belief in on-demand income, mesmr.tv will be giving viewers tokens for their time spent watching ads, should the consumer choose to opt-in for this feature. In addition, they want to give them the option to either keep their data private or release it to advertisers for a fee. Their goal is to spur the adoption of blockchain by creating a platform that provides all the benefits of a token, without sacrificing user experience like other content sharing platforms in the blockchain industry.\nThe company is aiming to create a ‚Äúcontent democracy‚Äù, where videos succeed or fail based on merit, not how well they fit into advertiser-friendly guidelines. The community decides what rises to the top. Creators receive 80% of the advertising revenue generated from their content, and community members can gain extra tokens for sharing content that performs well.\nOver the next few weeks, mesmr will be rolling out their TGE (Token Generation Event) with a pre-sale set for June 15th. Allowing purchase of the mesmr token (MSMR) with Ethereum (ETH), they are expecting to generate over 350 million tokens with a value of $200 million USD.\nTo learn more about mesmr, you can visit their website mesmr.tv or view their whitepaper available here .\nAbout mesmr: Founded in 2017, mesmr is committed to creating a secure media ecosystem powered entirely by blockchain. The soon-to-be-released, mesmr blockchain will be powered by the Proof of Influence consensus protocol solving the unfairness of PoS (Proof of Stake) and the sustainability issues of PoW (Proof of Work). mesmr.tv is the first proof of concept that runs on the mesmr blockchain and utilizes the influence score.\nContact Email Address www.mesmr.tv\nThis is a paid press release.

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat‚Äôs on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we‚Äôve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China. They can also be followed through Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and Wechat accounts.

As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) ‚Äî most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward ‚Äî this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting: The red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply. Vice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market. Points 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000‚Äì$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It‚Äôs impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait. Summary: The market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move. There is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. Symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

So far, consumers and corporations have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrency. It seems that situation may come to change fairly soon. Local sources indicate the government is confiscating any hardware related to cryptocurrency mining. The Bitcoin Situation in Venezuela\nOver the past few years, the financial turmoil in Venezuela has become more apparent. Its national currency is losing value fairly quickly. This has caused many different issues for both corporations and consumers alike. It seems even the issuance of the Petro cryptocurrency may not necessarily improve this situation anytime soon.\nDesperate times often call for desperate measures. In the case of Venezuela, citizens are flocking to cryptocurrency mining. Given the rising value of Bitcoin, mining this currency has become more popular. As a result of the country‚Äôs access to cheaper electricity, mining Bitcoins seemingly makes perfect sense.\nAt the same time, this type of activity has also received a lot of negative attention. The Venezuelan government officially subsidizes all electricity in the country. Anyone using this resource to mine Bitcoin has become a target for legal repercussions. Various mining operations have been shut down in the past. It now appears this situation will only grow worse as more time progresses. The Government Intervenes Yet Again\nAccording to local outlet Noticiero Digital , things are not evolving in a positive direction. In fact, the Venezuelan government is confiscating any shipments related to cryptocurrency mining. This applies specifically to hardware being imported from other parts of the world. It is another crackdown on Bitcoin mining, albeit a very aggressive countermeasure.\nCourier services have informed clients this measure has been implemented recently. As such, users are advised not to order any Bitcoin mining hardware outside of Venezuela. That creates a big problem, as buying or selling this equipment in the country itself is difficult, if not impossible.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the reasoning behind this development is. Government spokespeople have not issued any official comment regarding this statement. As such, it remains unclear what the officials hope to achieve by taking this drastic approach. At this stage, it seems any cryptocurrency equipment will be confiscated. In the past, harsh action was taking against ASIC units. The new development puts GPUs, motherboards, and even power supplies at risk of confiscation as well. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Course of treatment based on cryptocurrency-based therapies from gambling.\nThe crypto addict course will run along similar lines to the gambling treatment course now offered by the medical facility, incorporating the treatment of associated mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and sex addiction.\nReports have shown that like online gambling, cryptocurrency traders can just as well become chronic addicts to digital currency trading like bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies as many are consumed with the tracking of every price move in the market.\n'It provides excitement and an escape from reality. According to healthcare experts, people can get addicted to crypto trading and that addicts in such cases are dependent on keeping track of the daily changes in the market value of their traded tokens. A member of Bitcoin Pub, a cryptocurrency forum, openly admitted that his addiction to crypto trading may be unhealthy. They can choose any addiction they want, and it can be cryptocurrencies , but that doesn't mean that a majority of cryptocurrency traders are addicts. \"It's a classic bubble situation \", gambling therapist Chris Burn said.\nSome treatments at the centre will be led by Tony Marini , a former gambling and cocaine addict. Castle Craig said there were no figures for the number of people addicted to cryptocurrency , but there are about... The first stage of this course are group sessions in which people share experiences and realise they are not alone faced with a similar problem. Mr. Marini has told media that having experienced it himself, he has \"insight and empathy\" towards people who are struggling with the same or similar issues. The primary difference would seem to be that cryptocurrencies are newer and more poorly understood.

He made this prediction during a recent televised chat with CNBC . The 2013 Nobel Prize winner in Economics listed some scenarios that could prove fatal for the number one cryptocurrency. Despite his prediction, the prominent economist noted that it was hard to know the future of cryptocurrency with any certainty. Mainstream investors like Warren Buffet and Charlie have sounded the death knell for BTC on many occasions. Buffet once declared that the entire cryptocurrency market would come to a bad end. Too Many Hard Forks Might ‚ÄòKill‚Äô Bitcoin\nShiller commented on the sheer number of Bitcoin hard forks saying :\nThere will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it‚Äôll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.\nThere are over 40 recorded Bitcoin hard forks with Bitcoin Cash the most popular of the lot. A recent report showed poor performance for many of the forks. Shiller predicts that there will be more Bitcoin hard forks in the future leading to a congestion of the Bitcoin identity. Even if Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs creation exists in the year 2118, Shiller expects that it will go by a different name saying:\nBitcoin won‚Äôt look anything like it is today. It will have a different name if it exists. The Bubble May Burst and Bitcoin Plummet to Zero\nShiller has in the past, referred to Bitcoin as a bubble . The BTC bubble argument is a popular notion for many mainstream finance experts who state that the market bears a resemblance to a typical bubble economy. According to Shiller, the Bitcoin hype lends itself more to group psychology than any actual economic metric. Thus, he predicts that BTC is doomed to be a failed currency experiment.\nSpeaking during the interview, Shiller identified a scenario where BTC could suffer a massive decline drawing parallels with the 2013 price plummet.\nThe one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000 and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was fading away. Not all Doom and Gloom for Bitcoin\nIn the past, Shiller has proven himself adept at identifying bubbles. He accurately called the dot-com and the housing bubbles years before they happened. Not even the Nobel Prize winner is confident of his Bitcoin doomsday prediction.\nI don‚Äôt mean to be dismissive [but] it [Bitcoin] looks like a bubble. It‚Äôs getting people enthusiastic, and there are making different kinds of cryptocurrencies. There are thousands of them now. Something good may come out of it.\nFour years after losing 80 percent of its value, BTC rose to $19,500 in mid-December 2017. The price has since dropped more than 50 percent even going below the $6,000 mark in February 2018. However, BTC is still up by 700 percent since the start of 2017.

In the early years, bitcoin was ruled by its hard-core proponents, known as bitcoin evangelists, and the lack of notoriety was evident in minimal trading volume and the price; a single bitcoin didn‚Äôt trade above $100 until 2013.\nHowever, the second phase has been less of an enigma. ‚ÄúThe subsequent ‚Äòboom‚Äô phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out,‚Äù wrote van der Burgt.\nThat fear, often referred to by the acronym FOMO, saw companies add coin- or blockchain-related terms to their names , hoping to capitalize on the booming interest in the industry. Furthermore, celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, launching or endorsing their own cryptocurrencies. However, as many of these companies have been exposed, these ‚Äònew‚Äô cryptocurrencies have blown by the way side‚Äîoften with legal ramifications.\nRead: Opinion: That Floyd Mayweather-backed cryptocurrency is another sign of a bursting bubble\nNow, even as price volatility subsides, the hype remains. Van der Burgt argues that the bitcoin bubble is now entering the euphoric stage, one with direct parallels with the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n‚ÄúThe euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,‚Äù said van der Burgt. ‚ÄúAccording to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.‚Äù\nRead: Dimon‚Äôs many bitcoin moments of regret, in one chart\nWhich brings us to now: the price of the worlds biggest digital currency has lost more than half its value since peaking in December 2017 and van der Burgt believes the market is entering the profit-taking stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops.\n‚ÄúThe subsequent ‚Äòpanic‚Äô phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin‚Äôs price would substantially crash,‚Äù wrote van der Burgt.\nHowever, like most bitcoin debates, the argument comes with a caveat.\n‚ÄúThen again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency,‚Äù van der Burgt said.\nFurther reading: These companies

Bitcoin Cash investors are claiming that the BCH network is the only network complying with the peer-to-peer electronic cash system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.\nJumping into the tug of war is MMA superstar Rory Macdonald, who stands on the Bitcoin cash side, saying: ‚Äú Bitcoin Cash [BCH] is the real Bitcoin .‚Äù\nSource Image: twitter.com\nAlthough he didn‚Äôt explicitly explain his arguments, he still claims that Bitcoin Cash is the original form of Bitcoin. Market participants, however, refuted his claim; they are considering the superstar‚Äôs favoritism as merely a promotional campaign from the management.\nSource Image: twitter.com\nTraders and investors on Twitter are criticizing MMA superstar Rory Macdonald on his claim. The majority of them believe that Rory Macdonald doesn‚Äôt have any knowledge about the cryptocurrency market. However, his comments have intensified the debate over which one of these two versions is the original and therefore, worth buying.\nPreviously Roger Ver and several other cryptocurrency experts supported Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin. They claim that the Bitcoin Cash network offers better transaction times and fees than Bitcoin, expecting BCH to replace BTC from the market-dominating position.\nSource Image: twitter.com\nRoger Ver is also an active supporter of Bitcoin Cash. The Bitcoin expert stated : ‚ÄúThe economic path that Bitcoin Cash is on is the one that led to Bitcoin‚Äôs original success ,‚Äù Ver said. ‚Äú I‚Äôm incredibly bullish on Bitcoin Cash for the same reasons I was bullish on Bitcoin back in 2011 .‚Äù\nBitcoin Cash price, on the other hand, has created substantial price movements amid speculations and recent network developments. Its price has hit the $1,800 level early in May. The BCH coin, however, retreated to the $1,000 level due to the broader market selloff.

We will see which medium we can use for trade.‚Äù\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India‚Äôs central bank, announced a crippling policy in April mandating RBI-regulated financial institutions prohibit their clients and users from purchasing cryptocurrencies. Banks were also barred from providing services to businesses ‚Äúdealing with or settling‚Äù cryptocurrencies.\nWhile it isn‚Äôt explicitly stated that the ban extends to transactions settled in cryptocurrency, there is no surprise in the Indian government opting not make a trade deal in the petro despite the substantial discount offered.\nVenezuela has the world‚Äôs largest oil reserves for any nation and announced its oil-backed cryptocurrency, the petro, in December in what would soon become the world‚Äôs first state cryptocurrency. Devised as a payment instrument to combat the economic sanctions and a US-led financial blockade, the cryptocurrency has seen plenty of criticism from within the country. In March, Venezuela‚Äôs National Assembly declared the ‚Äòunconstitutional‚Äô petro ‚Äò a fraud ‚Äô.\nNotably, India isn‚Äôt fussed about US sanctions facing Venezuela and Iran, the latter which has now become India‚Äôs top crude oil supplier .\n‚ÄúIndia follows only UN sanctions, and not unilateral sanctions by any country,‚Äù Swaraj added, insisting India would continue to trade with Venezuela despite oil imports from the South American nation being at their lowest levels in over five years.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

In the early years, bitcoin was ruled by its hard-core proponents, known as bitcoin evangelists, and the lack of notoriety was evident in minimal trading volume and the price; a single bitcoin didn't trade above $100 until 2013.\nHowever, the second phase has been less of an enigma. \"The subsequent 'boom' phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out,\" wrote van der Burgt.\nThat fear, often referred to by the acronym FOMO, saw companies add coin- or blockchain-related terms to their names (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/riot-blockchain-shares-down-11-despite-2-rise-for-bitcoin-2018-01-03), hoping to capitalize on the booming interest in the industry. Furthermore, celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, launching or endorsing their own cryptocurrencies. However, as many of these companies have been exposed, these 'new' cryptocurrencies have blown by the way side--often with legal ramifications.\nRead:Opinion: That Floyd Mayweather-backed cryptocurrency is another sign of a bursting bubble (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/that-floyd-mayweather-backed-cryptocurrency-barely-survives-its-first-round-2017-09-07)\nNow, even as price volatility subsides, the hype remains. Van der Burgt argues that the bitcoin bubble is now entering the euphoric stage, one with direct parallels with the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,\" said van der Burgt. \"According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.\"\nRead:Dimon's many bitcoin moments of regret, in one chart (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/all-the-times-dimon-may-regret-bashing-bitcoin-in-one-chart-2018-01-09)\nWhich brings us to now: the price of the worlds biggest digital currency has lost more than half its value since peaking in December 2017 and van der Burgt believes the market is entering the profit-taking stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops.\n\"The subsequent 'panic' phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin's price would substantially crash,\" wrote van der Burgt.\nHowever, like most bitcoin debates, the argument comes with a caveat.\n\"Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency,\" van der Burgt said.\nFurther reading: These companies jumped on the bitcoin train right before it derailed (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-companies-jumped-on-the-bitcoin-train-right-before-it-derailed-2018-03-16)\n-Aaron Hankin;\n 1336ET\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-companies-jumped-on-the-bitcoin-train-right-before-it-derailed-2018-03-16)", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-and-blockchains-broken-promises-2018-01-26)", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/that-floyd-mayweather-backed-cryptocurrency-barely-survives-its-first-round-2017-09-07)", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/all-the-times-dimon-may-regret-bashing-bitcoin-in-one-chart-2018-01-09)", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/riot-blockchain-shares-down-11-despite-2-rise-for-bitcoin-2018-01-03),", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aaron hankin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satosh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyman minsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roubini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:04:41.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f614ec21ac669ba475b24c8043e2a3ad10c0c41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c93faNQQmSCqAFJcNgl8UCyRqZivNqv19oW6sybeaPBqyV.WCjm4Fz.Za3QO3kuYdcxHGWHHvF9Y.ouMhN2vz323PypUNPxFtmDJVfmc18eE.BDhaVIj0dJ7fAbg_za6ZcrwTgK_smB5A--", "site_full": "www.cryptocoincache.com", "site": "cryptocoincache.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France ‚Äì Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts ‚Äì CryptoCoin Cache", "title_full": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France ‚Äì Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts ‚Äì CryptoCoin Cache", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.749, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f614ec21ac669ba475b24c8043e2a3ad10c0c41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c93faNQQmSCqAFJcNgl8UCyRqZivNqv19oW6sybeaPBqyV.WCjm4Fz.Za3QO3kuYdcxHGWHHvF9Y.ouMhN2vz323PypUNPxFtmDJVfmc18eE.BDhaVIj0dJ7fAbg_za6ZcrwTgK_smB5A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France ‚Äì Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts ‚Äì CryptoCoin Cache", "text": "Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Tucker has penned an article to accompany a little-reported research paper that was published last October. The economics writer met with one of the paper‚Äôs authors recently to discuss the threat posed to the Bitcoin network by quantum computing. Quantum Computing Poses Little Real Threat to Bitcoin\nAfter meeting with Gavin K. Brennen, a researcher at the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, Tucker has concluded that quantum computing was not nearly the fatalistic threat that many tout it to be to cryptocurrencies.\nQuantum computers have often been cited as an irrefutable kill switch for Bitcoin. The idea is that quantum machines, capable of processing data hundreds of times faster than the most advanced computers today, could either brute force signatures in little time or solve proof-of-work algorithms fast enough to pose a threat to the security of the Bitcoin network. This would render Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies entirely useless.\nAlthough Brennan et al. don‚Äôt entirely refute this notion in their lengthy paper titled ‚Äò Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them ,‚Äô they do conclude that the threat is not nearly as fatalistic as many perceive it. In fact, given that quantum computing is still being developed, the authors believe that there is plenty of time to protect networks against it.\nIn the companion article published by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) on Monday, Tucker praises the cryptocurrency community‚Äôs adeptness at problem solving:\n‚ÄúIf there is a known problem, there are people working on solutions, with tremendous professional awards accruing to the winner.‚Äù\nHe states that the adaptivity of a decentralised governance model excels at developing solutions to problems, particularly when the rewards for doing so are as great as they are with Bitcoin.\nIn the AIER article, Tucker summarises the position of the paper‚Äôs authors. When addressing the issue of quantum machines dominating proof-of-work, he references the original material:\n‚ÄúFuture improvements to quantum technology allowing gate speeds up to 100GHz could allow quantum computers to solve the PoW about 100 times faster than current technology. However, such a development is unlikely in the next decade, at which point classical hardware may be much faster, and quantum technology might be so widespread that no single quantum enabled agent could dominate the PoW problem.‚Äù\nHe then addresses the threat of quantum computer brute forcing signatures. He admits that this threat is ‚Äòmore real,‚Äô but is ‚Äònot without solutions.‚Äô These solutions are ‚Äòwithin reach of programmers today‚Äô and there is still the issue of the ten year head start developers have for creating more robust methods to protect against the perceived threat:\n‚ÄúMoreover, there are ten years of lead time to get there and adapt them to the protocol.‚Äù\nIn concluding his article, Brennan states that he believes the ‚Äòquantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring.‚Äô He states that the strong incentive to constantly increase the network‚Äôs security, along with the collective minds working on it makes any issues entirely fixable.\nThe closing paragraph of the article is so wonderfully put, you‚Äôll excuse me for including it verbatim:\n‚ÄúAs I listened to the paper, and his proposed solutions, it struck me how precise and intense is the brain trust behind this technology as compared with, for example, the Federal Reserve, the banking system, and existing fiat currency. The problems in the fiat status quo are enormous enough to fill whole libraries (starting with certain obvious problems: no one knows how much money the system produces, or how much crisis risk is present at any time, not even the people charged with managing the system). The problems revealed themselves in 2008. The system has not been repaired in a way that can prevent a repeat of that experience.‚Äù\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeffrey a. tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin k. brennen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "quantum computing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national university of singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for quantum technologies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T06:25:09.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5de5f00720004de0b04993132590388ec5c43108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUkEKSYP3F3N_wb.fCV2ftvRIIGRc0lyH9GsUSCGb0.fZ3ysPJhs4FkM_xqA.eAwsZPOZ_o7CRIvwfVkZjnqxCJrMlnoPASaZDUbuljiHGY1g--", "site_full": "networkurl.com", "site": "networkurl.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ripple CEO Says XRP is Better Than Bitcoin, Calls BTC Napster ‚Äì NetworkURL", "title_full": "Ripple CEO Says XRP is Better Than Bitcoin, Calls BTC Napster ‚Äì NetworkURL", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/networkurl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/0528_networkurl_default_960x720_003366.png?fit=960%2C720", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5de5f00720004de0b04993132590388ec5c43108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUkEKSYP3F3N_wb.fCV2ftvRIIGRc0lyH9GsUSCGb0.fZ3ysPJhs4FkM_xqA.eAwsZPOZ_o7CRIvwfVkZjnqxCJrMlnoPASaZDUbuljiHGY1g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple CEO Says XRP is Better Than Bitcoin, Calls BTC Napster ‚Äì NetworkURL", "text": "Thursday, May 31, 2018 Network Technology 0\nDuring a panel discussion at yesterdays Recode Code Conference in which blockchain, digital assets, and cryptocurrencies were on the program Ripple‚Äôs CEO called out Bitcoin as an idea that technology has passed by. Bitcoin is the Napster of Crypto As reported by Techcrunch a four-person panel at the Recode Code Conference including Brad Garinghouse gathered to discuss what the role of regulation around blockchain and cryptocurrency will be and when it will happen. Kathryn Haun, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and board member at Coinbase and HackerOne, took the position that there are parallels between where cryptocurrency is today and the internet in its early stages. Huan pointed out that in the early days of the internet there were calls for a single regulator which is happening with crypto now and that if regulations had been developed last year they would already be outdated due to the rise of initial coin offerings (ICO). ‚Äú We don‚Äôt want regulation to outpace understanding, ‚Äù she said. It was Ripple CEO Brad Garinghouse though who grabbed headlines when he described Bitcoin as an idea that has already been passed on by technology. He called Bitcoin transformative and gave it credit for launching the cryptocurrency revolution but that it will probably end up becoming the Napster of cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúWe may come to find that bitcoin is kind of the Napster of digital assets, this is transformative technology, but Spotify and iTunes and Pandora rule the day because they engaged with regulators to solve a real problem,‚Äù Garlinghouse said referring to regulatory problems that countries around the world are still struggling with when it comes to classifying what Bitcoin is. All Cryptocurrency is Bad Currency Garlinghouse went on to criticize the utility of Bitcoin as a currency. He pointed out that slow transaction times and high fees make Bitcoin impossible as a replacement for fiat currency. He told the audience, ‚ÄúPeople talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee, The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.‚Äù These aren‚Äôt new opinions for Garlinghouse who in the past has called all cryptocurrency ‚Äúbad currency‚Äù for their lack of utility, using a similar example at the time he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt call this cryptocurrency‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not currency. I can‚Äôt go to Starbucks or Amazon and use‚Äî‚Äù. Garlinghouse concluded by saying that digital currency only has value if they either solve a problem in the business world or improve their utility to solve consumer problems.\nFull details at www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/31/ripple-ceo-says-xrp-better-bitcoin-calls-btc-napster/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathryn haun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad ga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "better than bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calls btc napster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford graduate school of business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napster", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:48:50.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f136f69f31ec92de35384e9ea5856ec0697866d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_RxM_HmSNP8cBu1XD318jLtEe_eozKndKp0EYvsE0vH4C4N7tMCiq3m.45jqzc6F2.oy4HpWPQP7Je1oOQOwFRR9qcUOkYtvd7ixJI9KuEXEkhxfgptRgIfvckW_Z8jADonfwO3_NJmFRBUrASqiu8e3bSdqbq1HrhOC78KFcxThhHk.8rlnld", "site_full": "www.livebitcoinnews.com", "site": "livebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Hong Kong Monetary Authority Has No Plans to Issue Central Bank Digital Currency, Says Government Official - Bitcoin Network, News, Charts, Guides & Analysis", "title_full": "Hong Kong Monetary Authority Has No Plans to Issue Central Bank Digital Currency, Says Government Official - Bitcoin Network, News, Charts, Guides & Analysis", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/05/31162734/Digital-Currency-HKMA.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f136f69f31ec92de35384e9ea5856ec0697866d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_RxM_HmSNP8cBu1XD318jLtEe_eozKndKp0EYvsE0vH4C4N7tMCiq3m.45jqzc6F2.oy4HpWPQP7Je1oOQOwFRR9qcUOkYtvd7ixJI9KuEXEkhxfgptRgIfvckW_Z8jADonfwO3_NJmFRBUrASqiu8e3bSdqbq1HrhOC78KFcxThhHk.8rlnld", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rebecca Campbell", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hong Kong Monetary Authority Has No Plans to Issue Central Bank Digital Currency, Says Government Official - Bitcoin Network, News, Charts, Guides & Analysis", "text": "Sponsored by Binance .\nA government official for Hong Kong‚Äôs de facto central bank has said that there are no plans for it to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nJoseph Chan, Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), was speaking at a council meeting with legislators yesterday when the announcement was made. Chan was answering a question regarding the cryptocurrency market and the fact that it was reported that the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBoC) is to issue a statutory digital currency. This then raised the possibility of whether Hong Kong would issue its own.\nChan replied by saying :\n‚ÄúThe HKMA has carried out research on CBDC. At the same time, the HKMA notes that the benefits of CBDC and its efficiency gains will depend on the actual circumstances of a jurisdiction. In the context of Hong Kong, the already efficient payment infrastructure and services make CBDC a less attractive proposition. The HKMA has no plan to issue CBDC at this stage but will continue to monitor the international development.‚Äù\nChan went on to say that the nature of holding and transacting with digital currencies can lead to potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks. However, while the HKMA will continue to promote financial innovation, the acting secretary stated that the central bank will maintain its position ‚Äòto protect the interest of the investing public.‚Äô\nHe also brought up the topic of initial coin offerings (ICOs). At a G20 meeting held at the end of March discussions took place over the risks and related issues with cryptocurrencies. Chan added that the meeting ended with an agreement that there was a need to closely monitor the market.\n‚ÄúWe will continue to monitor the development of ICOs and ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù in Hong Kong, and maintain close contacts with regulators in other jurisdictions through active participation in meetings of relevant international organisations, such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the Financial Stability Board,‚Äù he added.

Waited Out Hard Forks\nGerman law enforcement arrested members of a criminal group and raided their residences around June 2017. Almost immediately after their arrest, the criminals agreed to forfeit their private keys and access to their cryptocurrency wallets, surrendering 1,312 Bitcoin and 220 Ether.\nThe German government commenced a sale of the stolen cryptocurrencies in November and sold the criminal group‚Äôs holdings throughout November and December. Because 1,312 Bitcoins were confiscated before July and October, the government was able to benefit from the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in July and the Bitcoin Gold hard fork in October, obtaining 1,312 Bitcoin Gold and 1,312 Bitcoin Cash in the process.\nIn June, 1,312 Bitcoin and 220 Ether were worth $3.6 million, as Bitcoin and Ether were valued at $2,700 and $220 respectively. By November, due to the appreciation in the value of both Bitcoin and Ether, and the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold hard forks, the total value of the digital assets seized was $14 million. Within six months, the cryptocurrency holdings of the criminal group confiscated by the German government had quadrupled in value.\nThe timing of the sale of the confiscated digital assets by the German authorities was advantageous as well, given that starting January 2018, the valuation of the cryptocurrency markets and major digital currencies such as Bitcoin began to fall sharply, and over the past five months, the cryptocurrency market lost nearly 70 percent of its value.\nBenjamin Krause, a German prosecutor, noted that the authorities had been fortunate enough to convince the criminal group to forfeit their private keys and provide the government with access to their wallets, as without those keys, even if the local authorities had obtained the wallets of the criminals, they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten access to their funds. History of Seizure\nOne member of the Bitcoin community claimed that the German government had arrested and raided the residences of Bitcoin traders and cryptocurrency investors in the past. In one instance, a Bitcoin investor claimed that he‚Äôd been arrested after sending funds to Poland to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\n‚ÄúMy computer had 6 different 50+ character passwords to get through before they could get to my private keys. Must have pissed those Stasi off. They probably figured they held the mother load of all Dark Web crime on that computer. The reality is that I had copies of my keys elsewhere. As soon as they stole my funds I moved my Bitcoins somewhere else,‚Äù the investor said, adding that investing in Bitcoin using Polish banks and exchanges was and is still legal.\n‚ÄúThey took the longest they could legally take to return it all (of course, because I wasn‚Äôt doing anything illegal ‚Äì buying Bitcoin is legal in Germany even if you‚Äôre buying from a Polish exchange). Of course, I wiped all [my] computers and sold them immediately.‚Äù About The Author\nJoseph Young is a finance and tech journalist based in Hong Kong.

In the early years, bitcoin was ruled by its hard-core proponents, known as bitcoin evangelists, and the lack of notoriety was evident in minimal trading volume and the price; a single bitcoin didn‚Äôt trade above $100 until 2013.\nHowever, the second phase has been less of an enigma. ‚ÄúThe subsequent ‚Äòboom‚Äô phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out,‚Äù wrote van der Burgt.\nThat fear, often referred to by the acronym FOMO, saw companies add coin- or blockchain-related terms to their names , hoping to capitalize on the booming interest in the industry. Furthermore, celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, launching or endorsing their own cryptocurrencies. However, as many of these companies have been exposed, these ‚Äònew‚Äô cryptocurrencies have blown by the way side‚Äîoften with legal ramifications.\nRead: Opinion: That Floyd Mayweather-backed cryptocurrency is another sign of a bursting bubble\nNow, even as price volatility subsides, the hype remains. Van der Burgt argues that the bitcoin bubble is now entering the euphoric stage, one with direct parallels with the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n‚ÄúThe euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,‚Äù said van der Burgt. ‚ÄúAccording to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.‚Äù\nRead: Dimon‚Äôs many bitcoin moments of regret, in one chart\nWhich brings us to now: the price of the worlds biggest digital currency has lost more than half its value since peaking in December 2017 and van der Burgt believes the market is entering the profit-taking stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops.\n‚ÄúThe subsequent ‚Äòpanic‚Äô phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin‚Äôs price would substantially crash,‚Äù wrote van der Burgt.\nHowever, like most bitcoin debates, the argument comes with a caveat.\n‚ÄúThen again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency,‚Äù van der Burgt said.\nFurther reading: These companies jumped on the bitcoin train right before it derailed\nAaron Hankin Aaron Hankin is a MarketWatch reporter in New York who covers cryptocurrency and financial markets.\nWe Want to Hear from You Join the conversation\nComment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "http://twitter.com/@ahhankin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyman minsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roubini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:36:23.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44bb4312d4b74b4eeedae78c3c28ddcd5152a5e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxQjnJ2XIps7Dt4UeznJ0zo-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44bb4312d4b74b4eeedae78c3c28ddcd5152a5e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxQjnJ2XIps7Dt4UeznJ0zo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "text": "‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó\n‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë\n‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë\n‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ïö‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë\n‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ïö‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïó‚ïö‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïî‚ïù‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë ‚ïö‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ïë\n‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù‚ïö‚ïê‚ïù ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

Tucker has penned an article to accompany a little-reported research paper that was published last October. The economics writer met with one of the paper‚Äôs authors recently to discuss the threat posed to the Bitcoin network by quantum computing. Quantum Computing Poses Little Real Threat to Bitcoin\nAfter meeting with Gavin K. Brennen, a researcher at the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, Tucker has concluded that quantum computing was not nearly the fatalistic threat that many tout it to be to cryptocurrencies.\nQuantum computers have often been cited as an irrefutable kill switch for Bitcoin. The idea is that quantum machines, capable of processing data hundreds of times faster than the most advanced computers today, could either brute force signatures in little time or solve proof-of-work algorithms fast enough to pose a threat to the security of the Bitcoin network. This would render Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies entirely useless.\nAlthough Brennan et al. don‚Äôt entirely refute this notion in their lengthy paper titled ‚Äò Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them ,‚Äô they do conclude that the threat is not nearly as fatalistic as many perceive it. In fact, given that quantum computing is still being developed, the authors believe that there is plenty of time to protect networks against it.\nIn the companion article published by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) on Monday, Tucker praises the cryptocurrency community‚Äôs adeptness at problem solving:\n‚ÄúIf there is a known problem, there are people working on solutions, with tremendous professional awards accruing to the winner.‚Äù\nHe states that the adaptivity of a decentralised governance model excels at developing solutions to problems, particularly when the rewards for doing so are as great as they are with Bitcoin.\nIn the AIER article, Tucker summarises the position of the paper‚Äôs authors. When addressing the issue of quantum machines dominating proof-of-work, he references the original material:\n‚ÄúFuture improvements to quantum technology allowing gate speeds up to 100GHz could allow quantum computers to solve the PoW about 100 times faster than current technology. However, such a development is unlikely in the next decade, at which point classical hardware may be much faster, and quantum technology might be so widespread that no single quantum enabled agent could dominate the PoW problem.‚Äù\nHe then addresses the threat of quantum computer brute forcing signatures. He admits that this threat is ‚Äòmore real,‚Äô but is ‚Äònot without solutions.‚Äô These solutions are ‚Äòwithin reach of programmers today‚Äô and there is still the issue of the ten year head start developers have for creating more robust methods to protect against the perceived threat:\n‚ÄúMoreover, there are ten years of lead time to get there and adapt them to the protocol.‚Äù\nIn concluding his article, Brennan states that he believes the ‚Äòquantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring.‚Äô He states that the strong incentive to constantly increase the network‚Äôs security, along with the collective minds working on it makes any issues entirely fixable.\nThe closing paragraph of the article is so wonderfully put, you‚Äôll excuse me for including it verbatim:\n‚ÄúAs I listened to the paper, and his proposed solutions, it struck me how precise and intense is the brain trust behind this technology as compared with, for example, the Federal Reserve, the banking system, and existing fiat currency. The problems in the fiat status quo are enormous enough to fill whole libraries (starting with certain obvious problems: no one knows how much money the system produces, or how much crisis risk is present at any time, not even the people charged with managing the system). The problems revealed themselves in 2008. The system has not been repaired in a way that can prevent a repeat of that experience.‚Äù\nResearch Paper Refutes Threat to Bitcoin Posed by Quantum Computing was last modified: May 31st, 2018 by Rick D.

Bitcoin is the Napster of Crypto\nAs reported by Techcrunch a four-person panel at the Recode Code Conference including Brad Garinghouse gathered to discuss what the role of regulation around blockchain and cryptocurrency will be and when it will happen. Kathryn Haun, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and board member at Coinbase and HackerOne, took the position that there are parallels between where cryptocurrency is today and the internet in its early stages.\nHuan pointed out that in the early days of the internet there were calls for a single regulator which is happening with crypto now and that if regulations had been developed last year they would already be outdated due to the rise of initial coin offerings (ICO). ‚Äú We don‚Äôt want regulation to outpace understanding, ‚Äù she said.\nIt was Ripple CEO Brad Garinghouse though who grabbed headlines when he described Bitcoin as an idea that has already been passed on by technology. He called Bitcoin transformative and gave it credit for launching the cryptocurrency revolution but that it will probably end up becoming the Napster of cryptocurrency.\n‚ÄúWe may come to find that bitcoin is kind of the Napster of digital assets, this is transformative technology, but Spotify and iTunes and Pandora rule the day because they engaged with regulators to solve a real problem,‚Äù Garlinghouse said referring to regulatory problems that countries around the world are still struggling with when it comes to classifying what Bitcoin is. All Cryptocurrency is Bad Currency\nGarlinghouse went on to criticize the utility of Bitcoin as a currency. He pointed out that slow transaction times and high fees make Bitcoin impossible as a replacement for fiat currency. He told the audience,\n‚ÄúPeople talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee, The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.‚Äù\nThese aren‚Äôt new opinions for Garlinghouse who in the past has called all cryptocurrency ‚Äúbad currency‚Äù for their lack of utility, using a similar example at the time he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt call this cryptocurrency‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not currency. I can‚Äôt go to Starbucks or Amazon and use‚Äî‚Äù.
