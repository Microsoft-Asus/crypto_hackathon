However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check.

McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip\nJohn McAfee’s prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday .

McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly.

Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nOn Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives.

And the online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it started accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. Man Goes All In on Crypto\nThe most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest it all in crypto. The Canadian man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there.

Coinbase is also opening a New York office to focus on Wall Street clients.\nThe six-year-old company runs the largest U.S. digital-currency exchange by volume and offers a popular app for storing and transferring bitcoin. Coinbase doesn’t directly bet on the price of bitcoin, but instead makes money by collecting fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency.\nCoinbase enjoyed eye-popping growth in late 2017 as small investors piled into bitcoin. It now boasts of more than 20 million customers—more than Charles Schwab Corp. , which has 10.8 million active brokerage accounts.\n“In U.S. markets, Coinbase is just way ahead of everyone,” said Ari Lewis, co-founder of crypto hedge fund Grasshopper Capital. “And they’re not standing still with the retail stuff.”\nBut the end of bitcoin mania raises questions about whether Coinbase’s success has peaked. Its exchange handled about $8 billion worth of digital-currency trades in April, down 78% from its record volume in December, according to CryptoCompare.\nRegulators could also trip up Coinbase’s quest to broaden bitcoin’s appeal. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned in March that many crypto trading platforms were potentially unlawful . Coinbase has approached the SEC and U.S. bank regulators about obtaining various federal licenses, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nCoinbase was founded in 2012 by Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb Inc. software engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. foreign-exchange trader. Mr. Ehrsam left in 2017 but remains on the firm’s board.\nWhen Coinbase launched, bitcoin was little known outside a small circle of enthusiasts, many of them libertarians inspired by the idea of a currency outside government control.\nCoinbase always aimed to take bitcoin mainstream, say current and former employees. A major goal was to make it easy to exchange so-called “fiat” currencies—dollars, euros and so on—for bitcoin. That wasn’t always straightforward: Early on, one popular way was for bitcoin aficionados to arrange meetings at Starbucks and swap the digital currency for cash.\nAt a time when bitcoin was widely associated with crime, Coinbase cooperated with U.S. authorities. It registered as a money-services business with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2013 and has since amassed 41 state licenses.\n“The early days of crypto were very much like the Wild West, with very little legal clarity,” says Charlie Shrem, right, who founded BitInstant, an early rival of Coinbase. He pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business and spent about a year and a half in prison. Photo: Louis Lanzano/Associated Press That helped Coinbase avoid the fate of rivals such as BitInstant, whose founder, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014 in a case linked to the Silk Road underground narcotics bazaar. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business and spent about a year and a half in prison. “The early days of crypto were very much like the Wild West, with very little legal clarity,” Mr. Shrem said in an email.\nOther bitcoin exchanges failed after hackers stole investors’ funds. But Coinbase says it has never been hacked. “Not being compromised is one of the big reasons that Coinbase is what it is today,” said Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early employee who now leads crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital.\nCoinbase has had its share of growing pains. The company says its user base doubled from August to December. That led to overloaded systems and customers unable to reach tech support.\nAbout 1,530 complaints have been filed about Coinbase with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so far this year, more than American Express Co. and PayPal Holdings Inc. combined, according to CFPB data.\nCoinbase customer Nikhil Thomas says he was unable to access his account for four months because of a problem verifying his identity. “The ordeal was painful,” he said. The company declined to comment on his experience but said it has expanded its customer-support team by more than 150% over the past three months. Photo: Andrew Mangum for The Wall Street Journal Nikhil Thomas, an IT analyst in Maryland, was unable to access his Coinbase account for four months because of a problem verifying his identity. Calls and emails to customer service yielded few results, and he missed out on thousands of dollars in profits as bitcoin tumbled, he said. “The ordeal was painful,” Mr. Thomas said in an interview.\nCoinbase declined to comment on Mr. Thomas’s experience, but says it was overwhelmed as its user base mushroomed. \"As a result of this unprecedented demand, some customers had a poor experience,” Dan Romero, general manager of Coinbase’s retail business, said in an email.\nOver the past three months, Coinbase has expanded its customer-support team by more than 150% and resolved 95% of its outstanding requests for help, Mr. Romero added.\nCoinbase has faced other controversies. In December, it vowed to probe allegations of insider trading after suspicious market moves accompanied the introduction of Bitcoin Cash, a bitcoin offshoot, on Coinbase’s exchange. The price of Bitcoin Cash climbed 28% in the 24 hours before Coinbase announced the launch, fueling rumors that some traders had been tipped off in advance.\nA spokeswoman declined to discuss the insider-trading allegations, citing pending lawsuits. Coinbase has previously said it prohibits employees from trading on nonpublic information or sharing it with people outside the company.\nThe end of bitcoin mania raises questions about whether Coinbase’s success has peaked. Its exchange handled about $8 billion worth of digital-currency trades in April, down 78% from its record volume in December, according to CryptoCompare. Photo: Brian Flaherty for The Wall Street Journal There is no guarantee that Coinbase will maintain its lead over rivals. Robinhood, the free stock-trading app with more than four million users, added cryptocurrency trading in February. That could erode Coinbase’s hold over retail crypto investors.\nMr. Thomas is considering Robinhood after his frustrating experience. “Coinbase works beautifully,” he said, “until you have a problem.”\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:40:10.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15730ef1b08cac6ea8a981e7970c990d74ded569", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRMLQxqGP8Jjwd750EVworgnD0RgCSoO9IiyufaoCuzw5CfC52WyVk1naOsVWzkyJC7p6PFqo_mqeHwT1EhHdpBUWk.DFRpvBF5N2nvWrfjyQ--", "site_full": "thedayaftergr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thedayaftergr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Thedayaftergr", "title": "CNBC: Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses says blockchain venture capitalist.

I bought into the same mentality for a long time, but I'm changing my tune. In almost every industry, first generation leaders are replaced by competition. From Sears, Kmart, Nokia, Motorola, Yahoo, MySpace, etc. Although Bitcoin is the current crypto reserve currency, I think that its dominance is threatened by ALT coins with faster, cheaper transactions and greater scalability. What do you think? Is it smart to hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment, or are there better choices among the ALT coins like Ethereum or Litecoin?\nI know that scenario could happen but for now, bitcoin is still the number one choice. We've seen bitcoin cash trying so hard to dethrone btc but it failed miserably.

I have been a verified user on their site for many years.\nA year ago or so, they introduced the KYC procedure to me (I don't know when it was introduced for other users). Recently I filled it in, thinking that would be the end of it.\nIt was far from the end of it. In the KYC questionnaire I stated that all my Bitcoins come from mining (which they do). I tried to answer all questions truthfully. Now, all of a sudden, Bitstamp is making all sorts of speculative allegations around some Bitcoin coming from mining, some from gambling and various other unknown transactions. Some even to Helix, the former tor-based Bitcoin mixer service, allegedly. I find that very intriguing, as I am reasonably sure I didn't ever use it. Particularly not from my passport-verified Bitstamp account. But even if someone did, I wonder why Helix is being singled out? It feels a bit as though they are going after oddly specific addresses or transactions.\nAs for the 'gambling' it is of course possible that at some point in the past I've moved some Bitcoin from my local wallet to a gambling site and then from there into Bitstamp. But that doesn't change these BTC originally came from mining, making my response truthful regardless. The KYC questionnaire does not include \"please provide the exact route all your Bitcoin took in getting here\".\nIt is particularly worrying to think that they feel they will just provide me with a few transaction IDs, and that they expect I would somehow know what these random strings of letters and numbers mean, when in the background they have already built a speculative view of what they are.\nThis makes me think that they cannot rely on their methods and are hoping to fish for confirmations from the users about their transactions.\nAt no point was I informed that I need to keep my entire transaction history (which I happily would have done, had I known), that they are building a profile of your transactions behind the scenes, without your knowledge (after all, my transaction history is all just IDs, no other information visible. They should really make this stuff transparent to users.) and that they would use this to ask very personal questions about my transaction history.\nWhat if I bought a bunch of sex-toys through Helix, hoping to stay anonymous, and now Bitstamp show up analysing my history going \"oh, look, they sent £5 to this sex shop via Helix, naughty\". Where are they getting this data from?\nTheir support simply said it was a \"Blockchain Analysis\".\nLastly, the amounts we are talking about, that I have ever owned or traded are pitiful. That makes this particularly worrying. Why would someone care about such a tiny amount of Bitcoin? Surely if this is all about avoiding money laundering and illegal activities, you would look for places where actually large amount of Bitcoin are being shifted.\nI would warn you all to proceed with caution. I have requested all my information be released under GDPR, but I have a feeling they will find a way to worm their way out of that.\nHas this happened to anyone else?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kyc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitstamp", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:28:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "731ca3baaabd5fd93b02306cbd64915c15d922eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArxJ.dUgQuLJU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown -

An intraday low $998.8 held above the day’s first major support level at $967.9 in the early hours, with a mid-morning rally seeing Bitcoin Cash back through to $1,000 levels with an intraday high $1,049.9 before a late in the day pullback. The moves through Saturday failed to test the day’s first major resistance level at $1,062, with the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,155.6 some way off, leaving the bearish trend intact as investors fret of government oversight. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 2.28% to $982.4, with the late Saturday sell-off continuing into the early hours of this morning, Bitcoin Cash falling through the day’s first major support level at $985.5 to call on support at the day’s second major support level at $966.6 with an early $969.5 low before recovering to current levels. For the day ahead, a move back through $1,000 to $1,020 would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $1,036.6 and the second major resistance level at $1,068.8, before any reversal, with the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,155.6 likely to be left untested for another day. Failure to move through to $1,020 could see Bitcoin Cash’s troubles worsen to round off a dire week, with the day’s third major support level at $915.5 likely to come into play should the negative sentiment across the cryptomarket persist through the morning. There’s a long way to go for Bitcoin Cash to reverse the current bearish trend and the news wires have yet to deliver any good news to shift investor sentiment, which will continue to cap gains over the near-term.

Following the broader market, Litecoin slipped to an early $118 low, holding above the day’s first major support level at $116.08, before a late morning rally saw Litecoin hit an intraday high $122.63, a late in the day reversal then pinning Litecoin back at sub-$120 levels. A range bound afternoon led investors to lock in profits, with Litecoin failing to test the day’s first major resistance level at $123.24 to have a run at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $130.98, supporting the extended bearish trend formed in early May. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 0.59% to $117.63, a start of the day slide to an intraday low $116.51 calling on support at the day’s first major support level at $116.34 to move through to a morning high $118.38, before easing back to $117 levels, the day’s first major resistance level at $121.47 untested early. For the day ahead, while the late sell-off on Saturday weighed on Litecoin in the early hours, sentiment could shift through the morning, sub-$120 levels considered to be attractive for even the less bullish Litecoin investor. A move through $119.5 to $120 levels would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $121.47 to bring $125 levels into play, while the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $130.98 will likely be a step too far, key resistance levels likely to pin back the chances of an extended end of weekend rally. Story Continues Failure to move through to test $121 resistance could see Litecoin see a heavier loss later in the day, with the day’s second major support level at $114.36 in play, the bearish trend expected to continue for now as the investors continue to face uncertainty over cryptomarket regulations. LTC/USD 27/05/18 4-Hourly Chart Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly Ripple Bucks the Trend Ripple’s XRP managed to avoid further losses on Saturday, gaining 0.01% to end the day at $0.6052, leaving Ripple’s XRP down 13.4% for the current week. A slide through to an intraday low $0.59563 in the early hours saw Ripple’s XRP hold above the day’s first major support level at $0.5869 before a mid-morning rally kicked in. Ripple’s XRP moved through to a morning high $0.6273, coming within reach of the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6298 before easing back to a range bound afternoon. An intraday high $0.62801 also fell short of the day’s first major resistance level late in the day, leading to a late reversal back through to $0.60 levels, the failure to break through key resistance levels to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6612 continuing to support the extended bearish trend formed in late April. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down 0.83% to $0.60051, with the late Saturday sell-off leading Ripple’s XRP to a start of the day low $0.59348 before recovering to $0.60 levels, the early low testing support at the day’s first major support level at $0.5912. Negative sentiment through the start of the day left Ripple’s XRP well short of the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6236 with a morning $0.60846 high, a choppy day ahead on the cards. For the day ahead, a move through $0.6090 would support a break into $0.61 levels and a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6236 to raise the prospects of a bearish trend reversal, though with investors quick to lock in profits, Ripple’s XRP is unlikely to test the day’s second major resistance level at $0.642. Failure to break through to $0.61 levels could see Ripple’s XRP take a hit later in the day, with the day’s first major support level at $0.5912 and second major support level at $0.5772 likely to be in play before support kicks in. The bearish trend remains intact and, while Ripple’s blockchain platform is one of the more successful, until there is some clarity on planned regulations across the cryptomarket, the pain will likely continue.

Blockchains act as decentralized systems for recording and documenting transactions that take place involving a particular digital currency. Put simply, blockchain is a transaction ledger that maintains identical copies across each member computer within a network.\nAny party is able to both review previous entries and record new ones, although most blockchain networks have complex rules for the addition of new groups of records, \"blocks,\" to the chain of previous records. The blocks and the contents within them are protected by powerful cryptography, which insures that previous transactions within the network cannot be either forged or destroyed. In this way, blockchain technology allows a digital currency to maintain a trusted transaction network without relying on a central authority . It is for this reason that digital currencies are thought of as \"decentralized.\" (See also: How Does Blockchain Work? )\nWhile blockchain is most famous for its role in facilitating the rise of digital currencies over the past several years, there are also many other non-cryptocurrency uses for this technology. Indeed, some blockchain proponents believe that the technology could far outpace cryptocurrencies themselves in terms of its overall impact, and that the real potential of blockchain is only just now being discovered. As such, it's likely that financial advisors and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it's being utilized in any number of other applications. Below, we'll explore some of the most exciting and popular use cases likely to bring blockchain further into the world of mainstream business and finance. Cross-Border Payments\nTraditionally, the transfer of value has been both expensive and slow, according to a report by Deloitte , and especially for payments taking place across international borders. One reason for this is that, when multiple currencies are involved, the transfer process typically requires multiple banks in multiple locations before the intended recipient can actually collect his or her money. There are existing services to help facilitate this process in a faster way, but these tend to by quite expensive.\nBlockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster and cheaper alternative to traditional cross-border payments methods. Indeed, while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount, blockchain may allow for costs as low as 2%, as well as guaranteed and real-time transaction processing speeds. There are hurdles to be passed, including regulation of cryptocurrencies in different parts of the world and security concerns. Nonetheless, this is one of the most promising and talked about areas of blockchain technology application. (For more, see: Bitcoin's Most Profitable Use: the $600 Billion Overseas Remittance Business? ) Smart Contracts\nSmart contracts are often seen as a highly powerful application of blockchain technology. These contracts are actually computer programs that can oversee all aspects of an agreement, from facilitation to execution. When conditions are met, smart contracts can be entirely self-executing and self-enforcing. For proponents of smart contracts, these tools provide a more secure, more automated alternative to traditional contract law, as well as an application that is faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\nThe potential applications of smart contract technology are essentially limitless and could extend to almost any field of business in which contract law would normally apply. Of course, while highly touted, smart contracts are not a magical substitute for old-fashioned diligence. In fact, the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a cautionary tale and a warning to investors to not assume that smart contracts are any better than the information and organization that a user puts into them. Nonetheless, smart contracts remain one of the most exciting ways that blockchain technology has already extended beyond the cryptocurrency space and into the broader business world. (See also: Understanding Smart Contracts .) Identity Management\nOne of the most problematic results of the internet age has been identity security. As diligent as many individuals and organizations are in maintaining their online identities and securing private information, there are always nefarious actors looking to steal and profit off of these digital items. Blockchain technology has already demonstrated the potential for transforming the way that online identity management takes place.\nBlockchain offers a tremendous level of security, thanks to independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network. In digital currency cases, this verification is used to approve transactions before they are added to the chain. This mechanism could just as easily be applied to other types of verification procedures, including identity verification and many other applications as well.\nAt this point, blockchain is a technology with an exceptionally broad set of potential uses. Although blockchain is most famous for its connections to the blossoming cryptocurrency world, several other applications have already been explored. Perhaps even more exciting, though, is that new ways of utilizing blockchain emerge every day. As such, whether you are directly involved in the digital currency space or not, it's essential to develop an understanding of blockchain and how it may be used to transform the business and investment worlds.

He intoned few words about Bitcoin [BTC] in his speech and got the crowd’s attention through his rhythm.\nThe Bitcoin [BTC] enthusiast and entrepreneur, earlier predicted that Bitcoin will reach a value of $250,000 in 2022. He mentioned this prediction in his book and stands by it.\nEarlier, on 23rd May, he presented his vision for digital governments based on blockchain technology in an opening keynote speech at the GovTech Pioneers Conference.\nHe explained this vision for the future, in terms of Healthcare:\n“Insurance, healthcare, and the real estate industry are offering a terribly poor service and need a lot of money. Governments that burn a lot of money for the worst service feel that first.”\nHe stuck to his prediction that Bitcoin will soar to $250,000 by 2022. In the Next Web conference, he spoke about the potential in technology regarding the banks and venture capital. He spoke about his hopes about cryptocurrency, the new world order, and his bullish beliefs about the token, Bitcoin [BTC].\nHe also believes that fiat currency will lose its value, he said:\n“So, you’ll go in and try to buy coffee with fiat and the barista will laugh at you..

Many crypto enthusiasts speculate that it might be a week full of struggle for Bitcoin that has touched below $7,500 USD mark in the past few days. More If the crypto market sentiments weren’t depressing enough, regulatory news and chatter from all around the world are indicating tough times ahead for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is taking continuous blows and recovery seems pretty tough. But what caused this situation and how much damage has been done? Let’s find out in the remainder of this article.\nThe Idea behind Bitcoin The world’s first and largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is famous for being the decentralized peer-to-peer network. The idea of not depending on any governing authorities’ networks and not being controlled by any person is why Bitcoin is believed to be perfectly designed for hassle-free payments and money transaction between two people. Bitcoin’s anonymity has attracted the attention of many entrepreneurs and crypto enthusiasts who developed altcoins based on bitcoin’s technology aiming to perfect its functionality. Bitcoin has now spread across the globe and is being used for payments as well as trading another crypto.\nRecent Failed Bull Breakout The failed bullish breakout has Bitcoin prices in deep waters. The decline started on Sunday when bitcoin failingly attempted a comeback. Bulls could only raise the price point to $8,644 USD and since then the market has been tumbling down to approximately $8,240 USD which has currently gone down to $7,300 USD. There are several reasons for which bitcoin markets and cryptocurrency market as a whole is experiencing such extreme bearish trends. Analysts have pointed out that it may have to do with the Chinese ICO markets being highly active and resulting in strict regulatory actions. The Chinese government has officially announced that it deems shady ICOs as great risks and that the government watchdog is keeping a close eye on excessive speculation, fraudulent profit schemes, and fake propaganda.\nReasons Affecting Bitcoin Global Prices The major reasons that might’ve caused the current bitcoin market condition are; initial Mt Gox sell-off which made bitcoin lose $9,000 USD footing, the recent scandals which shot down Upbit, biggest cryptocurrency exchanges of South Korea and also the recent Bitfinex taxation policy which is under extreme criticism by crypto investors worldwide. Bitcoin markets experienced high losses when the news broke out regarding initial Mt Gox sell-off. The executives who are in charge of refunding users of Mt Gox before its hack apparently sold around 8000 BTC which amounts to be approximately, $70 million USD.\nAround the same time, Upbit which is known as one of the most influential crypto exchange located in South Korea was suddenly investigated by Financial Supervisory Commission. FUD spread like wildfire and millions of traders assumed that Upbit which is a subsidiary of communications Influencer Giant ‘Kakao’ might’ve been compromised. After some time, an official announcement came out from Upbit confirming that there haven’t been any raids of any sort and that the motive of FSC, as well as the Korean police force, was an investigation and that the exchange platform remains functional.\nThe most recent negative sentiments around bitcoin price arise from Bitfinex newly implemented taxation policy. On 17 th May, Bitfinex requested some of their users to forfeit their Tax IDs and also their social security number which the government of the British Virgin Island (Bitfinex headquarter) may exchange with tax authorities of the country to which the user belongs. This idea was immediately boo-ed by crypto enthusiasts and influential trading groups such as Whalepool which publicly announced that they’ll stop using Bitfinex unless the taxation policy remains.\nBitcoin Market Position Even at the current crypto market’s slump, there’s no denying that Bitcoin still holds the place of the biggest cryptocurrency of the world. The individual price has dropped to approximately $7,340 USD. the current position is still miles away from recovery point and analysts say that unless BTC crosses the barrier of $8,500 USD, there won’t be any bullish breakouts. It is still uncertain whether bitcoin prices will manage to recover from the current market trends and reaches the resistance level.\nSuggested Articles\nBitcoin’s Lightning Network: How Can it Solve Bitcoin’s Biggest Problem How Bitcoin Can Destroy the World. Completely! The Next Cryptocurrency Evolution: Countries Issue their Own Cryptocurrency Should You Still HODL? Undoubtedly, Bitcoin markets are presently under red zone and there’s no guarantee as to when and how it’ll climb back up towards recovery so that Bitcoin holders may get over the damage. But many traders look at this opportunity to get in the game and hold their Bitcoin in hope for collecting profits in the long run. Like the thumb’s rule of crypto trading goes, ‘buy the dip’ it isn’t that of a bad idea to buy Bitcoin. But one of the many reasons newcomers in the crypto markets are hesitant of buying crypto during a slump is because there’s no telling when the dip will be over. All we can ascertain with trading charts and sentiment analysis is that the market will be rushing towards recovery very soon.\nThis article was written by Global Coin Report .\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: USD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis – Critical Area on Daily Chart is 108.641 – 108.604 ICO vs. DAICO: What’s the Difference?

The current number on coinmarketcap has also drastically declined.\nOn May 23, Bitcoin value fell below $8000 mark, reaching its multiweek minimum of $7442, according to Kraken crypto exchange. As for altcoins, Ethereum price has dropped to $586, losing more than 10%, while Litecoin is down 8.2% at the level of $119. The most significant loss has been suffered by Bitcoin Cash, which is now trading below $1000, 15.8% fall. What Is the Point of the US Investigation?\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has decided to explore carefully the matter of cryptocurrency manipulation. There is a suspicion that the crypto market traders are playing around with the price of Bitcoin and other crypto coins.\nIn fact, the financial market regulator aims at investigating illegal activity that can be a reason for crypto price changing, for example, spoofing or expanding fake information in order to make other traders buy or sell trade coins, Bloomberg reports. However, there is no evidence proving that price drops are connected to the investigation held by the DOJ. Experts’ Predictions\nTom Lee, an analyst for Fundstart Global Advisors, who is known for his \"bullish\" attitude towards cryptocurrency, said in an interview with CNBC that his target for Bitcoin price remains at the level of $25,000. He explains the reason for a fall on the market can be the fact that investors have chosen to wait for a later clarification of the regulatory environment.\nOther traders are less optimistic. Thus, Jani Ziedins, an analyst from Cracked.Market believes that the Bitcoin rate will go down, overcoming support levels. “Last week’s $9k support has turned into this week’s $8k support.

There is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to decline further and it could even break the last swing low of $948 in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is in a bearish trend below $1,080 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD remains at a risk of more declines towards the $920 and $850 levels. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline This past week, there were sharp declines from the $1,100 swing high in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined and broke a few important support levels such as $1,050 and $1,000. It traded towards the $950 level before starting an upside correction. A low was formed at $948 and the price corrected above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low. However, the upside move was capped by the $1,050 resistance. It also failed to test and break the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low. BCH price is declining once again and it seems like it could retest the $948 low in the short term. A break below $948 could open the doors for a test of the $920 and $900 support levels. To the topside, there is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart, the price is facing a tough challenge on the upside near $1,060 and the trend line. Above this, the last swing high of $1.150 is the next major hurdle for buyers. Looking at the technical indicators: 4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly negative in the bearish zone. 4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is declining towards the 30 level.

Try https://ift.tt/2A5g4Xf\nThere’s a new card game called ‘Bitcon’ that’s been introduced on Kickstarter that allows people to experience the cryptocurrency investment fever for amusement and laughs. The strategy game was created by two cryptocurrency investors who were tired of hearing about people doing unbelievable things like selling their home or using their student loan money to go ‘all in’ on a portfolio of digital assets.\nAlso read: Project to Build Satoshi Statue Gains Support in Kiev\nWin Big or Lose it All Playin ‘Bitcon’ Two guys named Brandon and Sam who call themselves the ‘two stupid investors,’ created a tabletop card game that replicates cryptocurrency investing called ‘Bitcon.’ Basically, players are dealt a hand of five cards each and players draw cards in sequence to find out if the market goes up or down, or maybe even collapse. Alongside cards that move the market, there are also other action cards like the ‘Reverse the Market’ card which changes the direction of the current market trend. There’s also the ‘Cash Out’ card which can enable a player to cash out and cause the next player to pick up the remaining cards. Moreover, each deck of Bitcon cards has three ‘Pop’ cards — a card that serves as market collapse warning and when the last card is used the bitcoin market crashes and the game ends.\nThe two creators who designed the Bitcon card game say they kept hearing about individuals doing wild and unbelievable things to obtain bitcoin. Then soon scouring Reddit forums and social media their game concept became an amusing simulation showcasing the risks and rewards tied to cryptocurrency investments.\n“If you like fast-paced strategy games, laugh at people that sold their house to buy bitcoin, or simply want to show grandma how to lose all your cash online,” explains the creators of Bitcon.\nBuy Bitcon — You’ll soon be addicted to losing all your money.\nA Representation of What it Feels Like Riding Markets Up and Down The Bitcon creators say they wanted to create a game that allows the “ thrills of being a big money investor with zero risks.” According to the Kickstarter campaign, a Bitcon strategy tournament can be roughly fifteen minutes of gameplay.\n“Bitcon is our perfect representation of what it feels like riding markets up and down, using strategy to protect yourself but also attack opponents, and be ready to cash out your position before your investment is fully lost,”\nIts 15 minutes of pure strategy, pace, and gambling. Betting addicts we’ve found you a solution .\nBitcon is not the first Kickstarter card game campaign featuring a bitcoin-esque theme as news.Bitcoin.com reported on Bitcoin Empire back in January of 2017. The game featured many cryptocurrency luminaries within the industry and even a Pepe the frog playing card.

Date: in: Altcoin 23 Views\nWhile the birth of cryptocurrencies has been a tool for economic and technological growth among countries around the world, there has been a common problem in the industry – hackers!\nEven as you read this report, a hacker, somewhere in the world is busy trying to phish the data of unsuspecting crypto investors just to hijack their digital assets. Sponsored Links\nAccording to findings by bitcoin.com.news , an average of $9.1 million is lost to hackers every day as a result of phishing , fraud, theft, and hacking.\nAs sad as it may be, only a few numbers of these criminals ever face the hand of justice for their nefarious acts. Good news!\nA British hacker has been busted and sentenced for phishing the data of about 165,000 customers and selling them on the dark web for bitcoin.\nGrant West, 26, was described as “a one-man cyber crime wave,” because he was acting on his own without the assistance of a team.\nWest was sentenced to ten years and eight months in prison. Judge Michael Gledhill gave the verdict at the Southwark Crown Court after West admitted charges including drug dealings, money laundering, and conspiracy to fraud.\n“When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless,” the judge said .\nWest, who was arrested and on his way to London, used his girlfriend’s laptop for his hacking scams.\nWhen the British police raided west’s residence, they found an SD containing the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards. It also included the details of over 500 companies, and seven million phished email addresses with their passwords.\nHis girlfriend, Rachael Brooks, 26, mother of his 9-month-old baby was found with half a kilo of cannabis and £25,000 in cash, and she too was seized by the authorities.\nBrooks was given a community order after pleading guilty of unauthorized access to computer material.\nWest has also hacked many popular brands, including Uber, to steal emails and other valuable details. In 2015, he sent phishing scam emails pretending to represent Just Eat takeaway.\nWest made £2 million worth of the crypto, with £500,000 worth of bitcoin seized by the Cops, while £1.5 million remain untraced, probably hidden in off-shore accounts and crypto investments.\nThis is the ‘first of its kind’ case for the 188-year old London police department.\nNo doubt, the punishment given to West would serve as a lesson to other crypto hackers and hopefully this would be a step towards eradicating crypto scam in the industry.\nDo you think it is possible to remove the element of fraud from the crypto space or do you think otherwise?

Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money.\nPutting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate. And while novel ideas by communist and technocratic thinkers have failed, the Euro – which was devised to help unite former warring nations – is still around.\nRevolutionary Zeal Is Not Enough\nAfter reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: “Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\n“And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,” he concluded.\nWhether it’s true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/economics-nobel-laureate-robert-shiller-examines-bitcoin-in-historical-context/\nbe not idiot", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/economics-nobel-laureate-robert-shiller-examines-bitcoin-in-historical-context/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:41:04.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1ce8797dfddc137d5c8b56b7062616456bfab5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrAIBl9XJDVqQWZkZ4N4yEwEhpX3TG4AuWZdbG7.3QxDIHprJpULuOOOu1z_lU1nLuD.7j0.1k2V9ATTjWttVrWIrNXzXEiSerHkGAhv.EvARc6QDWCh7usFjb5V8reZ.Bo4kSTU9_2B7EQjhjHakBVNmBUW1yEoU-", "site_full": "www.xrpchat.com", "site": "xrpchat.com", "site_section": "https://www.xrpchat.com/forum/5-general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Xrp Chat", "title": "Buy a house with Ripple [XRP], Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH]!

The Skycoin takes these arguments and tries to be the weaknesses of the Bitcoin to iron out and to be a real Alternative to Fiat money.\nThe Skycoin project started already in 2012, with some members from the former Bitcoin developer Team. The company also sees itself as a successor of Bitcoin, with the goal of the original visions of its founder, Satoshi to implement Nakamoto: to be A real Alternative to the demand deposits of financial institutions state – independent and anonymous.\nObjectives and functioning of the Ecosystem\nSkycoin offers the users its own programming language compilable Go programming language was originally developed by Google.\nThe Skycoin (SKY) provides a network architecture. An extensive Ecosystem of applications in the real world, on the Skycoin developed Skywire network, the user is available. The first applications in the Skywire network include Messaging, Social Media – and VPN-applications (Virtual Private Network).\nSkycoin uses for its consensus-finding neither a Proof-of-Work nor Proof-of-Stake algorithm, but a novel consensus Obelisk, which is based on the Web-of-Trust. Each node of the network has stored all the network information. A data falsification is virtually impossible.\nIn Skycoin, there is no Mining. This increases the security of the system, because it is from the ideas of the Miner. Furthermore, there can be no 51% attack.\nAs consideration for the power supply of the network Skycoin offers its users the opportunity to earn Coins. The use of the network is free of charge.\nTransactions within the network can be completed within seconds. Furthermore, Skycoin will be absolutely anonymous. Using the CoinJoin Protocol, it is almost impossible to keep track of transactions of Skycoin. Payment flows are executed in parallel, and transactions from multiple Wallets mixed together . The identification of individual account movements is not then possible.\nThere is a fixed upper limit for number of Coins. You is 100 million the SKY. The Coins will be released in batches slowly.\nThe properties of Skycoin can be summarized as follows: High Scalability", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "skycoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blockchain skycoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T11:52:14.043+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "caefd0ac58550f92ec93af358cc8979555849fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYgF_smZ_DfZPA4HiLF0uMGQyFlSAFJiNeLNP.GYqHYq1GRH_3CUFh169ccg.K9A98EvH1tPkV5Fs_NzNFGdJ1KxYN83okv9c6Rdr5xsmKZszyTe6mXh29c8KrlBuXQg_w9pEgGkyjyg--", "site_full": "www.wesrch.com", "site": "wesrch.com", "site_section": "http://www.wesrch.com/RSS_feed/rss_feed_paper.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WeSRCH.com: Latest Presentations/Papers", "title": "Bitcoin Plunges on Price Manipulation Probe", "title_full": "Bitcoin Plunges on Price Manipulation Probe", "published": "2018-05-27T11:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.wesrch.com/afterhours/User_images/Paper/AEH_1527249847_1.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18562, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "caefd0ac58550f92ec93af358cc8979555849fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYgF_smZ_DfZPA4HiLF0uMGQyFlSAFJiNeLNP.GYqHYq1GRH_3CUFh169ccg.K9A98EvH1tPkV5Fs_NzNFGdJ1KxYN83okv9c6Rdr5xsmKZszyTe6mXh29c8KrlBuXQg_w9pEgGkyjyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T11:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Plunges on Price Manipulation Probe", "text": "Report Abuse Bitcoin prices tumbled to their lowest levels in more than six weeks on Thursday after the U.S. Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into potential price manipulation in the bitcoin market. Not only does the probe threaten the legitimacy of cryptocurrency prices, it also opens the door for stricter regulations on bitcoin trading down the road. According to Bloomberg, sources familiar with the matter say the Justice Department is particularly interested in the practice of spoofing in the bitcoin market. Spoofing involves traders flooding the market with fake orders in an effort to artificially inflate or deflate prices. The report said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is cooperating with federal prosecutors as part of the probe. The investigation is the latest government intervention in the cryptocurrency market, which investors have long celebrated for its decentralized and unregulated status. Cryptocurrency trading hubs China and South Korea have also recently implemented new regulations on cryptocurrency trading in an effort to cut down on fraud and money laundering. Earlier this year, a study by the University of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney found that 25 percent of all bitcoin users and 44 percent of all bitcoin transactions were associated with criminal activity. Bitcoin prices tumbled 4.8 percent on Thursday, briefly dropping below $7,500 and hitting their lowest levels in six weeks. The value of bitcoin has dropped by 44.4 percent so far in 2018, but some bitcoin bulls are sticking to their guns when it comes to the battered cryptocurrency. “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,” Fundstrat analyst Thomas Lee says. “But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.” At the same time, some bitcoin bears, such as Vanguard Group economist Joe Davis, see absolutely no value in the cryptocurrency whatsoever. “I’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible,” Davis wrote earlier this week. “As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.” Fundstrat has a $25,000 price target for bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T22:21:05.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82021a4bcb4c71a6c867cfad84a8a9fdfce75e7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cRxZE.p3laWrqUsXlsR8dDg0QaNCHeIFnN4HK10JFnF6TG0L9O7Jl95Vcj3Alkk9dKxjLTjyZWpy5v_SogUvAI8_N2WoVAPM-", "site_full": "www.gistpunch.com", "site": "gistpunch.com", "site_section": "http://www.gistpunch.com/", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "For Best Entertainment, Sport, and Music", "title": "Do You Need To Sell or Buy Bitcoin in Lagos, or Nigeria as Whole Visit HEre", "title_full": "Do You Need To Sell or Buy Bitcoin in Lagos, or Nigeria as Whole Visit HEre", "published": "2018-05-27T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82021a4bcb4c71a6c867cfad84a8a9fdfce75e7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cRxZE.p3laWrqUsXlsR8dDg0QaNCHeIFnN4HK10JFnF6TG0L9O7Jl95Vcj3Alkk9dKxjLTjyZWpy5v_SogUvAI8_N2WoVAPM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gistpunch (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Do You Need To Sell or Buy Bitcoin in Lagos, or Nigeria as Whole Visit HEre", "text": "DO YOU NEED BITCOIN or Ethereum and also Perfect Money or Other Kind of ECurrency\nDo you want to Sell your Bitcoin or Etherium\nall available at Pufftech Exchange With Instant Funding And Payment of Both E-currency\n Available to buy and also you can sell Visit our Website www.pufftechexchange.com and register afterward you can submit you buy/sell order form if u have any problem or Difficulties kindly send us an email at info@pufftechexchange.com or whats app 08026116103\nWe Do Large Quantities 5,000 - 50,000$ upward\nYou Can Now Sell Your Gift Card To Us and you will be Paid instantly as your card been verified We Buy any Gift Card from USA, ETC iTunes Gift Card.

But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow.\nThe turnout wasnt surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the regions ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency miners.\nThese entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency. The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.\nAs a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum.\nBut as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basins three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can  or should even try to  keep up.\nThe sectors recent growth spurt poses a very different kind of problem than anything we have addressed before, Steve Wright, Chelan County PUD general manager, told the crowd at the May 14 hearing. Determining whether the PUD can handle the growth, Wright said, has required a whole new way of thinking.\nOverwhelming gold rush\nIn a normal year, demand for electric power in Chelan County grows by perhaps 4 megawatts ** enough for around 2,250 homes  as new residents arrive and as businesses start or expand. But since January 2017, as Bitcoin enthusiasts bid up the price of the currency, eager miners have requested a staggering 210 megawatts for mines they want to build in Chelan County. Thats nearly as much as the county and its 73,000 residents were already using. And because it is a public utility, the PUD staff is obligated to consider every request.\nThe scale of some new requests is mind-boggling. Until recently, the largest mines in Chelan County used five megawatts or less. In the past six months, by contrast, miners have requested loads of 50 megawatts and, in several cases, 100 megawatts. By comparison, a fruit warehouse uses around 2.5 megawatts.\nBut its not simply the scale of requests that is perplexing utility staff. Many would-be miners have no understanding of how large power purchases work. In one case this winter, miners from China landed their private jet at the local airport, drove a rental car to the visitor center at the Rocky Reach Dam, just north of Wenatchee, and, according to Chelan County PUD officials, politely asked to see the dam master because we want to buy some electricity. \nBitcoin fever has created other, smaller-scale problems for the utility. Three times a week, on average, utility crews in Chelan County discover unpermitted home miners running computer servers far too large for the electrical grids of residential neighborhoods. In one instance last year, the transformer outside a bootleg miners home overheated and touched off a grass fire, Chelan County PUD officials say.\nIn other cases, utility crews responding to unusual spikes in power usage have found racks of remotely controlled servers whirring away in empty apartments. Worse, when the utility began shutting off power to these so-called rogue operators earlier this year, some of them became so belligerent that the utility is installing security cameras and bulletproof glass at its downtown Wenatchee headquarters.\nBy February, the Bitcoin gold rush, as Wright calls it, had become so overwhelming that Chelan County PUD declared a three-month moratorium on new mines to determine whether the county can absorb even a fraction of that demand. But answering that question was more complex than the utility anticipated  and at the recent hearing, the commission voted to extend the freeze another three months.\nAll told, the three PUDs in the mid-Columbia Basin are considering miners requests for well over 2,000 megawatts of power  equal to roughly two-thirds of the total hydropower generated by the Basins five hydroelectric dams. And while every request wont become a contract, the rapid demand is forcing officials at all three public utilities to rethink how they sell power.\nThe biggest issue, of course, is power rates. Currently, residents in Chelan County pay around 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, or about a third what Seattleites pay and around one fifth of the national average. Rates in Douglas and Grants are in that same ballpark\nThose bargain rates are possible largely because the Basins five dams generate around six times what the region can use locally. Much of the surplus is exported, at premium prices, to outside buyers such as Puget Sound Energy, and those outside sales subsidize local rates.\nBut if the utilities are selling more of their power to local Bitcoin miners, theyre exporting less power at those premium prices, which makes it harder to keep local rates low. Further, because much of the surplus is currently committed in long-term contracts, supplying miners with all the megawatts they want might require the utilities do something virtually unprecedented: buy power on the open market, at prices far above what locals have come to expect.\nAdd to this the many millions of dollars the utilities would need to invest in new substations, transmission lines, and other infrastructure, and suddenly, it becomes conceivable that this new industry might signal the end to decades of cheap power.\nMore at link.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.seattletimes.com/business/bitcoin-backlash-as-miners-suck-up-electricity-stress-power-grids-in-central-washington/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T00:23:42.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87f63148603ed686d642df2513ca589a3aab6796", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT0UG.8VfUnTzqBUEb4h_Ao-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "the benefits of managing bitcoin", "title_full": "the benefits of managing bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T10:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.039, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87f63148603ed686d642df2513ca589a3aab6796", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT0UG.8VfUnTzqBUEb4h_Ao-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daday23", "published": "2018-05-27T10:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "the benefits of managing bitcoin", "text": "With bitcoin the economy of a country will decrease and it has a lot of benefits that we can get and thru bitcoin all transaction make it easier and faster.Managing bitcoin make our life better and specially to its investors it gave a better profit.Bitcoin at first is really hard but once you understand and practice it a good way to success is what we will going to have.
