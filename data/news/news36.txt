Intriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the 6th day of every month. Having topped out in the $20, 000 neighbourhood in mid December 2017, the cryptocurrency fell to a 2018 low of $6, 000 on Feb. Since that time, the cryptocurrency has been limited to a narrowing range of prices, as indicated by the triangle pattern in the chart below.\nWhat is more intriguing is that major price highs and lows over that time have formed around the 6th day of every month. BTC daily chart. The above chart shows: Bitcoin bottomed out or turned higher from $6, 000 on Feb. 6 and $6, 500 on Apr 6. The lower highs – $11, 700 and $9, 990 – were created on March 5 and May 5, respectively. The annual high of $17, 252 was also set on Jan. Plainly, the tide rebounds in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the 6th day of every month. As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $7, 433 on Bitfinex – down 34 percent from the bearish reversal point of $9, 990, dated May 6, meaning the bulls are currently on the defensive.\nPassing through the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency appears likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this instance, bitcoin could revisit triangle resistance, currently located at $9, 225. And on the other hand, long term technical studies are biased to the bears, that wasn’t the case on previous occasions. For example, Crypto-currency has found its acceptance beneath the 50 week moving average for the very first time since 2015. Further, a 5 month and 10 month moving average bearish crossover lately occurred for the very first time in 4 years.\nTherefore, as always, nothing is guaranteed with regards to bitcoin price movements. But, just maybe, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid tomorrow, in line with the historic pattern. Still, it’d be too soon to call a bull reversal, given the bearish long term technical developments, and traders would want to see more evidence – like a high volume break above the weekly high of $7, 779 – before assuming that the bulls were back in charge.

Your resident, forward-thinking, Bitcoin holding US Senate candidate from Missouri is at it again. Austin Petersen, who in a recent Gravis Marketing poll was shown to be leading primary contender Josh Hawley in the battle to unseat Democrat incumbent Claire McCaskill, received an attempted donation of $224,000 worth of Bitcoin this Monday. A rough estimate given Bitcoin’s current valuation ($7,400) would put the donation total at nearly 35 Bitcoins from the anonymous sender.\nThe federal limit for donations allowed is $5,400 a person. But that didn’t keep one diehard cryptocurrency advocate from trying to give nearly a quarter of a million dollars worth of Bitcoin to Petersen’s senate campaign. Petersen, a former Libertarian presidential candidate, has long been an open advocate for cryptocurrency. His campaign is on track to post the highest total for cryptocurrency donations in the history of American politics. Republican Candidate Austin Petersen Accepts the Largest Campaign Contribution Paid in BTC https://t.co/13LXmgh21K #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/z8q5w3E1tm\n— Bitcoin News (@BTCTN) February 11, 2018\nA staunch critic of the Federal Reserve and the centralized monetary policy of the American government, Petersen has pointed to cryptocurrency as a new horizon in the liberty movement. Speaking with the St. Louis Dispatch in March, Petersen was blunt in his support: “I am a big fan of the digital currency community because of what it represents, which is ultimately decentralization.”\nPetersen’s fans were quick to bemoan the federal donation limit which keeps the Senate candidate from accepting the massive donation. Congratulations poured in from across the internet. With every passing day, Petersen’s support grows rapidly in the cryptocurrency community.\n— Austin Petersen (@AP4Liberty) May 31, 2018\nDue to limitations of the amount a candidate can receive, the Petersen team had to send back the donated Bitcoin to its original owner. Supporters were eager to suggest ways to accept the donation either through smaller blocks or by establishing a Super PAC expressly for the campaign. Others cheerfully suggested they could accept the donation into their own personal crypto wallets.\nWith the Senate race heating up and the August primaries in sight, Petersen and his grassroots band of “Freedom Ninjas” are building on unmistakeable momentum. With recent positive publicity from Glenn Beck, The Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro and Kyle Kashuv, Petersen’s team is turning what once looked like a longshot campaign into a miserable dogfight for perceived frontrunner Josh Hawley. Austin Petersen Crushes Dem Claire McCaskill And Republican Rival Josh Hawley In New Poll https://t.co/NihRa6pTXt\n— Kyle Kashuv (@KyleKashuv) May 28, 2018\nWhatever the results are in August, Petersen has led a campaign built on the foundational ideas of decentralized governance as written in our constitution. While other politicians fumble over their words when discussing cryptocurrency, Petersen has been arguably the most outspoken and clearly defined advocate for alternative currency in this election cycle and the huge donation is no surprise. Ironically enough, it has taken a generally conservative figure to push a progressive position on the issue of centralized, inflationary monetary politics that has hurt the middle and lower class of this country.\nFor more information on Austin Petersen’s campaign for US Senate visit:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.austinpetersen.com/gravis_poll", "https://twitter.com/KyleKashuv/status/1001242487426551808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/NihRa6pTXt", "https://twitter.com/AP4Liberty/status/1002211064422027266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/z8q5w3E1tm", "https://twitter.com/TheNewTreasury", "https://twitter.com/BTCTN/status/962811509553459205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/yUoLiXL0pO", "https://t.co/13LXmgh21K", "https://twitter.com/AP4Liberty/status/1003804752931680256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "austin petersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire mccaskill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer kellogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh hawley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gravis marketing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:55:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35be74bdc161aa57822a92e286eb4020b9dbaf00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pFVyNi9hY0.xP8XSy9cmmXogGb4eB0xfRXriWOZ5cZm2ZbwZ4KF_ZHy5SzRtZF5Jr2oOpwkYEpz7ge9CcV0fA1JYdfQY_Z.gWt9bNWtrmSIc", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "The Bitcoin Lightning Network: A Technical Primer", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Lightning Network: A Technical Primer", "published": "2018-06-05T18:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*H6YpjFL607i_qcDg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35be74bdc161aa57822a92e286eb4020b9dbaf00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pFVyNi9hY0.xP8XSy9cmmXogGb4eB0xfRXriWOZ5cZm2ZbwZ4KF_ZHy5SzRtZF5Jr2oOpwkYEpz7ge9CcV0fA1JYdfQY_Z.gWt9bNWtrmSIc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T18:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Lightning Network: A Technical Primer", "text": "The Bitcoin Lightning Network: A Technical Primer TL;DR: The Lightning Network is a protocol layer intended to provide instantaneous, trustless Bitcoin payments. In this article, I walk through the construction process for Lightning Channels and illustrate how multi-hop transfers are initiated. This article is the third piece in a multi-part series where I attempt to deep dive into notable cryptoasset projects. Background The Lightning Network is Layer 2 infrastructure built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, designed to increase transactional throughput. Bitcoin has a hardcoded upper bound limit on the number of transactions it can process. In traditional payment rails, ledgers are updated every few seconds and can achieve high degrees of scalability. These systems reach finality quickly and efficiently due to their centralized structure: clients communicate directly with the master server, who make ledger alterations in real time as notice is provided. Image Source Bitcoin faces inherent challenges since the system utilizes distributed architecture. When new information needs to be appended to the ledger, that information must be redundantly pushed across every participating server inside the network. These servers must parse through the data and reach consensual agreement on which transactions they intend to accept and write to database, and which to reject. The difficulty in this scenario arises when multiple servers have conflicting views on transactional sequencing. Each node in the ecosystem maintains equivalent weight, so without top-down authority to establish a canonical vision, the system would eventually stall out if participating validators are unable to reach consensus. Image Source Bitcoin introduces the concept of mining to guarantee network progression and prevent ledger fragmentation. Miners contribute computational power from specialized hardware to earn the right to propose ledger alterations during iteration rounds which occur roughly every 10 minutes. A mathematical challenge is included in each round. If a miner is able to find a solution, they earn the right to establish canonical vision of the ledger, which the rest of the network accepts based off protocol rules. When a claimant proposes a solution, other nodes can verify integrity of the solution. Peers will only recognize the claimant’s ledger version if the solution is valid. When we talk about “vision” of the ledger, we are referring to the construction of blocks. Blocks are aggregations of transactions compressed into a singular file unit. When a miner “solves” a block, they earn the right to inscribe their view of the ledger to the blockchain, an immutable database containing an archive of previous network transactions. Transactions are simply lines of code, so they have deterministic size. With the blocks having an upper bound limit at 1MB, the system can process ~7 transactions per second (tps). In contrast, networks like VISA can support ~50,000 tps. Overview The Lightning Network utilizes the concept of payment channels to provide bi-directional monetary transfers with near-instantaneous speed, zero counterparty risk, and negligent fees. Lightning Network is designed to alleviate scalability concerns surrounding the Bitcoin protocol. The system routes around the bottlenecks of universal consensus by settling transactions off chain, avoiding latency and computational redundancies that plague blockchains. Lightning claims transactional processing capabilities in the millions of tps. Funding Payment Channel The first step involves an initial funding transaction where each party deposits BTC into a 2-of-2 multisignature address. Once deposited, each participant has full guarantee of security, since any forward movement of funds will require signature authentication from both parties. But what if the channel is unable to progress forward after the funding transaction? If the opposing party becomes unresponsive or loses their private key, any balance locked up in that channel is permanently lost. Thus, both sides of the agreement need insurance against counterparty risk that may ensue. To solve this dilemma, users draft refund transactions and have their counterparty sign. These transactions are constructed before either individual deposits to the multisignature address, and allows for revocation of the original funds back to channel depositors. Alice drafts a refund transaction with specified outputs back to her personal address, signs the transaction with her private key, then forwards it to Bob. Bob signs and returns the now-validated message. Alice tucks away this transaction away as leverage for a future mishap. In the event Bob becomes unresponsive, Alice simply broadcasts the transaction to the network, creating an escape route to pull her balance out of the multisig. Bob performs this same scripting function and has Alice sign. Both parties are now protected. Standard BTC scripting rules require the spender to designate an output they are spending from, and reference it within the transaction. The problem with the above scenario is that in order for Bob and Alice to generate refund transactions, they need to reference outputs that don’t yet exist . This requires alteration to protocol rules via a softfork. SIGHASH_NOINPUT flag is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would allows users to spend from an unspecified output. Ratification of the proposal, which is currently under review as BIP-118, would allow these refund parameters to exist. The following steps narrate the order of operations: Bob and Alice create a 2-of-2 multisig address, each possessing a keypair. Bob and Alice create deposit transactions from personal wallets to the multisig account, but do not sign and broadcast. Bob and Alice both create independent refund transactions from the 2-of-2 account using SIGHASH_NOINPUT. If both parties plan to deposit 1 BTC to the channel, Alice’s refund transaction will read “Send Alice 1 BTC”. She will sign with her key, and ask Bob to do the same for her. Likewise, Bob mirrors the cycle, creating a transaction which reads “Send Bob 1 BTC”, signed with his key. He requests Alice to sign. Both parties sign and return the counterparties request from Step 3 with no liability risk. Once both parties have received signed refunds from their counterparty, they broadcast personal deposit transactions from Step 2. Commitment Advances With funds locked up in the multisig account, a “channel” is now created. Participants can issue fully valid transaction scripts to one another via private medium, and both parties can accept these instruments of payment as valid without having to broadcast the payment on-chain. In doing so, these commitments act as a form of promissory note with enforceable guarantees backed by the Bitcoin blockchain, all while avoiding the bottlenecks and costs of universal consensus . If circumstance requires, either party can push the latest commitment version to the blockchain and close out the channel without requiring approval from their counterparty. Problems arise when it becomes economically advantageous for a participant to push a previous commitment to the blockchain. Returning to our example, after both depositing a 1 BTC balance, Bob sends 0.5 BTC to Alice inside the channel. His balance will now show 0.5 BTC, and Alice’s will read 1.5 BTC. But remember, Bob has his initial refund TX, signed by Alice, that allocates 1 BTC back to himself. Bob is now incentivized to push this outdated transaction to the network and make off with Alice’s money. Thus, we need some method to invalidate previous commitments. Commitment Transactions When Bob and Alice want to advance the state of the channel, they need a way to autonomously enforce their contracts. This is done through commitment transactions. Suppose Bob wishes to send Alice 0.5 BTC. Each party creates two near-identical transactions spending the same input values. These transactions operate similar to a RBF or a Doublespend - if both transactions are pushed to the blockchain, only one of them will ultimately confirm and be appended to the ledger since they reference the same input values. Bob and Alice carefully construct these transactions in a manner that it is deterministically provable which one will be included into a block first. Bob creates a transaction by referencing a set of outputs, and signs with his key. We call this transaction C1Bob (Commitment1Bob), which he forwards to Alice. Alice mirrors this action, creating C1Alice and forwards to Bob. Because these transactions are originating from the 2-of-2 multisig, neither party’s script is valid until both signatures are transcribed. Once Bob and Alice put their stamp of approval on each other’s commitments, they are voluntarily accepting the potential of their counterparty broadcast the transaction at any point in the future (thereby closing the channel). Bob cannot push the transaction he constructed to the network, since he doesn’t possess Alice’s private key. Bob can only broadcast Alice’s version, and Alice can only broadcast Bob’s. The above illustration describes the redemption paths if a commitment were broadcast on-chain. If Alice were to push her transaction to the network, she would initiate two events. The first would immediately unlock Bob’s balance, allowing him to transfer his funds. The second would trigger a countdown on her funds. Alice will have to wait 1,000 blocks in order for her outputs to unlock. Once this timespan has elapsed, her funds will become available for redemption. This process is mirrored on Bob’s commitment. If he pushes his version to the network, Alice’s funds are immediately unlocked, while he has to wait 1,000 blocks. These lockup intervals are set to mitigate counterparty risk. We introduce the concept of Revocable Sequence Maturity Contracts (RSMC) as a means to invalidate previous commitments. This occurs via the scripting flag CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV). CSV’s are a way to dynamically lock up bitcoins over a predefined time interval, and is enforced by the Bitcoin blockchain rather than users themselves. CSV checks for the current block height (aka the sequence ) from the moment the transaction is included in a block, and verifies that the encumbrance scripts are met. In the example above, it is the CSV encumbrance in the transaction that forces Alice/Bob to wait 1,000 blocks for their funds to become redeemable. This creates a bonded deposit window where a plaintiff can present a breached remedy tool in the event the counterparty tries to broadcast an outdated commitment. Creating Breached Remedy Commitments When Bob and Alice want to advance the state of the channel, they need a way to invalidate previous commitments. Bob and Alice repeat the commitment process by constructing a new 2-of-2 multisig account (aka C2Bob, C2Alice) with a fresh set of keys. They reference their outputs, enact similar 1,000 block CSV scripts, sign the transaction with their own keys and pass along to their counterparty. Their counterparty tucks this transaction away. However, before finalizing the new C2Bob/C2Alice commitment schemes, both parties disclose their private keys used in C1Bob/C1Alice. Once this occurs, each party is protected from publication of outdated commitments. As mentioned earlier, if Bob closes out the channel, Alice’s funds are immediately spendable. Bob’s money on the other hand is locked up for 1,000 blocks by the CSV encumbrance. If Bob tries to cheat the system by broadcasting an outdated commitment whenever financially incentivizing to do so, those funds are not immediately accessible. Alice will see that Bob is trying to cheat her, and use her breach remedy “tool”. This tool allows Alice to spend the 1,000 block encumbered funds immediately if she can provide Bob’s private key. Alice is capable of fulfilling this obligation now that the channel state has advanced, because Bob has voluntarily relinquished the key to her in the last round. Thus, Alice can not only ensure that she won’t be cheated out of the BTC she is owed, but will be able to walk away with the entirety of Bob’s balance, making additional money. Thus, Bob is highly incentivized not to try and cheat the system by publishing outdated commitments, since Alice will be able to walk with his entire deposit. Conversely, if Alice tries to pull a similar trick on Bob, he can walk with the entirety of her deposit. This creates incentive models where both parties are highly incentivized to act altruistically. Cooperative Channel Closeout When either party wants to close out the channel, they can do so cooperatively by disregarding all outstanding promissory notes and constructing a normal transaction from the original 2-of-2 escrow. This transaction would pays out the respective balance to each member, based off the most recent commitments. Because the outstanding promissory notes are backed with full guarantee by the blockchain, both parties have an incentive to collaborate . Neither individual has to go through the frictionary process of paying additional on-chain fees, nor lose out on opportunity costs of time having their BTC locked up by the CSV encumbrances for 1,000 blocks. Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC’s) and Multi-hop Transfers HTLC’s are forms of transactional encumbrances which use hashlocks (locking scripts that ensure certain data is known) and timelocks (restricts future spending of outputs until a predetermined date) as a way to enforce provisions on a transaction. Both types of encumbrances are enforced by the blockchain rather than channel counterparties. The concept is fairly simple, and serves as a way to extend payment channels beyond a bi-directional state. Lightning Network will have the ability to route channels deterministically through multiple parties through a process called multi-hop transfers. At first, Lightning might not be very appealing unless two participants plan to remunerate very frequently, since opening a new channel requires locking up assets via an on-chain broadcasted transaction. Bob having unique channels with many participants means less money in his wallet for discretionary spending, significantly reducing the versatility of his funds. Lightning alleviates these concerns by introducing an effective path finding algorithm between network participants, and linking their channels together via HTLC’s. Bob and Alice are two individuals who want to transact, but don’t have an existing channel open. If both parties have a mutual channel connection with Steve, they can still route the transaction with full guarantee of atomic settlement. This works by Bob paying Steve, who in turn pays Alice. Bob has now trustlessly paid Alice without needing to open a channel with her. If the relationships between participants are extremely isolated, we can keep introducing more intermediaries to form a lineage robust enough to facilitate payments. Bob(the sender) initiates the multi-hop process by communicating directly with Alice(the beneficiary). Bobs asks Alice to create a randomly generated secret R , which remains private to Alice. Bob asks Alice for a hash of R , called the preimage, but not the plaintext version of R itself. Bob subsequently specifies only to disclose R to an intermediary party, Steve, in exchange for 1 BTC. So, Alice hashes R , and sends a copy of the preimage to Bob. Bob takes this preimage to Steve, and offers a 1 BTC bounty if he can produce the hash’s plaintext version, R . Steve accepts the offer, and goes to Alice with an offering of 1 BTC in exchange for the secret value. Note that in this situation, Steve front runs his own capital to make this exchange with Alice. Alice, seeing this offer of 1 BTC in exchange for an arbitrary secret R , accepts the proposition and gives the value of R to Steve, just as she was instructed earlier by Bob. Steve then hands R to Bob in order to claim his bounty. In this example, Bob has found a trustless way to pay Alice, without having to go through the burden of opening a channel with her. If Bob and Alice lack a mutual contact to route the channel through, we can keep introducing more intermediary liquidity providers until a connection is made. For example, if Bob has an open channel with Steve, and Alice has an open channel with Sarah, and Sarah and Steve have a channel together, a payment can be initiated. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV) vs. CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) What is the difference between a CLTV and a CSV? Both are examples of timelock encumbrances, and are used to accomplish similar goals. Suppose a CLTV encumbrance is placed on an output for 10 blocks. The current BTC block height is b=500,000. Once the blockchain hits b=500,010 the outputs unlock and become spendable. The time at which the original transaction gets a confirmation is irrelevant to the spender. In contrast, a CSV script is based entirely on the time the original transaction is included into a block. Suppose a CSV script is placed on an output for 10 blocks. The current BTC block is b= 500,000. Once this transaction is broadcast, it sits unconfirmed for 5 blocks. After 5 blocks ensue, it finally gets picked up and included at b=500,005. In this scenario, the timer begins once that transaction gets its first confirmation. The CSV encumbered output doesn’t become spendable until 10 subsequent blocks at b=500,015. Conversely, if the original transaction receives its first confirmation at b=500,003 then the outputs becomes spendable at b=500,013. In summary, a CSV sets a dynamic encumbrance that makes an output spendable after a specified number of confirmations once the original transaction is included in a block. In contrast, with CLTV you are specifying when the output will become spendable based off block height. This means that the output’s encumbrance status is completely independent of the mining process. Constructing Hashed Timelock Contracts In our previous example, we presented a basic overview of how a multihop transfer can occur, but failed to articulate how to create an enforceable contract on the blockchain to facilitate those functions. For example, what if Alice fails to produce the secret value after Bob transfers her the bitcoin? Or what if Bob revokes his bounty commitment to Steve after acquiring the secret from Alice? In both scenarios, Steve has lost money. In order to create a trustless layer of commitments, we build off similar RSMC properties outlined in earlier sections, but add a few twists. After Bob communicates directly with Alice and receives a copy of her preimage, he constructs a hashed-timelock contract (HTLC) transaction with Steve. This contract has two paths for output redemption. The first is a “delivery” path which sends Steve 1 BTC immediately if he can produce the secret R . The second is a “timeout” path which allows Bob to refund himself in the event Steve cannot produce the secret. This is accomplished using a CLTV flag instead of the CSV as in previous examples. In the transactional script, Bob sets the timeout length of the CTLV to 1,000 blocks. This means Steve essentially has 1,000 blocks to obtain R from Alice and claim the 1 BTC bounty via the “delivery” path. If he waits longer than this time, he loses guaranteed insurance that he can claim the bounty safely. Steve mirrors this same transactional script with Alice, front running his own personal capital in the process. If Alice wants to claim the 1 BTC sitting in escrow, all she needs to do is reveal the secret R . Once Steve has R , he can turn around and use it to pull the 1 BTC out of escrow sitting between him and Bob. Everyone gets paid. Importantly though, these “timeout” intervals must decrease in length as the chain progresses right to left . The timeout between Alice and Steve must expire earlier than the timeout between Steve and Bob. If they expire simultaneously, Bob runs the risk of transferring his funds to Alice near the end of expiration, and then having Bob’s “timeout” unlocking before he has time to grab his funds out of escrow. In this scenario, Steve would be left doing the bagholding, since he front ran capital to Alice but was not able to collect from Bob. To make matters even more challenging, blocks are solved in random 10-minute intervals. There is no inherent guarantee that a subsequent block will be solved 10 minutes after a previous. It could happen 1 second afterward. This is why CLTVs are used instead of CSVs. Thus, it is imperative that participants provide ample blocks between channel “timeouts” to prevent loss of funds. If Steve cannot obtain R from Alice (she is a fraudulent actor, becomes unresponsive etc.), nothing is hurt. He simply lets the channel expire and revokes his money out of the escrow by using the “timeout” path. This will set off a chain reaction, where Bob will revoke his funds out of escrow once they timeout. Though the parties may experience opportunity costs of locked-up capital, they have full reassurance that they can ultimately reclaim those escrowed funds. Interestingly, disruption of the channel somewhere along the line does not destroy payment guarantee, but actually strengthens it. Suppose Sarah fulfills her end of the obligation and provides Steve with R , but Steve remains unresponsive and does not update their channel balance. In such a situation, Sarah is still capable of obtaining the 1 BTC she is owed through the HTLC contract. If Sarah uses the “Delivery” Path, R becomes publicly available on the blockchain; she has to disclose it in the metadata of the transaction to unlock the encumbrance and receive her BTC. Intermediary liquidity providers can extract this information off the blockchain and use it to unlock their escrow channels immediately, without ever having to wait for their correspondent to reveal R to them. This structure provides cryptographic certainty that each claimant will be able to receive their capital, so long as they push the TX before the CLTV encumbrance expires. Recap Sequence of events for a C2Bob broadcast Sequence of events for a C2Alice broadcast Final Closeout The beautiful thing about Lightning Network is that all these described provisions will rarely take place on-chain. Participants can avoid broadcast of all these intermediary steps and simply pay one another out at the conclusion of the channel using traditional payment terms. These intermediary technicalities exist for the sole purpose of protection. Participants essentially load a gun, then handing it over to the opposing channel member with instructions to shoot if they act dishonestly. Incentives are aligned to follow the rules by constructing channel operations in such a manner. Thus, altruistic behavior is a rational assumption. If participants act dishonestly or become disconnected for extended periods, the Bitcoin blockchain acts as an enforcement mechanism to ensure integrity of commitment balances.

From today’s (June 1) price of $7,433.14, that’s a gain of 13,353%.\nAnd right now, he believes there’s a spark that will shoot Bitcoin into the stratosphere.\nOn May 30, McAfee tweeted a story about how a crisis in Italy could lead to a global stock market sell-off.\nAnd that could lead to a race for everyone on earth to own a Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, as there will only be 21 million ever mined.\nHow the New European Financial Crisis Could Send Bitcoin Soaring Italy is already $2 trillion in debt, and investors are worried a sweeping wave of populism could cause the country to leave the European Union (EU) and abandon the euro or create the next European financial crisis.\nItaly’s party heads in the Five Star Movement and the League are trying to form a coalition, but things are not going smoothly.\nThat could lead to another election in July.\nMembers of Italy’s new populist government have previously threatened to pull Italy – a founding EU member and its third-largest economy – out of the bloc, just like the United Kingdom did in 2016.\nBut they are also threatening a new financial crisis as they plan to boost spending and slash revenue despite Italy’s massive debt. That could devalue the euro or lead to another European bailout fight.\nIf Italy’s debt woes continue, they will create serious uncertainty about the euro and government bonds, and that sort of uncertainty makes investors pessimistic, which could tank markets.\nItalian five-year bond prices are already plummeting. Yields have surged to 2.3% on May 30, from just 0.6% previously, according to Business Insider . Lower yields are a sign investors are confident they’ll be repaid, so rapidly rising yields mean investor confidence in Italy’s solvency is plummeting.\nPlus, the euro also dropped to its lowest level against the dollar in 10 months, $1.15, on May 30.\nThe panic then spread across the globe.\nOn May 30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 245 points, and the stock exchanges in South Korea, Shanghai, Singapore, and Hong Kong all slid at least 1%.\nOn top of all this, there will be continued market volatility thanks to Brexit, potential tariff wars between the United States, China, Canada, and Mexico, an economic crisis in Venezuela, and tensions between the United States and North Korea.\nIt’s not surprising that some investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe-haven investment. After all, its value can’t be torpedoed by political disagreements or overzealous governments.\nMcAfee could be right that the troubles in Italy could help Bitcoin prices start to climb.\nBut the real windfalls will come, as he’s said before, when everyone realizes the true power decentralization and blockchain technology will bring to the world.\nAnd when you see how high Bitcoin prices could climb when the world understands the power of crypto, you can’t afford to be on the wrong side of history.\n*This has been a guest post by Money Morning *\nRelated: The Best Blockchain Stocks to Buy in 2018\nThe post John McAfee Says This Event Could Shoot Bitcoin into the Stratosphere appeared first on Growth Stock Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://moneymorning.com/", "https://moneymorning.com/2017/12/04/john-mcafee-sets-1-million-price-target-for-bitcoin/", "https://moneymorning.com/active-premiums/the-best-place-to-buy-bitcoins-a-step-by-step-guide-for-beginners/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "five star movement", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:40:05.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee0abc85844e0d6523332d90360e0a1b498bedd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pUKtw9WG24bVTYPBlOz4BpWCdjYerpRVu.YM8uptkaKveILjEGILZ7Z7GF7z8T1ADP9ru0vBFATY.kVytfOvxFS4C5N63lwOt0g6ETellUOI-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: Here are the top 10 cryptocurrencies at the moment", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: Here are the top 10 cryptocurrencies at the moment", "published": "2018-06-05T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RTS1IN5D-770x433.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee0abc85844e0d6523332d90360e0a1b498bedd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pUKtw9WG24bVTYPBlOz4BpWCdjYerpRVu.YM8uptkaKveILjEGILZ7Z7GF7z8T1ADP9ru0vBFATY.kVytfOvxFS4C5N63lwOt0g6ETellUOI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-06-05T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: Here are the top 10 cryptocurrencies at the moment", "text": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: Here are the top 10 cryptocurrencies at the moment by 0\nReproduction of news articles, photos, videos or any other content in whole or in part in any form or medium without express writtern permission of moneycontrol.com is prohibited.

He’s about as eccentric as imagined, defiantly taking on his government through the issuance of a proprietary, local money. It was a way to get out from under gouging state-backed banks. Close to half a decade later, and after a crackdown, his little hamlet is thriving as a result of tapping the digital universe to cure their monetary ills. Advertisements\nAlso read: DOJ Crypto Investigation Tanks Prices, Fundstrat Welcomes Adult Supervision Russian Farmer Living the Crypto Revolution\n“I don’t want to expand because it will bring obligations I’m not ready for. I’m not ready to save the world or even Russia, I want to be comfortable and I want to share this comfort with the community,” Mikhail Shlyapnikov told CNN Money . The expansion he speaks of revolves around his personal economic odyssey spurred by banking cartels and their double digit interest premiums on access to capital, Russian rubles. Mikhail Shlyapnikov\nКолио́ново (Kolionovo) is little over an hour by car from Moscow. That was just enough space for Mr. Shlyapnikov to hospice a cancer diagnosis. It’s a farming village, population probably around a couple dozen. It was a chance to escape city life. That was nearly a decade ago, and almost immediately the iconoclast former banker set about changing things.\nMr. Shlyapnikov explained, “I didn’t want to suffocate and be a slave of the banks. So I had to invent my own money. And I did it. I’m my own bank, government, regulator.” Indeed, around 2010 he led the charge to stop politicians entering the hamlet, insisting they prove mental fitness. Only a few years later, he launched his “kolion” to purposefully usurp the ruble. Crypto’s Bright Russian Farming Future\nKolion in its 2014 iteration was paper. That was all it took for his arrest, as a Russian court deemed kolion illegal about a year later. Spring of last year, undeterred, Mr. Shlyapnikov seized on initial coin offering (ICO) mania, raising half a million dollars. “We now have about $2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,” he noted . “This way we can attract real money into the business.”\nThe village’s crypto has 500 bitcoin backing it in reserve, almost $4 million worth. Kolions aren’t mined, and no fiat is paired with it. Instead, Kolionovoians can earn it through a concept he calls ‘plowing,’ which involves trading labor in exchange. Kolions can also be purchased with other, more established cryptos.\nHis vision has turned out to be fortuitous. Russian economic prospects can be seen as immediately bleak: the country faces growing sanction levies on top of sometime contracting markets. The village and its neighbors, who both are incorporating the crypto into their daily lives more and more, are effectively insulated from wild downturns. Such was not the case only a few short years ago.\nIs this the model for crypto’s future?

ETH vs BTC Price Spread Moving Higher\nA look at the four-hour Ether/Bitcoin spread chart shows ETH recouping earlier losses and pushing higher against the market leader, BTC . The chart also shows an ascending triangle formation nearing completion which could see the spread move higher back towards the recent high made on May 20. While based on a short-term chart – normal ascending triangles are based on a longer-term timeframe – a break and close above the horizontal line could indicate further upside. The 20-dma is also trading above the 50-dma highlighting bullish short-term momentum while the RSI indicator is trading mid-market, indicating the market is neither oversold or overbought. The trade also offers traders the opportunity to partially remove crypto-space risk which should offer a layer of protection compared to a position against a fiat currency if market volatility picks-up.\nA comprehensive guide to Ether (ETH)\nA look at the latest IG Client Sentiment Report shows that retail traders are 77.3% net-long of Bitcoin and 91.0% net-long of Ether. While this is a contrarian indicator – bearish for both – daily and weekly changes in net-longs and net-shorts impact on overall retail sentiment.

Source: GoogleTrends\nGoogle Trends analyzes different ‘periods of popularity’ for individual web searches. The value of ‘100’ on their site is given to a specific term that is being searched at its peak of popularity. Bitcoin (BTC) reached its all-time record high of $20,000 a coin in mid-December 2017 and has been dropping ever since.\n>> Bitcoin Price Manipulation?\nBull or Bear?\nBefore Tom Lee, Nick Colas was the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin back in 2013, and he is bearish on BTC at the moment. Colas spoke to CNBC yesterday and states that he has yet to see new adopters wanting to buy Bitcoin recently, and with any new technology new adopters make it more valuable.\nColas gives to reasons as to why investors should halt on purchasing the cryptocurrency. First, google searches are down over 90% since Bitcoin’s peak in December and second, Bitcoin wallet growth has slowed down since last year.\nWith that being said, Colas believes that the sharp drop in December and January was the crypto ‘bubble’ popping, but he’s a strong believer in its structure and technology.\nNegatives Across The Board\nMost top 10 cryptocurrencies reached their top search peaks on Google, back in the last weeks of 2017 and the first week of 2018.\nEOS is the only exception to this, as it reached its peak searches this past week as it launched its main net. Most searches for the cryptocurrency came from Nevada and Arizona, within the United States.\nTron (TRX) launched its main net a week ago and barely received a spike in Google search traffic.\nDo you think investors now are just ‘HODLing’ and not checking the news every day or do you think individuals have just lost interest in cryptocurrency?\nLeave your opinions and comments below.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocurrencynews.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-manipulation", "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chelsea roh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick colas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google trends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "googletrends google trends", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:03:33.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cb7834a154515f14e0ed5ea9fdeb167024bea06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQeclKoGN9S5e4A4ZPOAL7gnmer4fJxT5loyO6z0102R2xDtGN_kS6E4Ov6WQq_f0C2bHoWWxhxb6XjnPFCw6vub4ivEOs..oU-", "site_full": "itafx.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://itafx.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Italian Forex Group", "title": "Bitcoin ancora in discesa, ridotto l?interesse per le cripto", "title_full": "Bitcoin ancora in discesa, ridotto l?interesse per le cripto", "published": "2018-06-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cb7834a154515f14e0ed5ea9fdeb167024bea06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQeclKoGN9S5e4A4ZPOAL7gnmer4fJxT5loyO6z0102R2xDtGN_kS6E4Ov6WQq_f0C2bHoWWxhxb6XjnPFCw6vub4ivEOs..oU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Italian Forex Group (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ancora in discesa, ridotto l?interesse per le cripto", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:00:42.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d219f1230c2fd6cb54e8fe46ea5b59e561364d95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMIvgLjjsfrT54iQgPYBe93.GYDz_pVKhods91Izspqekngcq2SCmcfkp._IyxYuactfYaPUdX5JUJFrgWjngK.kPMrqOCJ4BUA--", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "United Bitcoin (UBTC) Trading 16% Higher Over Last 7 Days", "title_full": "United Bitcoin (UBTC) Trading 16% Higher Over Last 7 Days", "published": "2018-06-05T17:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2293.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d219f1230c2fd6cb54e8fe46ea5b59e561364d95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMIvgLjjsfrT54iQgPYBe93.GYDz_pVKhods91Izspqekngcq2SCmcfkp._IyxYuactfYaPUdX5JUJFrgWjngK.kPMrqOCJ4BUA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephan Jacobs", "published": "2018-06-05T17:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "United Bitcoin (UBTC) Trading 16% Higher Over Last 7 Days", "text": "United Bitcoin (UBTC) Trading 16% Higher Over Last 7 Days Posted by Stephan Jacobs | Jun 5th, 2018\nUnited Bitcoin (CURRENCY:UBTC) traded up 2.4% against the dollar during the one day period ending at 8:00 AM Eastern on May 29th.

The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country’s lower courts in a case dating back to last year.\nIn September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.\nAccording to the court, the government could not seize Ahn’s bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren’t tangible.\n“It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,” the court ruled. “Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.”\nNow, the country’s Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court’s decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea’s highest court, it didn’t hold up.\nSeeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it.\n“Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,” the ruling from this Tuesday reads. “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.”\nAhn’s sentence will remain the same, but he’ll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn’s transactions on Bitcoin’s ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.\n“[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,” the court ruling states.\nThe ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After effecting a domestic ban on ICOs in September of last year, the South Korean government has approached the cryptocurrency industry with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday’s ruling and the outlook of a formal framework for token sales, however, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201709082148015&code=940301", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/south-koreas-ico-ban-reaction-serious-concerns-over-cryptocurrency-investment-practices/", "http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20180130001005"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ahn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme cou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suwon district court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T00:19:56.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ad9502174679b5c9e94bc9d9669da772fe1e34f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSUkMmB8wU0C4mM9HOuEOvksBy_XOl5HwKcCx6nfZKaXHQORn7CGVsOO4SIY1NuGNPGSNV2c2pOWP", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Magic Number?

Slovenia has announced that its largest shopping center — coincidentally known as BTC City — will transform into a complete bitcoin city, in which every store and venture will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology.The complex, located in the country’s capital of Ljubljana, stretches over 1,558,398 square feet and contains over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently visited the shopping center, where he was treated to a cup of coffee (purchased with cryptocurrency by State Secretary Tadej Slapnik). Details regarding the center’s newfound approach to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma.\n“The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City,” said BTC City representatives.\nBTC City initially began in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics center. More warehouses were added to the complex over time, and, by 1990, it had transformed into a commercial shopping arena. BTC City presently plays host to several travel and tourism ventures including a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park — home to Slovenia’s tallest building.\nExecutives of BTC City say they’re hoping Bitcoin City will give rise to new businesses that push the cryptocurrency space toward mainstream territory and lead to further blockchain developments.\n“Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs and operating policies,” they said.\nEligma’s cryptocurrency transaction system Elipay is being installed in several stores. Situated throughout the premises are also several one-way cryptocurrency ATMs, along with the Blockchain Think Tank and what executives call the biggest crypto mining rig in Slovenia.\nRepresentatives further commented, “The development of BTC City into a bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine. 👓 View full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.onenewspage.com/n/Markets/1zj8fylhh3/Slovenia-Plays-Host-to-the-World-First.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tadej slapnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miro cerar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc city", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slovenia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ljubljana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T23:32:48.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6862afffe3a75b4376529defd021d62ab3f633ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5Cq63VugO2L2g-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "title_full": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "published": "2018-06-05T17:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6862afffe3a75b4376529defd021d62ab3f633ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5Cq63VugO2L2g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "chard lie", "published": "2018-06-05T17:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "text": "Bitcoin for me is number one because it's the only exchange with fiat.

The businessman was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme. The ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals. The central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies. The government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.

The mining capacity is 24 TH/s and the price of the machines will be adjusted monthly according to demand. Using GMO’s mining rigs, the power consumption can be reduced up to 20% and the cost of network equipment can be reduced to 1/55, local media report from Tuesday’s press conference.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Miner B2 Specs\nJapanese internet giant GMO announced the details of its bitcoin mining rigs called “GMO miner B2” in a press conference on Tuesday, June 5, ahead of the actual launch that is scheduled for the morning of the following day, June 6.\nNikkei reported:\nThe GMO miner B2 features a semiconductor chip ‘GMO 72b’ dedicated to mining that adopts the in-house developed 7-nanometer process technology. The hash rate indicating the computing capacity of mining is 24 TH/s, and can calculate hash 24 trillion times per second. Bitmain Antminer S9\nFor comparison, the popular Bitmain Antminer S9’s hashrate is 14TH/s. According to Bloomberg, the GMO chips are designed in Japan and produced in Taiwan.\nMasatoshi Kumagai, Chairman and Director of GMO Internet and the GMO Group representative, described the advantages of his company’s mining equipment over other products.\n“The performance per unit is higher than that of major competitors’ products,” he was quoted by the news outlet. “If we switch from over 20,000 mining machines operating in Northern Europe to GMO miner B2, the installation space will be about half in terms of equivalent performance.” Power Consumption\n“Compared to general mining machines…the power consumption is up to 20%, the cost of network equipment etc. can be reduced to 1/55,” Itmedia noted.\nKumai publication reported from the press conference that each unit consumes 1,950 watts and power supply units can supply up to 2,200 watts at 240 V. Adjustable Price – $1,999 for June\nGMO miner B2 will be sold through the company’s subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland, according to Nikkei. They will be on sale starting Wednesday and orders will start shipping from the end of October, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nThe price for each unit is “announced monthly,” the publication added, revealing that the “sales price in June is $1,999.” Itmedia described:\nThe price for the June release is $1,999 (including power supply unit, excluding tax). The sales price is adjusted monthly according to demand etc. The number of shipments was kept private.\nCurrently, Bitmain’s Antminer S9 is priced at $837. GMO’s Plans\nMr. Masatoshi Kumagai told reporters that so far the crypto mining industry is dominated “by mining machines provided by Bitmain, a major mining hardware company in China,” and that he “noticed the fact that not a single Japanese company that is good at manufacturing is able to participate.”\nHe also revealed that the company “invested nearly 10 billion yen for the development of the product,” the publication conveyed and quoted the chairman explaining:\nWe are not setting business targets such as sales targets yet, but if we cannot sell it, we will use it in our mining business, so I think that it is a very excellent business in that there is no inventory risk.\nFurthermore, he added, “we also provide an API (application programming interface) for system monitoring compatible with GMO miner B2 and a detection function [for] when the product is connected to the net at the time of an unlikely event of theft.”\nWhat do you think of GMO miner B2? Will you buy one? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, Nikkei, Itmedia, Kumai, and GMO Internet.\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

Hedge fund mogul Jim Chanos claimed Bitcoin was “masquerading as a technological breakthrough” in a new interview with Bloomberg June 4. Chanos said that in the event of a global crisis, it would be “better” to own food, or a government-backed ( fiat ) currency. Speaking to the Institute for New Economic Thinking and quoted by various media outlets, Chanos, who last year stated he “didn’t understand” Bitcoin or blockchain technology, issued stark warnings about cryptocurrency investment. “We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he told Bloomberg. He also called the past year’s increased public interest in Bitcoin part of the “fraud cycle,” adding: “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.” Chanos added that in the event of a global crisis, governments would step in with fiat currency as lenders of last resort, an option unavailable to cryptocurrency, given its decentralized nature: “For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.” The well known short-seller, who predicted the fall of Enron, joins an ever-decreasing pool of steadfast Bitcoin naysayers. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who in December 2017 told Bloomberg Bitcoin “isn’t for him,” has since presided over a policy of increasing exposure to crypto assets.\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet and vice president Charlie Munger nonetheless remain committed to denouncing Bitcoin investment in increasingly grotesque language , with Munger most recently comparing crypto trading to dealing in “freshly harvested baby brains” last month. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/goldman-sachs", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fiat-money", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/warren-buffett-charlie-munger-slam-bitcoin-again-resort-to-elementary-school-insults", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/chanos-calls-bitcoin-last-thing-i-d-want-to-own-in-a-crisis", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/blankfein-says-too-soon-for-bitcoin-strategy-as-volatility-jumps", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-adoption-by-businesses-in-2017", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldman-sachs-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-fraud-plans-trading", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/munger-scales-new-metaphorical-heights-with-bitcoin-bashing-compares-crypto-to-organ-trading", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-09-28/chanos-says-cryptocurrencies-seem-a-little-frothy-video"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "enron prophet chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:54:14.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62cc8b5c5d3f344415f8b2248c7ee3147e7bf679", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1Ya3jfZQYGiDiIRqA8XOzZfDIZt5y9aG2IWjYXtexlOl01QUOehXFv3nWMDZxe2ppw-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6517", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "MarketWatch", "title": "Why is bitcoin volatility tumbling?", "title_full": "Why is bitcoin volatility tumbling?", "published": "2018-06-05T17:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62cc8b5c5d3f344415f8b2248c7ee3147e7bf679", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1Ya3jfZQYGiDiIRqA8XOzZfDIZt5y9aG2IWjYXtexlOl01QUOehXFv3nWMDZxe2ppw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T17:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why is bitcoin volatility tumbling?", "text": "June 05, 2018 at 10:39 AM EDT Why is bitcoin volatility tumbling?

Bitcoin touched an intraday high of $7,599.74 and would later settle around $7,570. Bitcoin fell below a major support level on Monday, potentially setting the stage for a bigger short-term reversal.\nAll major coins within the top-25 reported growth. Privacy coin Monero was among the best performers, rising 5.4% to $167. Binance Coin and Ontology each rose more than 6%.\nAmong the majors, Ethereum climbed 3.1% to $606. Ripple XRP gained 3.7% to $0.675. Bitcoin cash (BCH), the world’s No. 4 digital currency, added 3% to $1,135 (all figures according to CoinMarketCap).\nAt the time of writing, the combined value of crypto assets was $343 billion. Trading volumes are down roughly $1 billion compared with 24 hours ago. Daily market turnover amounted to just $15.8 billion. Trading volumes are down more than 38% over the past month.\nMoney 20/20 Conference\nThe rally comes on day two of Money20/20 Europe, a leading fintech conference that recently shined the spotlight on digital currency.\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak praised bitcoin and other digital currencies at the three-day event but warned investors not to get carried away with prices. In an interview with CNBC, Wozniak said he believes bitcoin will become the single global currency, though later clarified that the outlook is based more on his desire to see a “pure” cryptocurrency gain mass adoption.\nHowever, digital currencies still have a long way to go before they can compete with more established payment processors. After evaluating five payment platforms, the conference organizers found cryptocurrency to be the fourth fastest. The Money20/20 Europe Payments Race pitted Team Cash, Team Card, Team Wearables, Team Crypto and Team Mobile against each other to find out the fastest payment route between Istanbul and Amsterdam. Crypto was outpaced by every team except Mobile.\nTransaction speeds vary greatly across cryptocurrency, with Ripple XRP requiring as little as four seconds to process transactions. By comparison, bitcoin requires 42 minutes for confirmation, based on latest data provided by Blockchain.info.\nThe European leg of Money20/20 will run until Wednesday. The conference will make stops in the United States and China in October and November, respectively.\nCrypto prices are usually highly receptive to industry conferences. That all changed last month after Consensus 2018 – arguably the biggest crypto summit on the planet – failed to spur a rally in market prices. In fact, cryptocurrencies declined sharply following the event.\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

Communication from the agency is awaited to confirm the other details.\nThe scam masterminded by Amit and Vivek Bhardwaj, referred to as Bhardwaj brothers, involves duping investors in Multi-Level-Marketing and bitcoin related schemes​ to the tune of over Rs 2000 crore. The Bhardwaj brothers were nabbed in April after multiple failed arrests.\nAlso Read: Raj Kundra: From bus-conductor's son to the 198th-richest British Asian\nKundra's wife, Shilpa Shetty had apparently tweeted in 2017 about adding a book to her reading list. Interestingly the actress had tagged Amit Bhardwaj the mastermind behind the Gain Bitcoin fraud. Adding “Crypto Currency for Beginners” to my reading list! Thanks @amitbitcoin for enlightening me on Bitcoin investing #amitbhardwaj\nThe Gain Bitcoin Scam:\nNearly 8000 people have been reportedly cheated by various dubious investment plans from companies headed by the Bhardwaj brothers. The total size of the scam is estimated to run over Rs 2000 crores.\nVivek and Amit hailing from Shalimar Bagh area in Delhi were the founders of companies​ - Gain Bitcoin, GB Miners, and GB21. These companies were fronts for bitcoin mining, trading and multi-level marketing​, cops say​ .\nInvestors were lured in​to investing in Gain Bitcoin through several multi-level marketing concepts. At one time Amit, who has been alleged to be the mastermind​, also launched his own cryptocurrency flavour called MCAP.\nApparently ​​ Amit Bhardwaj​​ , the younger among the brothers was an ex-Inf​osys​ associate. Multiple sources claimed that their father was working with the Finance ministry, and that inspired Amit ​to have a keen interest in economics.\nAs the heat from investors surged, the Bhardwaj brothers left the country. An Enforcement Directorate lookout notice helped ​find them​ - first in Dubai then in Thailand.\nThe duo would have been nabbed in Dubai had it not been for Amit reportedly faking a heart attack. The heart attack helped the Bhardwaj brothers time their escape to Thailand. ​\nBy April, the major arrests in the Bhardwaj case were that of Pankaj Adalakha, a motivational speaker and Akash Sancheti, a software firm operator. The investigation authorities had recovered 32 bitcoins, nearly 80 Ethers, and Rs 38.96 lakh in cash.

With prices for cryptocurrencies broadly lower this year, investors are not, at least according to one metric, not researching the asset class as much as they once did.\nData indicates Google searches of bitcoin and related terms are falling alongside prices of digital assets.\n“Searches for the term “bitcoin” have dropped more than 75 percent since the beginning of this year and roughly halved over three months, according to research from Google Trends,” reports CNBC .\nBitcoin does not lack for supporters as there have been plenty of bullish calls on the cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Some crypto market observers have opined bitcoin could reach new highs this year, but those are just projections. In financial markets, price matters and bitcoin’s price has rapidly eroded since the start of May. Inside The Google Trends Data on Bitcoin Popularity\n“Google Trends uses numbers to represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. As of January 1, bitcoin’s popularity was 37 and fell to a 9 as of June 2,” according to CNBC.\nThe all-time high for bitcoin is around $20,000, which was seen in December 2017. In recent weeks, there have been plenty of calls for the cryptocurrency to return to those record highs and beyond. Still, bitcoin has some technical issues to deal with. A move below $7,000 could send bitcoin to $5,000. Bitcoin traded just under $7,500 on Monday.

I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,\" he said.\nChanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. Huge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $800 billion in value in December.\nBitcoin's original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing. They also argued that its independence made it a more viable long-term currency.\nChanos said: \"For those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\"\nThe interviewer then suggested bitcoin is a \"libertarian fantasy,\" to which Chanos replied: \"That’s exactly what it is. And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\"\nHe added: \"Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\n\"This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. Someone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a 'monetary Somalia'.\"\nYou can read the full interview here.\nNOW WATCH: How socially

own is bitcoin if the grid goes down' Oscar Williams-Grut Jun 5, 2018, 02.57 PM Read full story Reuters Jim Chanos. Short seller Jim Chanos says bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a product of the long-running bull market, which is pushing investors to take more risk and \"believe things.\" Chanos agreed that bitcoin is a \"libertarian fantasy\" and said its main utility is avoiding tax. \"This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.\"\nLONDON - Renowned short seller Jim Chanos thinks cryptocurrencies are a product of the run-away global bull market and have little use beyond avoiding tax.\nChanos, known for predicting the collapse of Enron, addressed the topic of cryptocurrencies in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Chanos, who runs New York-based Kynikos Associates, said investors are getting \"a little bit jiggy with their capital\" and are more \"willing to take risks, willing to believe things\" the longer the current bull market goes on.\n\"So today we've got bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], which went ballistic in 2017,\" Chanos said. \"I suspect going forward we're going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging.\"\n\"We're now nine years into this bull market, same as the '90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,\" he said.\nChanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. Huge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $800 billion in value in December.\nBitcoin's original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing. They also argued that its independence made it a more viable long-term currency.\nChanos said: \"For those who believe it's a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you're going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it - for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\" The interviewer then suggested bitcoin is a \"libertarian fantasy,\" to which Chanos replied: \"That's exactly what it is. And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\"\nHe added: \"Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That's one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\n\"This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. Someone at Grant's interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a 'monetary Somalia'.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/jim-chanos-cryptocurrency-is-a-security-speculation-game-masquerading-as-a-technological-breakthrough"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters short", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kynikos associates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:24:48.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8576f386fb6ff811144b26f28e257d0cdb7b306", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8cQgXyr0ezSUUC697A3mayhzvd_AVv_7.27RatA82iPxOkFl8UD6bsXC5oXWPHk9uwOnbVvXcMnTlS1DUSMWhC1ldZV44hCSA8vnjQz_vhySKsmzdHHUvu3bcA_js7N7TcR8oVsq_IR9wED.lWb4vrWNG0r9qi6vZrUgb8mNpb9pFI59KfKfwJDtqMM_ND.5LnPNlnFf17pTfXjBVVHRCn", "site_full": "www.india.com", "site": "india.com", "site_section": "http://www.india.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest India News | LIVE Breaking News Headlines | Current Affairs, Sports, Bollywood, Politics, Business, Technology, Results & Employment News | India.com", "title": "Sunny Leone, Shilpa Shetty, Zareen Khan, Prachi Desai, Karishma Tanna, Other Bollywood Actresses’ Names Crop up in Bitcoin Scam", "title_full": "Sunny Leone, Shilpa Shetty, Zareen Khan, Prachi Desai, Karishma Tanna, Other Bollywood Actresses’ Names Crop up in Bitcoin Scam", "published": "2018-06-05T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bollywood-actress.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 583, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8576f386fb6ff811144b26f28e257d0cdb7b306", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8cQgXyr0ezSUUC697A3mayhzvd_AVv_7.27RatA82iPxOkFl8UD6bsXC5oXWPHk9uwOnbVvXcMnTlS1DUSMWhC1ldZV44hCSA8vnjQz_vhySKsmzdHHUvu3bcA_js7N7TcR8oVsq_IR9wED.lWb4vrWNG0r9qi6vZrUgb8mNpb9pFI59KfKfwJDtqMM_ND.5LnPNlnFf17pTfXjBVVHRCn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "India.com News Desk", "published": "2018-06-05T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sunny Leone, Shilpa Shetty, Zareen Khan, Prachi Desai, Karishma Tanna, Other Bollywood Actresses’ Names Crop up in Bitcoin Scam", "text": "Real life passionate kisses of Bollywood celebs Mumbai, Jun 5: Bollywood actress Sunny Leone, Zareen Khan, Prachi Desai, Karishma Tanna, Huma Qureshi, Shilpa Shetty Kundra and others’ names cropped up during questioning of businessman Raj Kundra by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday in connection with a money-laundering probe related to a bitcoin transactions scam. The ED will summon these Bollywood stars soon. Raj Kundra was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating, ED officials said. Kundra’s name turned up in the report following alleged links with Bitcoin scamster Amit Bhardwaj. According to media reports, Bhardwaj had started the country’s first online marketplace which accepted bitcoins and had also started bitcoin mining start-ups. He reportedly lured in investors with promises of hefty returns, assuring the investors of access to the bitcoin mining system that would let them mine their own bitcoins. Kundra had allegedly promoted one of Bhardwaj’s operations. During the questioning, it was revealed that Shilpa Shetty, Huma Qureshi and Nargis Fakhri promoted Bharadwaj’s company in Dubai and Singapore. Sunny Leone, Zareen Khan, Prachi Desai, Karishma Tanna and some other actresses met people running Bitcoin in Dubai and invited people to invest in it.

For the sake of clarity, I will say that I do not promote a particular currency. Personally, I moved to Alta until then, until the showdown with bitcoins. Most of the money poured into BTH comes from Korea. And it is necessary to think about it. This means that most of them do not sell their BTC to convert them to BCH.\nI think mainly the drop in BTC is because played in the gambling on BTC with margin accounts cash funds for the repayment of borrowed funds. The sale of BTC is also due to the fact that many were aimed at making quick profits, and BTC gave a lot of such opportunities. The hard fork of BTC, BCH buyers and their manipulations designed to win over BTC, all together caused great uncertainty. On this we will finish the reasoning and move on to the facts:\nBitcoin Cash offers a block size of 8 MB, and bitcoin has a block size of 1 MB. BCH increases transaction speed and reduces fees. This is a really big advantage.\nBitcoin Cash offers protection against re-write-off and protects investors from losing coins during forks.\nBitcoin is an original brand.\nBitcoin has a very large, loyal community. Most bitcoin maximalists will stay with the original and support its upgrade for scalability.\nI'm closely watching what happens with hardforum Segwit2x Bitcoin and Cash.

There have been reports suggesting that Google did this with the intention of keeping people from being exposed to potentially dangerous risks involving ICOs and other points relating to advertisements. This came amid Facebook also announcing it would outlaw such advertisements from being visible. Even more importantly, this comes as the two groups might be interested in doing something more within the currency industry.\nCryptocurrency experts have been coming forward and are arguing that the current ban on cryptocurrency advertising is unethical and inappropriate. Blackmore Group CEO Phillip Nunn has been among the loudest voices expressing concern.\nNunn stated in an interview with The Independent that he feels Google and Facebook are trying to regulate what their readers want to see. He argues that even though cryptocurrency ads cannot be seen anywhere on Facebook or Google, people can still use those sites to view ads for gambling and adult-oriented services. This leads to what he feels is a double standard over how ads are produced.\nHe did understand in the interview that much of what Google and Facebook are doing entails trying to keep criminal actions relating to currencies from taking place. However, he also argues that the move by the two groups is overreaching and makes it harder for actual currencies to be highlighted and made available to other people. This includes currencies from genuine service providers.\nA New Currency?\nPhillip Nunn also stated that he feels one of those groups that have outlawed currency ads might be trying to produce one’s own currency in the future. By outlawing advertisements for currencies, Facebook or Google could have the market to themselves by allowing themselves to promote their own currency instead of what others are offering. This statement from Nunn is only speculation at the moment.\nThe two online services have still expressed some kind of interest in offering a currency. They have been interested in what the blockchain field has to offer in terms of how it produces currencies and what makes it valuable for transactions in many forms.\nGoogle contacted the group behind the Ethereum currency not long ago to talk about trying to get services from that group. This has led some to believe that there might be an attempt to make a currency based off of the Ethereum blockchain . People with Google have stated online that they were simply looking into how the blockchain technology works. No one would say anything about whether they were interested in getting the blockchain system to work in some fashion.\nOther Voices\nNunn is not the only major figure who has expressed issues over the advertising ban. Digital banking group Revolut head Ed Cooper said to The Independent that the bans on advertising make up a dramatic shift in how currencies are highlighted. More importantly, he feels that legitimate businesses in the field who have genuine services available would be harmed by the ban, thus making it harder for them to offer the currency services that they wish to share.\nPlease enter your name here You have entered an incorrect email address!

In a recent poll on cryptocurrency’s popularity reported by The Korea Times, statistics showed that 21.6% of the 2,511 participants were aware of cryptocurrencies with 29.4% and 40.3% among respondents in their 20s and 30s, respectively, but only 5.7% of those in their 60s and a tiny 2.2% of those in their 70s were actually aware of cryptocurrency.\nAnother study by Swiss fintech company Creologix concluded that most millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996, are not saving for retirement , but increasingly buying cryptocurrencies for their future financial security.\nIn Japan, the situation is bucking the global trend. Recently, Japan’s Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA) recorded that out of the 2,769 domestic inquiries it received on cryptocurrencies in 2017, most of the inquiries were from the 40s to 50s age group, although there was only a slightly lower percentage in other age groups. Some calls were even from parents with concerns for their teenage children using cryptocurrency.\nThe increasing interest in the space by seniors reflects these figures, and the new mature students are not simply concerned with their children’s or even their grandchildren’s welfare. There appears to be a growing interest amongst the age group to develop their knowledge for more practical purposes.\nThe new center’s website suggests that it “supports dissemination of the correct information and knowledge of virtual currencies”, adding that it has connections with overseas exchanges; its aim to promote “the sound development of the virtual currency industry”. It appears for this age group, investment of stocks is slowly being overtaken by cryptocurrency investment as a means to securing retirement. The center explains:\n“…since 2017 virtual currencies became a topic in the news, and seniors who start investing [in] virtual currencies are increasing… we hold virtual currency seminars… and some participants in their 80s have participated.”\nIt added that the elderly are turning to cryptocurrency “for the future relief of family and grandchildren to eliminate anxiety about old age”.\nThe course teaches its students how to open an account at a crypto exchange, how to buy crypto with yen and how to store their assets in wallets and cold storage. They also learn how to make analysis using Twitter including “promising altcoin watching methods”, plus the tricks associated with diversifying their portfolios. Details regarding taxation round off their newly acquired skills.\nAsia is the world’s cryptocurrency hub and as a result, learning centers, courses, and crypto educational establishments are on the rise, with Japan, Thailand and South Korea showing the way, reports Bitcoin.com. It may not be surprising to find such centers in Japan, but they are increasing in number. In November of last year, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam accounted for 80% of global Bitcoin trading.\nThe post Forget Millennials, Tokyo Seniors’ Center Proves Age No Barrier to Bitcoin appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Chanos, known for predicting the collapse of Enron, addressed the topic of cryptocurrencies in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking.\nChanos, who runs New York-based Kynikos Associates, said investors are getting “a little bit jiggy with their capital” and are more “willing to take risks, willing to believe things” the longer the current bull market goes on. “So today we’ve got bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], which went ballistic in 2017,” Chanos said.\n“I suspect going forward we’re going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging.”“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate.\nI think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,” he said. Chanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally.\nHuge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $800 billion in value in December. Bitcoin’s original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing.

It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes. It includes six coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, and OKB) and requires USDT to subscribe.

Today the team behind the wallet issued a response to the event, further explaining what happened and detailing the steps taken to prevent its reoccurrence.\nThey say that the attack was carried out by a native Russian speaker, which was able to phish only about $150,000 worth of ether from MEW users. They quote Internet Security experts as explaining that the “financial resources required for such an attack likely exceeds the amount of funds taken.”\nThe team added that it is a lack of safety education that led some clients to fall for the fraud. “We hope that from this experience, every single person who interacts with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will understand how important self-education is. In the end, you and only you are responsible for your security.”\nJOIN THE DISCUSSION ON BITCOIN.COM Latest News From Yesterday\nRussian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money Mikhail Shlyapnikov, cancer survivor turned quaint Russian farmer and cryptocurrency revolutionary, is well known within the ecosystem.

This is very pure and there is no human behind it, no company runs it, it just keeps growing, growing and trying to survive,\" he added.

Bitcoin's market capitalization has almost reached US $ 127 billion, while Ethereum is at US $ 58 billion.

At that time, Dorsey believed that Bitcoin would be the single currency in the world, and Wozniak also wanted it to happen.\n\"I agree with what Jack Dorsey said without needing to hope it will happen, but because I want it to be true it is a very pure thought,\" he said.\n\"Bitcoin can be mathematically defined, there is a definite quantity, there is a way in which it is distributed. This is very pure and there is no human behind it, no company runs it, it just keeps growing, growing and trying to survive,\" he added. Wozniak himself bought the most popular cryptocurrency when the price is still equivalent to US $ 700 per chip, or US $ 6,700 cheaper when compared to its value now referring to data from Coindesk. Even so, Wozniak is not interested in becoming a Bitcoin investor.\nHe also has sold all of his Bitcoin assets with only one chip left. The man who is often referred to as The Woz said he only wanted to do experiments on the technology.\nIn addition to having a piece of Bitcoin, the man who founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 also has two Ethereum. Wozniak's second cryptocurrency is the owner of the largest market capitalization among other digital currencies. Bitcoin's market capitalization has almost reached US $ 127 billion, while Ethereum is at US $ 58 billion. In addition to these two virtual currencies, there are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies circulating in the world. Even so, Wozniak says Bitcoin is the only natural because it has aspects that make it a status, one of which has been decentralized.\n\"The only Bitcoin is a natural digital gold and I am absolutely convinced of it, others tend to give up in providing aspects of Bitcoin, for example, being completely decentralized without any control center,\" he said. \"It's one thing that no one else has, in having a business model, its nature is more important than sharing the conventional aspects that humans have,\" Wozniak concluded.

Because of that article, I’m now inundated with all manner of questions about what hot cryptocurrency to pick, the best ICO, and how to make money with cryptocurrency, and a bunch of ‘how do I get rich from cryptocurrency’ type questions. In an attempt to deflect the hoard of questions and provide some basic answer to some of the new visitors, I’ve spent the past few days writing a brand new guide to answer all the questions I’m getting. Welcome to The Mega Ultimate Guide to Making Millions with Cryptocurrency ICO’s. This is the very first article I have written myself for my new site CryptoIncome.io at http://cryptoincome.io/ There’s a number of articles on this site, all aimed at new investors and beginners to the cryptocurrency market. However, those were written by my staff, but not me. I figure I myself need to step in here and write a few core articles for you guys to get this site going and provide real value to the public from someone who knows what they are doing in this space. So if you are interested in my own articles here, make sure to check out all articles by Ben Krypto at http://cryptoincome.io/author/benk/.\nIf you have questions and want to discuss no bullshit, no shill cryptocurrency picks with other passionate investors, join the Crypto Income Telegram group at https://t.me/joinchat/GbWHDA-N03C_vyQ9hdscQQ. I like to think this is by far the most comprehensive guide on the topic of making filthy amounts of money with ICO’s. And yes, I can confirm it is indeed possible to make ludicrous money through ICO investing. Why? Because I’ve made millions with ICO’s. So I can confirm it is indeed possible. And I’m going to make millions more. Now, I don’t want to bog this whole article down by showing proof. But if you feel you need to see I’m not bullshitting on my claims, simply check out the article I wrote on AuthorityIncome 6 months ago at http://authorityincome.com/how-i-made-a-million-dollars-with-cryptocurrency/ where I wrote about how I made over a million dollars in just 3 weeks. And yes, I go to great length to show you proof that I’m not bullshitting. Since then it’s been 6 months and the market has gone up 10x and a lot of craziness has happened. So this article is written by someone who’s not just talking the talk but walking the walk. This everything I reasonably know about how to make money with ICO’s. My ICO handbook, as it were. And I’m going to only charge you the fair price of $4,999 to become rich. ….actually not, I’m giving it away to you for FREE. Because that’s what I like to do and because I’ve made so much money in crypto that I don’t need any of yours. So why would I do this when I can clearly take your money?\nBecause I can, that’s why. And I hate all the stupid you tube shills and self-made fakers out there trying to tell you guys what shitcoins to buy, right before they’ve loaded up on their coins to dump on their followers. Anyways, enough of that. Let’s talk how to make some money. To make money in the current crypto market, you just need to know one word. It’s called ‘ICO’ (Initial Coin Offering). Remember those words, because right now, that’s going to be your best friend. Mr ICO has been my very generous friend the past 7 months and has been gifting me with millions. And he can be your friend too. THE ICO GAME. ICO’s stand for ‘Initial Coin Offering‘ which is sort of like the cryptocurrency version of an IPO, minus the regulations (for now). ICOs are, at least in current market conditions, are the best way to make money with cryptocurrencies, hands down, feet first. I can’t say if the ICO gold rush will last for more than a few months and span the entire 2018 and beyond, but at least right now the market is red hot for ICO’s. I expect this to change within the next 3 to 6 months, so this guide may not be so relevant when those changes occur, either due to market sentiment, a market correction, or the implementation of regulations ICO across the world. So how can you make ridiculous amounts of money with cryptocurrency? Two ways. 1. Buy strong coins and hold them for months / years or, 2. ICO’s. My strategy has been the #2 option. Why the ICO? Simple.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network https://mypr.co.za/getting-started-with-cryptocurrency-part-6/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cryptoincome.io/author/benk/.", "https://t.me/joinchat/GbWHDA-N03C_vyQ9hdscQQ.", "http://authorityincome.com/", "http://authorityincome.com/how-i-made-a-million-dollars-with-cryptocurrency/", "http://cryptoincome.io/", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben krypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:28:04.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e3add8fe639d13ab915659f0ae0200865a5f5cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ1rz7pcJtBh5EDJFgEjgM5NauLcgK2h_EMrgLoTM21W0v9ibh2HqhqnhegTPPb0U3odSsB2U.RaC_KSfDGCAKat44.PO.ZynM-", "site_full": "myownmarketnarrative.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://myownmarketnarrative.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "My Own Market Narrative", "title": "Jim Chanos on Bitcoin", "title_full": "Jim Chanos on Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T16:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e3add8fe639d13ab915659f0ae0200865a5f5cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ1rz7pcJtBh5EDJFgEjgM5NauLcgK2h_EMrgLoTM21W0v9ibh2HqhqnhegTPPb0U3odSsB2U.RaC_KSfDGCAKat44.PO.ZynM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "I Will Never Accept The Terms of Service (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T16:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jim Chanos on Bitcoin", "text": " Tuesday, June 5, 2018 Jim Chanos on Bitcoin INET - Chanos says bitcoin is a security speculation game . Great quotes from him. The introductory quote says it all: I’ve found in my research and my teaching that what I would call the “fraud cycle”— instances of large-scale financial fraud over multiple platforms and companies in the financial markets in the modern era (the last 500 years) — follows the financial cycle with a lag. That means that as business and particularly financial markets improve, peoples’ sense of disbelief and caution that they’ve often earned from the previous downturn begins to erode. Schemes that before might have seemed too good to be true begin to be embraced. And as for the utility of bitcoin: Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out. Last year, just as the mania was really going, an early convert who had gotten in early and had made a lot of money wrote this humorous blog about trying to cash in his winnings, if you will. He chronicled telling the exchange that he wanted to convert his bitcoins into U.S. dollars and have them wired into his U.S. bank. It took something like eight or ten days and numerous follow-ups and phone calls. The funniest part was his having to fax his passport to Lithuania. [...] Using a fax machine to Eastern Europe struck me as kind of the antithesis of what you’re trying to do here. So this is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. Someone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a “monetary Somalia.” And an interesting aside comparing the Bushes to the Clintons, which the Democrats should fucking pay attention to when discussing why the working class has abandoned them: I always joke that the two presidents who have put more executives in jail than all the rest combined were both named Bush. W’s father was instrumental in prosecuting the S&L [Saving and Loan] crooks back in the early ‘90s and put about 3,000 of them in jail. I think they realized that the public was losing money in the stock markets, not just because of the frauds, but because the long dot-com bull market had ended. People were upset. Then when you had the revelations of WorldCom and Enron on top of it, there was a sense that every corporation was crooked and this was going to have exogenous impacts on the economy and the market as a whole. I think they correctly realized that we’ve got to basically show that we’re the cops on the beat. And they did. Whereas after 2008 under the Democrats: People in New York and San Francisco and Boston might be fine with everything, but in the South and Midwest, where you’re from and where I’m from, there’s still this general sense that “the bastards got away with it and I’m still suffering.” So there is an exogenous cost to this where people don’t feel that there was justice. They feel that they were taken advantage of by those sharpies on the coasts. at", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "inet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:57:01.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f031474e2ed1953056fc23e49fbdfaba95cfee6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSqWCrnt1drQsiuslnv_0710X4D2vx5AJPQLz7nN0wp7IIWjejYle0zp0TCtK9SFWlE-", "site_full": "thenewsunit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thenewsunit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The News UNIT", "title": "Bitcoin Ben reveals he's a member of ANONYMOUS", "title_full": "Bitcoin Ben reveals he's a member of ANONYMOUS", "published": "2018-06-05T16:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f031474e2ed1953056fc23e49fbdfaba95cfee6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSqWCrnt1drQsiuslnv_0710X4D2vx5AJPQLz7nN0wp7IIWjejYle0zp0TCtK9SFWlE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The News UNIT (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T16:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Ben reveals he's a member of ANONYMOUS", "text": "Bit CON MAN Ben\nWow Bitcoin Ben!\nWe didn't realize you were that important:\nHe's in ANONYMOUS:\nThis man Bitcoin Ben is revealing now that he's in ANONYMOUS.

Here’s what you need to know before you commit. 1] What is Bitcoin?\nStop! If you don’t know what Bitcoin is yet, don’t introduce it into your business just for the sake of it! This is not just another payment method.\nWhile the available technology is making it easier and easier to set up your business to receive Bitcoin payments, there is still some technical skill and know-how that will make things far easier.\nIf you need help with Bitcoin basics , check out online guides, like these crypto guides for Australians , to help you get a grip on things. 2] Advertise it\nWhile the number of Bitcoin users is constantly on the rise, it is still a niche technology. If you don’t advertise that you are accepting Bitcoin, you aren’t going to be generating much revenue this way.\nPutting a sign up in your window will be enough, you don’t need to go overboard here. There are a variety of different logos and sign designs online that you are free to use.\nIf you are able to print a decal to put in your window, this will be more attention-grabbing and, therefore, a more effective advertisement.\nSimilarly, before you invest too heavily in Bitcoin payment infrastructure, you could take a straw poll of your customers over a day or two. This will give you a good indication of how much interest there is for you to make such a move. 3] Accepting Payments\nThere are a variety of ways that you can accept Bitcoin payments, both online and offline. The number of payment methods available is one of Bitcoin’s greatest strengths, from the perspective of consumers and businesses.\nFor a brick and mortar store, you can use a variety of smartphone apps which have been developed specifically for this purpose. These apps automate the process of transferring Bitcoin from one wallet to another.\nThe merchant connects their wallet address and the app, deposits the equivalent amount in fiat currency, and a QR code is generated.\nThe customer then scans this QR code with their own Bitcoin mobile app and the payment is transferred automatically. 4] Hardware Terminals\nYou have two options as far as Bitcoin-capable payment terminals go. The best option for you will depend mostly on your own technical knowledge.\nFirst, you can buy a specialized payment terminal with Bitcoin payments integrated into it. The alternative is to manually add the appropriate software to an existing, compatible, payment terminal. For most businesses, it will be simpler to buy the appropriate terminal.\nMany of these Bitcoin-capable terminals will also process payments using traditional, fiat currencies .\nAccepting Bitcoin payments in brick and mortar stores has been a significant milestone for the technology’s maturation. Be a part of the future and accept Bitcoin payments at your business.

So I tried to convince my organization (the Austrian part of SOS-childrensvillages) to offer bitcoin and alt coins as a form of donating.\nAs you can imagine I got a lot of concerning questions but I managed to clear all hurdles and also got a lot people in my org to think positive about the crypto world. Well a couple of weeks later and now we offer anonymous donations with BTC, ETH and XRP for children in need. That means you won’t get e-mails, letters or calls from us. That also helps us saving money and resources.\nAt the moment I'm trying to find it-projects within sos-childrensvillages to support children and young people with IT-courses, hardware etc. I think that would be a great connection and probably more people would be interested in donating BTC directly into those projects.\nWhy does a non-profit organization accept Bitcoin? Isn’t that extremely volatile and speculative?\nWe are exchanging all donated coins weekly back into € (as soon a sum of € 50 is reached) and thanks to a cooperation with Bitpanda we are able to do this without any fees or charges. That means the donation reaches children in need with its full amount like all normal donations with fiat money.\nIf you have any feedback, critique, wish-list for new coins or if you want to just have a look at our site:\nwww.donate-crypto.eu - That is our URL and I am very happy to answer all questions in this thread.\nOf course we are very happy about every little donation but even mouth2mouth, a twitter share or Facebook post or a share in a telegram group could help us a lot. Thanks in advance for having a look at this.\nGreets, Florian\nwww.donate-crypto.eu\nwww.sos-kinderdorf.at\n[florian.seeberger@sos-kinderdorf.at](mailto: florian.seeberger@sos-kinderdorf.at )\n submitted by /u/tiltberger\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.donate-crypto.eu/", "http://www.sos-kinderdorf.at/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:48:16.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ebca726ae05acabb003f7c1888bc4860be96b59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocxJAWu8iIN.I-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-05T16:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ebca726ae05acabb003f7c1888bc4860be96b59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocxJAWu8iIN.I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HukoJla", "published": "2018-06-05T16:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "You should not think that bitcoin has nowhere else to develop.

I think those illegal transaction are one of the reasons some governments and the media are trying to depreciate bitcoin, but the problem is not Crypto/blockchain or Bitcoin, is just the society.\nWell said. I will also state that the bitcoin and most likely the internet, are innocent entities and only us, humans can abuse it and use it for bad purposes.

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn’t fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‘Index’ Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms Bitcoin Cash Is May’s King of Coins\nThere are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that’s in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May – 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar’s weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however – ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded. Fake Volume Rears Its Head\nWhen it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it’s likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it’s likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who’s responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

This should come as no surprise. After all, Paypal is one of the Internet’s largest online payment processors while Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency. The two should be a match made in heaven, right?\nActually, selling bitcoin may violate Paypal’s terms and services. For one, Paypal prohibits activity that “(h) involves currency exchanges or check cashing businesses.” While the debate over whether bitcoin is a digital asset or currencies continues to rise, the above prohibition adds complications for bitcoin traders.\nSecond, scammers have been using a quirk in Paypal’s payment system to successfully scam people. Basically, someone will use Paypal to purchase Bitcoin, then claim that they didn’t receive anything. Since Bitcoin is largely anonymous, Paypal will often refund the “purchaser” while the seller is out their bitcoins.\nAs a result of the above complications and considerations, buying Bitcoin with Paypal can be tricky. However, there are still workarounds. Let’s go over some methods for using Paypal to purchase Bitcoin. Using eToro to Buy Bitcoin with Paypal\nKey Considerations for using eToro to purchase Bitcoin eToro is only for traders outside of the United States Your’re not buying Bitcoins i.e. you can’t use eToro to make purchases or buy other digital currencies\nFor those non-American Bitcoin investors who only want to profit off of the price swings, eToro is arguably the simplest way to go. You can buy a “Contract for Difference” from eToro, and then when prices rise, you can sell them back through eToro.\nYou will never actually own bitcoins, but rather, through the CFD, eToro will pay you the difference should Bitcoin prices rise. So, for example, if you buy a CFD with Bitcoin valued at $6,000 and prices rise to $7,000, you will be able to conclude your CFD and eToro will pay you the difference. Using Virwox to buy Bitcoins with Paypal\nKey Considerations for using Virwox to purchase Bitcoin Reliable method for using Paypal to purchase Bitcoin Takes several steps and costs can add up\nVirwox is among the oldest and most reliable methods for using Paypal to safely buy Bitcoin. Virwox stands for The Virtual World Exchange and is one of the largest virtual currency exchanges in the world. Conveniently, you can make deposit on Virwox via Paypal. Be warned, however, that there are fees.\nVirwox came up with a little workaround to mitigate the charge back issues Paypal has with Bitcoin exchanges. To buy Bitcoin with Paypal through Virwox, you’ll first make a deposit with Paypal to Virwox. Using this deposit you will then buy Second Life Linden (SLL) Dolalrs, the most commonly used exchange currency on Virwox. The SLLs will allow you to buy Bitcoin on Virwox which can later be changed back to SLL and from there to fiat. Needless to say each of these steps has a fee.\nIn order to protect itself, Virwox does place certain limitations on trading activities. These include: Initial limits on trading activity for Paypal and credit card charges. It can take up to 48 hours before a trade is processed.\nRegardless, the Paypal to SLL to BTC method remains among the “easier” methods for using Paypal to purchase Bitcoin. In order to use this method: Set up an account on the website Activate the account (Important – change the initial password!) Deposit money to your account with Paypal Use your deposit to buy SLL Use SLL to buy BTC Please note, Virwox will manually review the transaction. It may take up to 48 hours for your transaction to be reviewed\nConclusion: Virwox is a Reliable Albeit Expensive and Complicated Method\nAre you going to get your bitcoins following the above steps? Probably. However, some people do find their efforts denied. At the same time, even those people who end up having their bitcoin purchases blocked do receive their money back. This is less than ideal, but it’s far better than being scammed out of your cash.\nIf your transaction is approved, you’re going to have to pay for it. Virwox doesn’t have terrible fees, but you will be paying fees at every step. Since you have to first pay the transaction fees to acquire SLL, and then later pay fees to buy BTC, you’re basically being double charged. Fees also tend to change on a whim. All in all, not fun. Use Paypal to buy a BTC Debit Card Through Wirex\nKey Considerations for using Wirex to purchase Bitcoin Using Wirex can be slow. Often up to ten days to complete the transaction Middle of the pack fees, not too expensive but not exactly cheap\nWirex offers a unique solution for getting your hands on Bitcoin via Paypal: buy a debit card loaded with Bitcoin. Generally, Paypal doesn’t stand in the way of prepaid debit cards. Since you’re buying through a company and the transaction is easier to trace, you can use Paypal to get your BTC visa debit card. Before getting started, make sure funds are deposited into your Paypal account.\nProcess to acquire BTC Debit Card from Wirex Go to Wirex’s website and open an account. Request a new card, chose either physical or digital card. Connect your Paypal to the debit card. Now you’ll need to verify your Paypal. A small charge will be billed to your account. Look at the charge, there will be a four digit code next to the transaction. This is your pin, take note of it. Go to your wallet on Wirex and withdraw funds to the debit card. Please note, it may take a full week for the funds to appear on Wirex. Now, use your deposited funds to buy BTC. Keep it Local with LocalBitcoins\nKey Considerations for using LocalBitcoins to purchase Bitcoin A P2P platform, so costs can be high Risk of scams is also very real Escrow service does reduce risks\nLocalBitcoins is an online platform that allows you to arrange transactions directly with sellers (or buyers if you want to sell). This makes it a P2P platform that enables direct trading between individual buyers and sellers. You can conduct the trades online by arranging payment terms with real, live individuals. The money can be placed in an escrow while the transactions are carried out.\nLocalBitcoins also allows you to arrange meetings with sellers whom you can then purchase Bitcoins from. Yes, this means meeting someone in real life and arranging a deal. Think of it like Craigslist or a similar online forum. There are some upsides and downsides to this. Obviously, meeting someone in person can be a bit of a hassle. Make sure you take all the precautions you’d usually take when meeting a stranger. That means meeting them in public, during daylight hours, and being careful with the cash you might be carrying with you.\nFurther, LocalBitcoins can be quite expensive. Since the platform is more of a matchmaking service than an exchange, there are risks. However, Local Bitcoins’ escrow service does offers some protection.\nSo how do you use LocalBitcoin to buy Bitcoin? Conduct a search for Bitcoin sellers near you Evaluate sellers You’ll be able to see their reputation and feedback They will also be able to see feedback regarding you They will set a variety of terms, such as transaction history Another P2P Platform- Paxful Another P2P platform, so costs can be high.

This should come as no surprise. After all, Paypal is one of the Internet’s largest online payment processors while Bitcoin is currency. The two should be a match made in heaven, right?\nActually, selling bitcoin may violate Paypal’s terms and services. For one, Paypal prohibits activity that “(h) involves currency exchanges or check cashing businesses.” While the debate over whether bitcoin is a digital asset or currencies continues to rise, the above prohibition adds complications for bitcoin traders.\nSecond, scammers have been using a quirk in Paypal’s payment system to successfully scam people. Basically, someone will use Paypal to purchase Bitcoin, then claim that they didn’t receive anything. Since Bitcoin is largely anonymous, Paypal will often refund the “purchaser” while the seller is out their bitcoins.\nAs a result of the above complications and considerations, buying Bitcoin with Paypal can be tricky. However, there are still workarounds. Let’s go over some methods for using Paypal to purchase Bitcoin. Using eToro to Buy Bitcoin with Paypal\nKey Considerations for using eToro to purchase Bitcoin eToro is only for traders outside of the United States Your’re not buying Bitcoins i.e. you can’t use eToro to make purchases or buy other digital currencies\nFor those non-American Bitcoin investors who only want to profit off of the price swings, eToro is arguably the simplest way to go. You can buy a “Contract for Difference” from eToro, and then when prices rise, you can sell them back through eToro.\nYou will never actually own bitcoins, but rather, through the CFD, difference should Bitcoin prices rise. So, for example, if you buy a CFD with Bitcoin valued at $6,000 and prices rise to $7,000, you will be able to conclude your CFD and difference. Using Virwox to buy Bitcoins with Paypal\nKey Considerations for using Virwox to purchase Bitcoin Reliable method for using Paypal to purchase Bitcoin Takes several steps and costs can add up\nVirwox is among the oldest and most reliable methods for using Paypal to safely buy Bitcoin. Virwox stands for The Virtual World Exchange and is one of the largest virtual currency exchanges in the world. Conveniently, you can make deposit on Virwox via Paypal. Be warned, however, that there are fees.\nVirwox came up with a little workaround to mitigate the charge back issues Paypal has with Bitcoin exchanges. To buy Bitcoin with Paypal through Virwox, you’ll first make a deposit with Paypal to Virwox. Using this deposit you will then buy Second Life Linden (SLL) Dolalrs, the most commonly used exchange currency on Virwox. The SLLs will allow you to buy Bitcoin on Virwox which can later be changed back to SLL and from there to fiat. Needless to say each of these steps has a fee.\nIn order to protect itself, Virwox does place certain limitations on trading activities. These include: Initial limits on trading activity for Paypal and credit card charges. It can take up to 48 hours before a trade is processed.\nRegardless, the Paypal to SLL to BTC method remains among the “easier” methods for using Paypal to purchase Bitcoin. In order to use this method: Set up an account on the website Activate the account (Important – change the initial password!) Deposit money to your account with Paypal Use your deposit to buy SLL Use SLL to buy BTC Please note, Virwox will manually review the transaction. It may take up to 48 hours for your transaction to be reviewed\nConclusion: Virwox is a Reliable Albeit Expensive and Complicated Method\nAre you going to get your bitcoins following the above steps? Probably. However, some people do find their efforts denied. At the same time, even those people who end up having their bitcoin purchases blocked do receive their money back. This is less than ideal, but it’s far better than being scammed out of your cash.\nIf your transaction is approved, you’re going to have to pay for it. Virwox doesn’t have terrible fees, but you will be paying fees at every step. Since you have to first pay the transaction fees to acquire SLL, and then later pay fees to buy BTC, you’re basically being double charged. Fees also tend to change on a whim. All in all, not fun. Use Paypal to buy a BTC Debit Card Through Wirex\nKey Considerations for using Wirex to purchase Bitcoin Using Wirex can be slow. Often up to ten days to complete the transaction Middle of the pack fees, not too expensive but not exactly cheap\nWirex offers a unique solution for getting your hands on Bitcoin via Paypal: buy a debit card loaded with Bitcoin. Generally, Paypal doesn’t stand in the way of prepaid debit cards. Since you’re buying through a company and the transaction is easier to trace, you can use Paypal to get your BTC visa debit card. Before getting started, make sure funds are deposited into your Paypal account.\nProcess to acquire BTC Debit Card from Wirex Go to Wirex’s website and open an account. Request a new card, chose either physical or digital card. Connect your Paypal to the debit card. Now you’ll need to verify your Paypal. A small charge will be billed to your account. Look at the charge, there will be a four digit code next to the transaction. This is your pin, take note of it. Go to your wallet on Wirex and withdraw funds to the debit card. Please note, it may take a full week for the funds to appear on Wirex. Now, use your deposited funds to buy BTC. Keep it Local with LocalBitcoins\nKey Considerations for using LocalBitcoins to purchase Bitcoin A P2P platform, so costs can be high Risk of scams is also very real Escrow service does reduce risks\nLocalBitcoins is an online platform that allows you to arrange transactions directly with sellers (or buyers if you want to sell).

Chanos said that in the event of a global crisis, it would be “better” to own food, or a government-backed ( fiat ) currency. Speaking to the Institute for New Economic Thinking and quoted by various media outlets, Chanos, who last year stated he “didn’t understand” Bitcoin or blockchain technology, issued stark warnings about cryptocurrency investment. “We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he told Bloomberg. He also called the past year’s increased public interest in Bitcoin part of the “fraud cycle,” adding: “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.” Chanos added that in the event of a global crisis, governments would step in with fiat currency as lenders of last resort, an option unavailable to cryptocurrency, given its decentralized nature: “For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.” The well known short-seller, who predicted the fall of Enron, joins an ever-decreasing pool of steadfast Bitcoin naysayers.

The officials said that there some situational cases in connection with Kundra and therefore he has been asked to record his statement.\nRecently, the Enforcement Directorate had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against GainBitcoin website. Sources claimed that the Indian crypto investor, Amit Bhardwaj , and eight others have launched the website. The declarations are such that about 8000 investors lost around Rs 2000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme. Amit Bhardwaj\nEarlier the Pune Police had arrested Bhardwaj and his sibling Vivek as ED had filed FIR against them. However, the Bhardwaj was in connection with firms like GB21, MCAP, GBMiners, and GainBitcoin.\nMeanwhile, the situation regarding Raj Kundra is not yet cleared. Although he is not new to the controversies, he was recently involved in IPL betting scandal. Thus, a ban is imposed on Kundra for life from all cricket activities. Noticeably, the authorization he co-owns, Royal Rajasthan was also banned for 2 years and recently made a comeback in last IPL season.\nRecently, the income tax department had issued notices to bitcoin traders for those whose trades more than Rs1 crore. Even, several times RBI cautioned bitcoin users regarding high risk involved with crypto trading. In last Monetary Policy Committee meeting, RBI said banks are not allowed to deal with crypto trading. The RBI surveyed that around 3 million people in India deal in Rs 100 to 200 crore worth of crypto assets each day. RBI stated in a circular that was released on April 6, 2018,\n“Reserve Bank has repeatedly through its public notices on December 24, 2013, February 01, 2017 and December 05, 2017, cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies. Including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies.
