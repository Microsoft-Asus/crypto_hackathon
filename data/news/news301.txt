I'm so glad today to come back to discuss about the sophistication of blockchain technology with a very interesting project called Spindle. What is Spindle and how does it work? Let's see together !!\nABOUT SPINDLE\nSPINDLE is an investment management platform or asset with information that can not be changed and highly transparent based on blockchain and smart contract technology.\nIt records operator plans, history and performance with cryptocurrency using blockchain technology, so customers can assess investment options based on information that can not be falsified. Also, customers make direct investments using SPINDLE currency, so no third parties can intervene in the investment process. The investment is immediately recorded in blockchain using intelligent contract technology so that the relationship between investors and asset managers is made on the same terms without the need for conventional banks or securities firms to act as intermediaries.\nSPINDLE recognizes that investment is very difficult for trendy professionals and investors so the project aims to create a platform where private and non-professional investors can find huge investment funds around the world to invest and take advantage.\nBasically it is a kind of fund, which can also be an intermediary platform that allows users to invest smarter, especially for cryptocurrency.\nWith Spindle, users can invest in ICO / crypto direct projects or invest in worldwide leading funds listed on the platform and benefit from the funds.\nThe Spindle platform itself does not develop self-managed funds.\nSPINDLE will provide information gathering tools, market trends for analysis and evaluation, and the launch of the SPINDLE Service Application (SPA) app on desktop & mobile platforms to help users reach updated information, invest in funds, and track your assets.\nSPINDLE believes that building a fair relationship between investors and asset managers is the best way to remove a clear investor insecurity about asset investment / management, and the underlying transparency and reliability of information will serve as a catalyst for more people to engage in investment / proactive assets.\nCurrently, the investment option in Spindle is to invest in a global digital currency manager, but in the future, promising startups seeking funding and crowdfunding will be added to the list of investment options.\nSPINDLE believes that everyone invests in a variety of investment options with clear aims and objectives so that they can not only earn conventional value in terms of profits, but also to enjoy independent lives, and experience the richness of life and thought through their investments and their contributions.\nSPINDLE HISTORY\nIn 2017, Japanese steel giant, Kobe Steel, Ltd. (TSE5406) was found guilty of deliberately falsifying a series of data and all of this was due to human risk factors. The company is now experiencing a management crisis.\nBefore investing is a difficult and complicated field to generate profit, not to mention the public debt crisis or bubbles and the manipulation of the crypto market. One can not trace and synthesize all useful information flows, but can be collective.\nSpindle was born for that reason. Basically it is a kind of fund, which can also be an intermediary platform that allows users to invest smarter, especially for cryptocurrency.\nSpindle is designed by Blackstar, a company founded by finance, investment, legal, and technology experts. Compared to other projects, the project is enormous, aiming to see the overall investment market in general at the hedge / fundraising level around the world.\nThe Platform accepts payments with a custom token, called a Spindle token.\nSPINDLE OBJECTIVES\nThe SPINDLE project aims to educate people, without much investment experience, that investment and asset management are a fun way to enrich their lives and minds through SPINDLE.\nThe past few years have witnessed a global credit crunch such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the Greek financial crisis. These are just a few examples of financial collapse from conventional centralized states and their central banks. On the other hand, Bitcoin and other digital currencies have emerged, rapidly developing a decentralized market where individuals can assess and increase the value of the currency.\nSPINDLE believes that, in this broadly decentralized decentralized market, people engage in investment and asset management on an equitable basis for the purpose of not only improving their assets, but also enjoying the process and bringing in daily life that is enriched and independent.\nSPINDLE is the first investment management or asset management platform in which centralized authority is removed and more people can enjoy investing or managing their assets on an equal footing.\nThe SPINDLE project aims to enable more people to enjoy enriched lives through investment and asset management, and to be free of conventional, exploitative social structures based on centralized authority.\nABOUT TOKEN\nToken name: Spindle token\nCode: SPD Standard: ERC-20 (blockchain Ethereum) Row: Utilities Total supply: 10 billion SPD ICO price: 1 ETH = 3000 SPD ICO: 29.04 - 15.05 Softcap: 60 000 ETH, earned in Private-Sale!

TokenMarket offers cross-promotion opportunities for media partners. As of October 2017, there were ICO coin gross sales price $2.3 billion had been executed throughout the year and it is more than 10 occasions as much as in all ICO coin gross sales final 12 months. Through the use of moneyball-like knowledge analytics, Balina explains, he's increased his proportion of worthwhile ICO investments from one-in-eight to a half. This prevents them from dumping the tokens put up-ICO. From the earliest days of bitcoin to the present orgy of initial coin offerings , there's been a basic tension on the coronary heart of the cryptocurrency community. PressCoin is issuing a new mobile mining litcube cryptocurrency (ticker NEWS ) by means of a crowd-sale. One of many hardest financial regulators in Israel has made some surprisingly optimistic feedback immediately concerning the acceptance of ICO crowdfunding and cryptocurrency. If you have any type of inquiries relating to where and how to utilize mobile strip mining machine at echat ( windspin.ru ), you could call us at our site. Investors in such sham ICO campaigns have zero chances of getting any returns on their funding. I can not think about that an previous woman (a chief consumer of coupons) would have the technical skills to open an account on an change to be able to change tokens into a few dollars after which get them despatched to her checking account. During the ICO, the undertaking staff sells digital tokens for crypto-currencies or fiat money to buyers. Two other additions embody Antshares, who offered 17.5 million tokens and not too long ago Bancor raised $140million in just a few hours. The 2 enterprise traces will continue to operate independently: Blockchain Information will stay an ad-supported information website; Token Report will stay a subscription-based monetary knowledge provider. Collective knowledge of the total value for ICOs in 2017 accounts for $three.2 billion.Its place on the Bitcoin blockchain gave it some additional features which might be alien to the Bitcoin base. Each blockchain and cryptocurrency provide an exciting prospect for brand new and present traders to make excessive returns. His project, a cryptocurrency fee system permitting to pay in bitcoins using a plastic card, raised around $80 m throughout its ICO. Bitcoin has remained incredibly valuable, but has seen its market share shrink as new options have sprung up. What hasn't x3tc mobile mining nividium at e-chat changed, although, is how difficult these currencies are to get hold of and trade in, not to mention spend wherever. Now that Energy Ledger has successfully executed the ICO, the company would be specializing in creating its blockchain based peer to see vitality marketplace. Basically, Rental Coin is proof of ownership of mobile mining a shared asset — vehicles —making investors in the ICO eligible for a portion of the money the mobile mining corporate earns by renting vehicles. In the US, initiatives like SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) are being created to assist firms stay compliant. To contribute, backers buy a venture's token with the hope that it will give them access to a know-how platform, or admire in value like an funding. Meanwhile, prices for bitcoin continue to climb and now top $7,000 , regardless of warnings from Warren Buffet among others that the market is a bubble. In comparison with the kind of tools and on-demand financial analysis to which equities merchants have access, the cryptocurrency mobile mining crusher mining market is drastically underserved. Guo described the Seratio Token as the subsequent bitcoin … it is higher than bitcoin\" (CCEG University of Cambridge conference on Internet of Value, November 2016). This might sound obvious, but with all the hype round blockchain technology and its disruptive potential, it may be easy to latch on to an thought the second its whitepaper mentions a large trade the project is purportedly tackling. The U.S. Securities and Alternate Commission has filed fees in opposition to two organizers of a $15 million preliminary coin providing. Analysts call the UK a extremely lively state on the cryptocurrency and ICO market. Energi Mine is a Manchester, UK-primarily based know-how firm based in 2016 that makes use of superior applied sciences akin to Synthetic Intelligence (AI) and blockchain to trade and handle power on behalf of blue-chip clients. Atomico's research is based on data compiled by California-primarily based TokenData and stretches back to 2014, though more than 90% of ICO activity has taken place this 12 months, researcher Ricky Tan stated. Chinese ICO platform ICOINFO () said in a notice on Tuesday that it has stopped all ICO companies and is working with groups that issued digital tokens on its platform to return funds to traders. There are different clues for detecting questionable ICOs, he mentioned, like amateurish web sites, a scarcity of coverage on news websites and business blogs, a scarcity of official documentation, and a puffed-up sales method that fails to warn of potential risks. Nonetheless, because of the set pace, the ATB Coin cryptocurrency, created on the premise of the most superior applied sciences - Lightning Community, SegWit and Smart Contracts, can develop in price till the tip of the ICO, which is planned to happen for a month. Switzerland, along with Germany and Austria dwarf different components of Europe with $976 million raisedin phrases of capital - thrice the funding ICOs attracted in Central and Japanese Europe and 4 instances greater than Britain and Ireland. For a begin, ICO simply means Initial Coin Offering. When Blockchain Information writers get a tip on a noteworthy challenge that is underneath the radar, depend on that info getting into Token Report's databases.

Gox bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi is gearing up for another round of bitcoin selling. According to Blockchain.info, 8,200 BTC was moved from the fund's cold wallet. In response, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $9,000 over fears the coins may be sold on the online exchange market and not on OTC platforms.\nBitcoin Falls Below $9,000 in the Wake of Latest Mt. Gox Selloff Bitcoin has been on a high over the last three weeks. From having its first consecutive weekly gains, the number one crypto appeared to be on the resurgence. In the last few days, negative comments from Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and now reports of another substantial Mt. Gox selloff seems to be affecting the bitcoin price. The transfers are reported to have occurred in the early hours of May 10.\nSeveral crypto monitors are accusing the Mt. Gox trustee of dumping the coins on the exchange market. These reports are still unconfirmed, but some commentators say it is a way of shorting the market. According to Cryptoground , the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trust still has a balance of 137, 891 BTC. Cryptoground is a website that monitors the cold wallet of the defunct platform's bankruptcy trust. Kobayashi earlier said that he planned to sell the remaining Mt. Gox crypto holdings over the coming months.\nSomeone please tell the drunk Mt. Gox trustee person to stop using cryptocurrency exchanges and move to the over-the-counter market.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 11, 2018\nCharting the Effect of Past Selloffs on Bitcoin Prices In March 2018, Kobayashi denied that his sale of $400 million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash caused the prices to crash. Bitcoin rose in value in late 2017 almost eclipsing the $20,000 in mid-December. By the start of February 2018, the crypto had plunged to below $6,000. Many were quick to point fingers at the trustee who in his defense said sales took place on OTC avenues.\nNevertheless, many argued that OTC buyers could immediately dump bitcoin on online exchanges, inducing panic and causing the price to plummet. Indeed, careful examination of some online exchanges shows a spike in bitcoin sell orders in the immediate aftermath of Mt. Gox selloffs. There is no denying the fact that significant price corrections have occurred in the wake of all Mt. Gox selloffs.\nMt. Gox was once the most prominent Bitcoin exchange until it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after suffering a series of hacks.\nDo you think the Mt. Gox selloffs are affecting the bitcoin price?

Bitcoin had been closing in on $10,000, but it fell nearly 6% Sunday and was down another 2% Monday to just over $9,300. Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a bitcoin bear for years. He has often compared the cryptocurrency to gold, saying that both assets are strictly speculative and don't produce earnings and dividends like stocks do. Before the Berkshire annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett told CNBC that bitcoin was \"probably rat poison squared.\"\nDuring the meeting itself, Buffett joked that \"if you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it's a couple tenths of a percent.\" What Buffett was saying about bitcoin was that you can buy it, but it will never produce anything of value.\nHe also responded to a question from the audience about bitcoin by saying that it and other crytpocurrencies \"will come to bad endings.\"\nBerkshire vice chairman and longtime Buffett confidant Charlie Munger was even more blunt.\n\"I like cryptocurrencies a lot less than you do,\" Munger said to Buffett. \"To me, it's just dementia. It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can't be left out.\"\nMunger has also referred to bitcoin as poison. At the shareholder meeting of The Daily Journal (DJCO), a newspaper publisher in Los Angeles where Munger serves as chairman, he called it \"noxious.\"\nStrong words. But to be fair to bitcoin bulls, both Buffett and Munger have been wrong about the cryptocurrency. Buffett in particular. He first called bitcoin a \"mirage\" in 2014 — back when it was trading for about $600. So even with the recent pullback, bitcoin has drastically outperformed the broader market, not to mention Berkshire stock and top Berkshire holdings like Apple.\nThat's why some cryptocurrency experts think that investors should ignore Buffett's and Munger's repeated bitcoin bashing.\n\"What I do find monumentally baffling is that two of the world's most successful investors cannot see the intrinsic value of some form of cryptocurrency,\" Nigel Green, CEO of financial consulting firm deVere Group, wrote in a report early Monday.\n\"Do they honestly believe that there is no place for, and no value of, digital, global currencies in an increasingly digitalized and globalized world?\" Green added.\nSource: CNN ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:41:00.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9ffddcdbe48fb82fc2f42b2a447add41c9eb937", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNdPQCNvvbrFoukKZyDDwWREijLGj9uTBh62aVwmQ611exOJC7s_ao4QbWf98HW31T", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin opportunity - \"Australia Bans Cash For All Purchases Over $7,500 Starting July of 2019\"", "title_full": "Bitcoin opportunity - \"Australia Bans Cash For All Purchases Over $7,500 Starting July of 2019\"", "published": "2018-05-11T19:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9ffddcdbe48fb82fc2f42b2a447add41c9eb937", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNdPQCNvvbrFoukKZyDDwWREijLGj9uTBh62aVwmQ611exOJC7s_ao4QbWf98HW31T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T19:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin opportunity - \"Australia Bans Cash For All Purchases Over $7,500 Starting July of 2019\"", "text": "Bitcoin opportunity - \"Australia Bans Cash For All Purchases Over $7,500 Starting July of 2019\"\n/u/gerikson\nsubmitted by /u/gerikson\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:41:01.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8d591ce10b5676d7fb2948c2e959258b4c78ef0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZrEzjSjH05TBZvaFnGEL7I-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Is it a good buying price for bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is it a good buying price for bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-11T19:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.044, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8d591ce10b5676d7fb2948c2e959258b4c78ef0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZrEzjSjH05TBZvaFnGEL7I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ryanpogi", "published": "2018-05-11T19:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is it a good buying price for bitcoin?", "text": "At my opinion bitcoin still overpriced, $9K per things that can't even be useful in real life?

As a result, several investors dealt with losses in the tens of thousands.\nThe push now is to have developers held accountable for their negligence.\nFrom CoinGeek.com :\nTokenisation and smart contracts will bring Bitcoin Cash directly head-to-head against Ethereum. With Bitcoin Cash stepping in the game—resurrecting previously deactivated OP_Codes that would unleash its smart contracts functionalities, it can effectively give Ethereum a run for its money. nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen says the resurrection of these functionalities will propel the network to the forefront of the industry.\n“The second key upgrade is restoring certain OP_codes that had been deactivated in the Bitcoin script language. These OP_codes are being brought back to Bitcoin Cash to enable the ability for tokenisation and smart contract execution on the BCH network. This will be a game-changer in the cryptocurrency space because it makes Bitcoin Cash the clear leader, with the ability to do all in one coin-efficient payments and advanced technical functions such as tokenisation and smart contracts – what many other coins and blockchains separately claim to do. We at nChain and other groups have already been working on new tokenisation solutions to implement on Bitcoin Cash.”\nnChain issued a statement regarding the anticipated improvements coming to Bitcoin Cash as a result.\n“The restoring of certain OP_Codes in the Bitcoin scripting language will bring advanced technical functionality to the Bitcoin Cash network. In computing, operating codes are the section of automated language which dictates what operation must be performed. The restored OP_Codes will enable tokenisation and smart contracts to be executed on the BCH blockchain. More advanced functions will be possible with future upgrades to the Bitcoin Cash network.\n\"Tokenisation – of financial instruments, assets, rewards, or for Initial Coin Offering (ICO) purposes – and the ability to make use of smart contracts, means that Bitcoin Cash can be used to do anything that other blockchains such as Ethereum, can do. Bitcoin Cash is already a superior payment system, because it is fast, low-fee and allows borderless transactions to anywhere in the world. With these additional technical capabilities, Bitcoin Cash can be the all-in-one coin,” they wrote.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coingeek.com/upcoming-network-upgrade-smart-contracts-bitcoin-cash/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum writt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cecille de jesus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T08:14:54.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b557ae09d7fd6016a3ba4418b69279e265d24f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qgUFhIigY1IyrHtlcGWh.RPDkkB.0wWMEAjFTU3Hp2inAd6j14Xc00QiS7rQLIyRZGuLZKvfgMRg", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] looks to take #3 position from Ripple [XRP]", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] looks to take #3 position from Ripple [XRP]", "published": "2018-05-11T19:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b557ae09d7fd6016a3ba4418b69279e265d24f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qgUFhIigY1IyrHtlcGWh.RPDkkB.0wWMEAjFTU3Hp2inAd6j14Xc00QiS7rQLIyRZGuLZKvfgMRg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-11T19:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] looks to take #3 position from Ripple [XRP]", "text": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] looks to take #3 position from Ripple [XRP] May 12, 2018\nRipple [XRP] is feeling the burn from Bitcoin Cash [BCH], with a $3 billion difference in the overall market cap of the two.

Hold tight, XRP’s enemies can see the writing on the wall.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:47:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a8b30ea4294e66a1665a5ea58db5500ed2046c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXQpNEcF2OkTjytnHqNG1m59qSRvdXp4MfoGYimBufkWm9Rgsk5koFpvb4eTKz0gvoJmrgocBgzHACcf5K3tNRrbr18.nLkj0ruMYWawC1AB94YljG32jtCewjl5rjwThfNtlVZKHhvg--", "site_full": "www.globalbankingandfinance.com", "site": "globalbankingandfinance.com", "site_section": "http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/feed/rss/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Russia Is Ready For The Large Scale Legal Bitcoin Mining Operation", "title_full": "Russia Is Ready For The Large Scale Legal Bitcoin Mining Operation", "published": "2018-05-11T19:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gb110518-47.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16077, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a8b30ea4294e66a1665a5ea58db5500ed2046c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXQpNEcF2OkTjytnHqNG1m59qSRvdXp4MfoGYimBufkWm9Rgsk5koFpvb4eTKz0gvoJmrgocBgzHACcf5K3tNRrbr18.nLkj0ruMYWawC1AB94YljG32jtCewjl5rjwThfNtlVZKHhvg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GBAF Mag", "published": "2018-05-11T19:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russia Is Ready For The Large Scale Legal Bitcoin Mining Operation", "text": "May 11, 2018 Minery, The Large Scale Legal Crypto Mining Facility Powered By Cheapest Green Siberian Electricity Russia will become home to one of the biggest in the world legal mining operations, located in Siberia. Two Russian businessmen Ilya Bruman (London Metropolitan University, MBA Finance) and Alexey Paikin (Lomonosov MSU Business School, MA, Management) are launching in the Irkutsk region the largest legal platform for crypto currency mining in Russia – Minery ( mnry.io ). 5 mining complexes with a total capacity of 55 megawatts and the area of 59,200 square feet will launch in October 2018 and will allow to mine legally at the lowest electricity rates in the Russian Federation and the world (0.04 USD, including tax). As bitcoin popularity is rising worldwide, mining farms, home units and massive mining operations appear. In Russia, with its energy resources and climate making some of the best conditions for crypto mining, this led to more than 1.5 million Russians being engaged in home mining (solo-mining). Such type of mining has yet a number of restrictions: noisy, unproductive, fire-hazardous, requires constant attention, time and maintenance costs. What’s more important, it is not always legal. The bigger farms are often located in abandoned factories and buildings and depend on electricity from subsidised sources, which is prohibited and leads to Russian authorities shutting them down. In June 2018, when Russia adopts the law on the regulation of the crypto currency, the majority of such businesses will become illegal. “Having been mining since 2016, we have encountered restrictions of home mining. We thought on how to scale the business and use electricity legally to act in the legal field. Having found a solution for our business, we tried to satisfy all market needs – hence the idea was born to build a comprehensive infrastructure, providing high-efficient, powerful, stable electricity supply for our investors, ensuring smooth operation of their mining businesses. “– Ilya Bruman, co-founder and CEO of Minery. Minery is absolutely legal solution for “turnkey mining” – the company will procure the equipment, install and configure it, and in case of breakdowns – repair it right on the spot. Such solution has a number of advantages comparing with cloud mining, pools or third-party hosting, according to the project’s WhitePaper. Having signed long-term legal contracts, Minery granted stable uninterrupted power supply and rent of premises for the next 30 years. The partner and power supplier is Bratsk Electric Grid Company JSC (BEGC) – one of the biggest in the Irkutsk region which has been supplying it with electricity for more than 42 years. Mining complexes are located in several cities of the Irkutsk region (Siberia) – Bratsk, Irkutsk and Ust-Ilimsk. The optimum climate conditions and average annual temperature of 28.4 F (-2° Celsius) allow to effectively organise the heat transfer and cooling system for miners, which reduces hosting expenses. The project relies on renewable electricity from high-pressure hydroelectric power plants – the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station, the Irkutsk HPS and the Ust-Ilimsk HPS. The plants are located on the Angara River which drains the lake Baikal – the largest freshwater lake in the world. The total territory of 59,200 square feet (5,500 square meters) gives opportunity to place about 45-55 thousand of mining devices (with the average unit consumption of 800-1500 Watts), supplied directly from the major manufacturers in China. “Some of the most important tasks for miners wishing to achieve the maximum profit is the reduction of energy costs and maintenance of mining equipment, as well as ensuring optimal working conditions and timely repair of equipment in case of its failure. This goal is achieved by placing mining facilities near the sources of the cheapest and most eco-friendly electricity – hydroelectric power stations. This approach reduces not only the cost of generation, but also minimises the cost of delivering electricity to the point of consumption“ –Alexei Paikin, co-founder and managing director of Minery. The main advantage of the project for miners and investors will be favorable conditions for mining, available for MNRY token holders. All tokens are backed by real electrical power and allow using the complex’s capacity rent-free for 30 years. Purchasing 1 MNRY token, the customer gets the right to use 1 Watt of facility’s power for 30 years for placing their equipment at one of the lowest electricity rates in the world (the final price per kWh is 0.04 USD, including VAT). Token holders may use this power capacity to install their own miners or rent it out to other users by renting out their MNRY tokens. In addition to Bitcoin, token holders will be able to mine other popular crypto-currencies: ETH, ETC, LTC, DASH, ZCASH, XMR and others. 100% of all mined coins remain in miners’ wallets with no extra commissions and fees. “Minery is the entrance to the professional mining market without the unnecessary “headache”. The concept of the project assumes one the best conditions for miners: the cheapest power socket in Russia + service and hosting for any modern mining equipment. All communications, starting from security and ventilation to fire-extinguishing and dust removal systems, are made available for Minery clients. We want to make sure that by going to our website, anyone without a technical background can become a full participant in the mining business in just two clicks.“– Kirill Sorokin, co-founder and technical director of Minery.

Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop Tokyo Bitcoin Whale Strikes Again: Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nReports have emerged that the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi is gearing up for another round of bitcoin selling. According to Blockchain.info, 8,200 BTC was moved from the fund’s cold wallet. In response, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $9,000 over fears the coins may be sold on the online exchange market and not on OTC platforms. Bitcoin Falls Below $9,000 in the Wake of Latest Mt. Gox Selloff\nBitcoin has been on a high over the last three weeks. From having its first consecutive weekly gains, the number one crypto appeared to be on the resurgence. In the last few days, negative comments from Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and now reports of another substantial Mt. Gox selloff seems to be affecting the bitcoin price. The transfers are reported to have occurred in the early hours of May 10.\nSeveral crypto monitors are accusing the Mt. Gox trustee of dumping the coins on the exchange market. These reports are still unconfirmed, but some commentators say it is a way of shorting the market. According to Cryptoground , the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trust still has a balance of 137, 891 BTC. Cryptoground is a website that monitors the cold wallet of the defunct platform’s bankruptcy trust. Kobayashi earlier said that he planned to sell the remaining Mt. Gox crypto holdings over the coming months. Someone please tell the drunk Mt. Gox trustee person to stop using cryptocurrency exchanges and move to the over-the-counter market.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 11, 2018 Charting the Effect of Past Selloffs on Bitcoin Prices\nIn March 2018, Kobayashi denied that his sale of $400 million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash caused the prices to crash. Bitcoin rose in value in late 2017 almost eclipsing the $20,000 in mid-December. By the start of February 2018, the crypto had plunged to below $6,000. Many were quick to point fingers at the trustee who in his defense said sales took place on OTC avenues.\nNevertheless, many argued that OTC buyers could immediately dump bitcoin on online exchanges, inducing panic and causing the price to plummet. Indeed, careful examination of some online exchanges shows a spike in bitcoin sell orders in the immediate aftermath of Mt. Gox selloffs. There is no denying the fact that significant price corrections have occurred in the wake of all Mt. Gox selloffs.\nMt. Gox was once the most prominent Bitcoin exchange until it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after suffering a series of hacks.\nDo you think the Mt. Gox selloffs are affecting the bitcoin price? Let us know in the comment section below.\nImages courtesy of Cryptoground, Wikimedia Commons", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchain.info/address/1LncfoCX1yzuiW3hzejarvgZ1WahnAQ4o4", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://bitcoinist.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mt-gox/", "http://bitcoinist.com/mt-gox-trustee-who-sold-400-million-bitcoin-denies-affecting-market-price/", "https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/", "https://twitter.com/iamjosephyoung/status/994891896576270338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nobuaki kobayashi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wake of latest mt. gox selloff bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T00:24:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9013bfc0777c4bf07c12c5303d667c0a654166f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA7Xf0mi2waJxaXtxKe5h5Wp5e8jCVM86Gpc_G.ps7y6XemyiwtFyUcr8nJNCws8SVeyllk7gYRzWgDr082Fskqr.ZJXC6uJ2sPf4WpqKUruoJNKI4XjAP_w5RQGuIfWjdkmj9r2okCVs-", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/investing/feed2/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes - Investing", "title": "The Bitcoin Price Could Top $10,000 After Blockchain Week New York", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Price Could Top $10,000 After Blockchain Week New York", "published": "2018-05-11T19:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F925881884%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9013bfc0777c4bf07c12c5303d667c0a654166f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA7Xf0mi2waJxaXtxKe5h5Wp5e8jCVM86Gpc_G.ps7y6XemyiwtFyUcr8nJNCws8SVeyllk7gYRzWgDr082Fskqr.ZJXC6uJ2sPf4WpqKUruoJNKI4XjAP_w5RQGuIfWjdkmj9r2okCVs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Billy Bambrough", "published": "2018-05-11T19:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Price Could Top $10,000 After Blockchain Week New York", "text": "Blockchain Week New York begins today and the hype surrounding the event could be enough to send the Bitcoin price back above the psychological $10,000 mark for the first time since early March.

Some are either very pro and have quickly jumped on the bandwagon, while others are content to ban , block, and forbid any further discussion. In a May 2, 2018, speech to her colleagues, however, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Pierce revealed a much blurrier distinction. In an open-minded and inquisitive presentation, Pierce explained the difficult challenges of “the creative heart of the financial world” and that which looks to cultivate innovation as well as protect interested parties. Nascent Vocabulary\nThe idea behind a regulatory “sandbox,” something we’re seeing spring up all over the world these days, is highly-attractive for a couple of reasons. First, the emerging crypto economy and distributed technologies are very new, volatile, and full of never-before-seen problems. At the same time, this novelty is coupled with alternative solutions to problems we have been facing since the arrival of the internet.\nWholly unfamiliar financial instruments can now be created in order to match our digital migration better. Trendy concerns about what really happens to our data can be resolved by adding a blockchain (a private or public rendition is, well, another story). Programmable money, of which we can send values in the millions in seconds flat anywhere in the world, opens up huge implications for the financial sector. In general, these new achievements in the field of law, healthcare, entertainment, and publishing mean some serious re-thinking.\nSo how can you minimize the obstacles and maximize the technology? With a sandbox, or as Commissioner Pierce amends, “a beach.” Hester Pierce SEC Image (Source: SEC )\nA sandbox is basically a safe space where innovators, entrepreneurs, and regulators can work together on projects in a certain sector. It helps to break down the Us versus Them barriers on top of which the crypto-anarchist ethos of early-founders built their ideas. It also means a degree of transparency that keeps innovations from being smothered outright. More importantly, it opens the channels of communication between a number of important agents in the cryptosphere.\nFortunately, lawmakers like Commissioner Pierce are taking this process pretty serious. In her speech at the Medici Conference, she astutely points out how things like bitcoin pose existential threats to the very nature of money. The Commissioner stated “It’s money not because of its form, but because of its function” and that “such an analytical approach—defining an instrument by its function, not its form—can be useful when we’re confronted with something that seems entirely new and difficult to categorize.”\nThe honesty in which a regulator is dissecting cryptocurrencies from a financial perspective is indeed soothing. Yes, these are strange and new and sometimes consume huge amounts of energy, but it certainly seems like they deserve some serious attention. Pierce continued:\n“The tokens we’re all so interested in these days aren’t metal and don’t clink. Instead they are [what], exactly? In metaphysical terms, they are sometimes talked about as if they are the gateway to a future that challenges well-established past norms. In physical terms they’re a set of code. In functional terms, well, it depends. And that’s the challenge.” Advertisement advertisement\nNow, we have code that serves as money, and this money can be programmed to do things money has never been done before. Sometimes it behaves as currency, sometimes as a commodity and sometimes as both. It also feels like we’ve only just begun determining what these instruments can actually do:\n“Then there are utility tokens that are designed to function much differently, at least at some point in their lifecycle. These tokens may function as a means of executing a transaction, as a way to get access to a product or service or participate in a community, or in any number of ways that have yet to be dreamed up.”\nThus, a problem of vocabulary is emerging. We don’t really know what to call these things because we still don’t really know what they can do. From a legislative perspective, this is a big problem. Initial Coin Offerings: Howey Says Security\nBrief history lesson; in 1946 there was a court case between the SEC and W.J. Howey Co. regarding how best to apply federal securities laws to the sale of service contracts for an orange grove. More importantly, it has become the de facto reference case when dealing with future securities determinations, even Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) in 2017 and 2018. Howey Test Image (Source: FindLaw )\nFurther to that, the Howey case identified a security as “an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits solely through the efforts of another.” Sounds a lot like the idea behind most offerings for new distributed networks. All these “shitcoins” and “unicorns” alike sell investors on a “ moonshot ” or a massive return on investment for their participation.\nThe problem with this sort of cut-and-paste regulatory stance, especially when comparing laws from the 1940s to emerging technology in 2018, is that we may be curbing innovation potentials we never thought possible. Pierce puts it so:\n“ If the coins offered in ICOs are designated as securities, for example, their development and the development of their offerings will track the contours established by the relevant securities laws and regulations. They will, over time, come to look more and more like securities and securities offerings. Innovations that might otherwise have occurred that don’t fit within that ‘security’ framework may never come to fruition.”\nBy confining ourselves to specific frameworks (i.e. “sandboxes”), we may never end up seeing an idea’s true possibility (i.e. “beaches,” “oceans,” etc.). There, however, are also limits. We needn’t destroy everything, adds Pierce. While innovation is critical and can often improve the quality of life for those who participate in its benefits, a regulator’s job must also include the harmful effects the innovation may portend. It’s a double-edged sword indeed, but Pierce admits her ambition to overcome the “steep learning curve ahead.” My epic list of Bitcoin resources has moved to https://t.co/d2FH36KLv2 & is open source! Submit pull requests here: https://t.co/LY4x9wqVZs\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 17, 2017\nTwo main points, then. Regulate without fear, but don’t be heavy-handed. Seems quite simple, right? Not so fast. After this balancing act, a regulator also faces a third potential trap according to Pierce. In this sentiment, we glean the most eloquent aspects of the Commissioner’s mental model for thinking about things like blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies:\n“ The regulator may insert itself inappropriately into the creative process. The regulator should be careful not to try to control the development of new technologies. Not only is it outside the regulator’s proper function, but such micromanagement can result in the regulator forcing new technology to fit existing—and familiar—regulatory frameworks regardless of whether those frameworks are appropriate. The law deserves respect, but technological progress should not be bound by the limits of the regulator’s lawyerly imagination.”\nPierce, in so many words, is describing the hearth of creativity. She is approaching financial regulation in the same way that crypto assets and their financial potential are reshaping pre-2008 monetary thinking. The Commissioner is aware of old-helm policies and how their framework may not be able to fully encompass things like Ethereum or Filecoin or 0x . In this way, perhaps our leader (on the side of the government) should be Pierce rather than Giancarlo.\nConcluding, this is pretty good news for us in the crypto space. It allieves fears of a secret blanket ban and, if innovators are as curious and courageous as Commissioner Pierce, opens wide channels of communication. With regulation sure on the horizon, we should feel more confident that our crypto-technological ambitions are being due justice. We may even learn a thing or two.

Cryptocurrencies present authorities with more challenges for catching “bad guys,” a company executive said Thursday. Cathy Bessant, Bank of America‘s chief technical officer, set the tone for what she sees as two distinct uses for cryptocurrency: payments and investing. As a form of payment, cryptocurrency is dangerous because it is not in line with banking’s policies for tracking payments. “The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial [movement] of money,” she said, speaking from CNBC’s Capital Exchange breakfast series in Washington, D.C. “Cryptos is the antithesis of that.” She added: As a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent. Casting cryptocurrency in a good guy vs. bad guy narrative is a common theme for traditional banks and investment funds. Executives undervalue key pain points that cryptocurrencies attempt to resolve in the financial sector (such as slow payment settlement and transaction fees), while sounding alarm bells for criminal activity. As CCN reported, Berkshire Hathaway VC Charlie Munger said Bitcoin was almost as “bad as trading baby brains.” Like many large institutions, Bank of America has instituted a policy that bars customers from using its credit cards to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Though Bessant does not see legitimate use cases for crypto as a form of payment, customers can still invest in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — just not with Bank of America-issued credit cards. BofA views cryptocurrencies loosely as stocks. Their customer policies thus reflect this line of thinking. “Just like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards,” Bessant said. So while some banks classify concurrency payments with credit cards as cash advances (with high fees), BofA doesn’t allow them at all. As regulations for cryptocurrency are still in early stages, BofA stands out as a financial giant with a tough stance on the debate. To BofA it seems that the cryptocurrency space is full of hackers and modern day Robin Hoods. However, the bank is making improvements towards security every day, according to Bessant. “Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we’re in a better place,” Bessant said.

Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop Tokyo Bitcoin Whale Strikes Again: Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop 13 hours ago NEWS , tokyo Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 11, 2018 · 12:00 pm\nReports have emerged that the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi is gearing up for another round of bitcoin selling. According to Blockchain.info, 8,200 BTC was moved from the fund’s cold wallet. In response, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $9,000 over fears the coins may be sold on the online exchange market and not on OTC platforms. Bitcoin Falls Below $9,000 in the Wake of Latest Mt. Gox Selloff\nBitcoin has been on a high over the last three weeks. From having its first consecutive weekly gains, the number one crypto appeared to be on the resurgence. In the last few days, negative comments from Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and now reports of another substantial Mt. Gox selloff seems to be affecting the bitcoin price. The transfers are reported to have occurred in the early hours of May 10.\nSeveral crypto monitors are accusing the Mt. Gox trustee of dumping the coins on the exchange market. These reports are still unconfirmed, but some commentators say it is a way of shorting the market. According to Cryptoground, the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trust still has a balance of 137, 891 BTC. Cryptoground is a website that monitors the cold wallet of the defunct platform’s bankruptcy trust. Kobayashi earlier said that he planned to sell the remaining Mt. Gox crypto holdings over the coming months. Someone please tell the drunk Mt. Gox trustee person to stop using cryptocurrency exchanges and move to the over-the-counter market.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 11, 2018 Charting the Effect of Past Selloffs on Bitcoin Prices\nIn March 2018, Kobayashi denied that his sale of $400 million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash caused the prices to crash. Bitcoin rose in value in late 2017 almost eclipsing the $20,000 in mid-December. By the start of February 2018, the crypto had plunged to below $6,000. Many were quick to point fingers at the trustee who in his defense said sales took place on OTC avenues.\nNevertheless, many argued that OTC buyers could immediately dump bitcoin on online exchanges, inducing panic and causing the price to plummet. Indeed, careful examination of some online exchanges shows a spike in bitcoin sell orders in the immediate aftermath of Mt. Gox selloffs. There is no denying the fact that significant price corrections have occurred in the wake of all Mt. Gox selloffs.\nMt. Gox was once the most prominent Bitcoin exchange until it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after suffering a series of hacks.\nDo you think the Mt. Gox selloffs are affecting the bitcoin price?

The CEO of Xapo, Wences Casares, has reportedly marketed the service to tech and finance billionaires, educating them on the \"global currency of the future\" and the importance of safeguarding the digital investment.\nAs per the website, Xapo's vaults are built over five continents, in locations such as underground dugouts, caves, and a Swiss decommissioned military bunker.\nSource: Quartz\nJoon Wong, a journalist with Quartz , holds the distinction of being amongst the few to have been allowed to visit the vault. Speaking about his experience, Wong said:\n\"It's inside a decommissioned Swiss military bunker dug into a granite mountain. Its precise location is secret, and access is limited by security measures that would put a Bond villain to shame.\"\nXapo's client list consists of billionaire family offices, who said that the vault houses $10 billion worth of bitcoin, although the dollar figure may vary due to the asset's infamous price volatility.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the 4 year old Xapo stores 7 percent of the world's bitcoin, which equates to an amount greater than \" 98 percent of the 5,670 banks in the U.S,\" in terms of dollars.\nThe company enjoys different regulations than banks, and has registered each vault as a different subsidiary to account for each location's different regulations. For example, the Swiss location is regulated by the Financial Services Standards Association ( VQF ), and is subject to third party Anti Money Laundering (AML) audits. In contrast, the U.S. customers are served through a Delaware registered entity, and is regulated by the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nTwo Day Bitcoin Withdrawal Process Unsurprisingly, the elaborate security measures don't exactly make withdrawals a breeze, and Xapo's specifies its clients to allow for a period of two days to process withdrawals.\nThe procedure involves verification of a client's identity via FaceTime or Skype, alongside manually confirming transactions with private keys from a minimum of three vault locations.\nHowever, clients can purchase bitcoin via Xapo's private trading desks, and are also offered a bitcoin debit card, which contains a fraction of their total funds, in order to make everyday payments possible.\nSource: Bloomberg\nCasares' salesmen skills are nothing short of extraordinary, as the entrepreneur has won the confidence of several hedge funds and industry personalities. Elaborating on the security measures taken by Xapo for large transfers, is Sean Clark, founder of Canadian cryptocurrency hedge fund First Block :\n\"The vault's fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it's big enough they'll fly out to see us.\"\nCapitalizing on Security Need One of bitcoin's, and the cryptocurrency market's, biggest barriers to entry remains that of custodial services and fund security. Although the currency in itself is immutable, the wallets used to store BTC remain susceptible to hacks, with the mainstream media widely reporting on bitcoin's purported security issues.\nThus, buyers with deep-pockets remain wary of purchasing bitcoin, but the evidence of billions of dollars being brought by institutional buyers shows undeniable interest in the asset class, given extremely reputable security measures.\nAccording to Ryan Radloff of CoinShares:\n\"Everyone who isn't keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo. You couldn't pay me to keep it with a bank.\"\nAn investor-turned-customer, Reid Hoffman, who led a $20 million investment round in 2014, said:\n\"They're the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.\"\nThe post Move Over Cold-Wallets, The World's Elite Store $10 Billion Worth of Bitcoin in Cold-Vaults appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "quartz joon wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallets xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quartz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "billion worth of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:06:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8d50efcfa15387fc1f457b550baf659069a3086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY92WuYs0UyyIcsx0.J_N6GOU5Go_zghEAHxeHYExyuK_fUIpgaiz.8OUu7oub8sSRg--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Warren Buffett is Wrong About Bitcoin, Says Self-Proclaimed ‘Disciple’", "title_full": "Warren Buffett is Wrong About Bitcoin, Says Self-Proclaimed ‘Disciple’", "published": "2018-05-11T19:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8d50efcfa15387fc1f457b550baf659069a3086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY92WuYs0UyyIcsx0.J_N6GOU5Go_zghEAHxeHYExyuK_fUIpgaiz.8OUu7oub8sSRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T19:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Warren Buffett is Wrong About Bitcoin, Says Self-Proclaimed ‘Disciple’", "text": "Chamath Palihapitiya, a technology VC, has called out Warren Buffett on his negative comments about Bitcoin. In a recent interview , the former Facebook executive said Buffett is not an expert on technology. He also reiterated the notion that Bitcoin is digital gold.\nBuffett Knows Little About Technology Speaking during the interview, Palihapitiya said Buffett, the 82-year Berkshire Hathaway CEO, isn't entirely tech-savvy. According to Palihapitiya, knowledge of technology isn't exactly in Buffett's \"circle of competence,\" saying:\nNot everybody is right all the time.\nIndeed, Warren Buffett hasn't always been right. Despite being regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, Buffett has passed up on a few choice investments like Amazon and Google . With cryptocurrency, he remains a staunch critic, recently declaring that buying the crypto wasn't investing but speculating.\nChamath Palihapitiya\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has had a lot of negative things to say about cryptocurrency, calling it a bubble and a mirage. He has even called the number one crypto \"rat poison,\" a view shared by Charles Munger, Buffett's second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger recently referred to the granddaddy of cryptocurrency as a \" noxious poison \" and called for the U.S. to adopt China's crypto crackdown philosophy. According to Buffett, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and does not produce anything.\nPalihapitiya isn't the only one who thinks Buffett knows nothing about technology and cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said earlier in the year that the Berkshire Hathaway chief doesn't understand bitcoin . Recently, Weiss Ratings provided evidence to dispute Buffett's claims that the number one virtual currency has no value.\nBitcoin is a Replacement for Gold Palihapitiya believes Bitcoin is a replacement for gold. The self-proclaimed Buffett disciple identifies with the importance of the cryptocurrency, saying that it bears no correlation with the mainstream market. As a result, it appears like Bitcoin has created a separate world, one that Palihapitiya jokes requires a passport to move from one to the other.\nThe former Facebook executive has owned Bitcoin since 2012. He says that he prefers to view the cryptocurrency as a hedge to the uncertainty of the mainstream market. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, an event that Palihapitiya says broke the confidence of many people in the safety of mainstream finance. As a final thought, Palihapitiya states:\nEverything broke down, and things that we thought were hedges went away.\nDo you think Palihapitiya is correct in saying Warren Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin?

But before that happens, he believes ethereum will take bitcoin’s crypto-crown.\nVer, once known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” told The Independent that so-called technologically superior cryptocurrencies like ethereum and bitcoin cash will surpass bitcoin in value in the coming months and years. Ver sees ethereum surpassing bitcoin by year’s end and bitcoin cash by 2020.\nAnalysts refer to this supposed development as “ The Flippening .”\nVer pointed to slow transaction times and high fees undermining bitcoin. He noted that more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies have entered the market since bitcoin’s 2009 inception in attempts to overcome bitcoin’s “limitations.”\nBitcoin’s rise in value in the last year has carried other cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash outpacing bitcoin. ETH And BCH Outpace Bitcoin Rogver Ver was once known as “Bitcoin Jesus.” Now, he has thrown his weight behind bitcoin cash, which he believes better represents Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for cryptocurrency. | Source: YouTube\nBitcoin’s price has jumped 450% from $1,700 to $9,360 in the past 12 months, while Ethereum has gained 1,000% (to $764) and Bitcoin Cash moved from $500 in August to $1,655.\nEthereum has five times as many units in circulation as bitcoin, making its market cap slightly less than half of bitcoin’s.\nVer stated in January that BCH will continue in its steady growth and surpass BTC in the near future.\n“BCH is the same version of bitcoin that everyone fell in love with and used from 2009 until 2017,” he said. “It has the same economic code that led to it becoming a worldwide phenomenon.

He further noted that bitcoin is by far the best-known cryptocurrency and the reserve cryptocurrency.\nVer acknowledged that bitcoin could remain the top cryptocurrency, but he doesn’t think it is likely. He said bitcoin cash’s utility could drive its price to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile this is not guaranteed, bitcoin cash has more than doubled in the past month, and the interest of big investors could cause its value to double by next week, Ver said.\nIn the short term, though, the entire market has suffered a setback, with both ethereum and bitcion cash taking bigger hits than bitcoin.\nThe cryptocurrency market has declined by more than $50 billion over the past 24 hours, as the bitcoin price declined by more than 8 percent and other major cryptocurrencies along with tokens experienced an intensified movement on the downside.\nWhere bitcoin fell 8.68%, ethereum lost 11.96% and bitcoin cash dropped 17.07%, according to CCN’s cryptocurrency market cap index.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ethereum-price-latest-updates-bitcoin-cash-roger-ver-crytocurrency-flippening-a8345166.html", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T00:11:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91c89077681e4f662e94825889f0f08cfcc7a420", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaUjXfQkr0WttV33Ki0hvejAYJiKGQPIwirsBs7DIzli6tn5fexXb2i8wMgHMGtu8oX_IU3njkqtv2a0RneREveg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "The real reason why Warren Buffett and his cronies do their very best to discredit Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies.", "title_full": "The real reason why Warren Buffett and his cronies do their very best to discredit Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies. : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91c89077681e4f662e94825889f0f08cfcc7a420", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaUjXfQkr0WttV33Ki0hvejAYJiKGQPIwirsBs7DIzli6tn5fexXb2i8wMgHMGtu8oX_IU3njkqtv2a0RneREveg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DestroyerOfShitcoins", "published": "2018-05-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "The real reason why Warren Buffett and his cronies do their very best to discredit Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies.", "text": "submitted by /u/DestroyerOfShitcoins\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgur.com/a/RRamCnV"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:59:37.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfefe69d91408730e5f4121e111c9ea3281e38ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYxVjrHQb96YHtWMh_ih06TaldxuvVeJX.XioSEECyTpe2wFgUKC6kPB50PAdjH5g.Q--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Forget Sandbox’s, SEC Commissioner Pierce Proposes “Bitcoin Beach”", "title_full": "Forget Sandbox’s, SEC Commissioner Pierce Proposes “Bitcoin Beach”", "published": "2018-05-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfefe69d91408730e5f4121e111c9ea3281e38ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYxVjrHQb96YHtWMh_ih06TaldxuvVeJX.XioSEECyTpe2wFgUKC6kPB50PAdjH5g.Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Forget Sandbox’s, SEC Commissioner Pierce Proposes “Bitcoin Beach”", "text": "For many in the regulatory space, the question of cryptocurrencies and how to manage them is seemingly black and white. Some are either very pro and have quickly jumped on the bandwagon, while others are content to ban , block, and forbid any further discussion. In a May 2, 2018, speech to her colleagues, however, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Pierce revealed a much blurrier distinction. In an open-minded and inquisitive presentation, Pierce explained the difficult challenges of \"the creative heart of the financial world\" and that which looks to cultivate innovation as well as protect interested parties.\nNascent Vocabulary The idea behind a regulatory \"sandbox,\" something we're seeing spring up all over the world these days, is highly-attractive for a couple of reasons. First, the emerging crypto economy and distributed technologies are very new, volatile, and full of never-before-seen problems. At the same time, this novelty is coupled with alternative solutions to problems we have been facing since the arrival of the internet.\nWholly unfamiliar financial instruments can now be created in order to match our digital migration better. Trendy concerns about what really happens to our data can be resolved by adding a blockchain (a private or public rendition is, well, another story). Programmable money, of which we can send values in the millions in seconds flat anywhere in the world, opens up huge implications for the financial sector. In general, these new achievements in the field of law, healthcare, entertainment, and publishing mean some serious re-thinking.\nSo how can you minimize the obstacles and maximize the technology? With a sandbox, or as Commissioner Pierce amends, \"a beach.\"\nHester Pierce SEC Image (Source: SEC )\nA sandbox is basically a safe space where innovators, entrepreneurs, and regulators can work together on projects in a certain sector. It helps to break down the Us versus Them barriers on top of which the crypto-anarchist ethos of early-founders built their ideas. It also means a degree of transparency that keeps innovations from being smothered outright. More importantly, it opens the channels of communication between a number of important agents in the cryptosphere.\nFortunately, lawmakers like Commissioner Pierce are taking this process pretty serious. In her speech at the Medici Conference, she astutely points out how things like bitcoin pose existential threats to the very nature of money. The Commissioner stated \"It's money not because of its form, but because of its function\" and that \"such an analytical approach—defining an instrument by its function, not its form—can be useful when we're confronted with something that seems entirely new and difficult to categorize.\"\nThe honesty in which a regulator is dissecting cryptocurrencies from a financial perspective is indeed soothing. Yes, these are strange and new and sometimes consume huge amounts of energy, but it certainly seems like they deserve some serious attention. Pierce continued:\n\"The tokens we're all so interested in these days aren't metal and don't clink. Instead they are [what], exactly? In metaphysical terms, they are sometimes talked about as if they are the gateway to a future that challenges well-established past norms. In physical terms they're a set of code. In functional terms, well, it depends. And that's the challenge.\"\nNow, we have code that serves as money, and this money can be programmed to do things money has never been done before. Sometimes it behaves as currency, sometimes as a commodity and sometimes as both. It also feels like we've only just begun determining what these instruments can actually do:\n\"Then there are utility tokens that are designed to function much differently, at least at some point in their lifecycle. These tokens may function as a means of executing a transaction, as a way to get access to a product or service or participate in a community, or in any number of ways that have yet to be dreamed up.\"\nThus, a problem of vocabulary is emerging. We don't really know what to call these things because we still don't really know what they can do. From a legislative perspective, this is a big problem.\nInitial Coin Offerings: Howey Says Security Brief history lesson; in 1946 there was a court case between the SEC and W.J. Howey Co. regarding how best to apply federal securities laws to the sale of service contracts for an orange grove. More importantly, it has become the de facto reference case when dealing with future securities determinations, even Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) in 2017 and 2018.\nHowey Test Image (Source: FindLaw )\nFurther to that, the Howey case identified a security as \"an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits solely through the efforts of another.\" Sounds a lot like the idea behind most offerings for new distributed networks. All these \"shitcoins\" and \"unicorns\" alike sell investors on a \" moonshot \" or a massive return on investment for their participation.\nThe problem with this sort of cut-and-paste regulatory stance, especially when comparing laws from the 1940s to emerging technology in 2018, is that we may be curbing innovation potentials we never thought possible. Pierce puts it so:\n\" If the coins offered in ICOs are designated as securities, for example, their development and the development of their offerings will track the contours established by the relevant securities laws and regulations. They will, over time, come to look more and more like securities and securities offerings. Innovations that might otherwise have occurred that don't fit within that 'security' framework may never come to fruition.\"\nBy confining ourselves to specific frameworks (i.e. \"sandboxes\"), we may never end up seeing an idea's true possibility (i.e. \"beaches,\" \"oceans,\" etc.). There, however, are also limits. We needn't destroy everything, adds Pierce. While innovation is critical and can often improve the quality of life for those who participate in its benefits, a regulator's job must also include the harmful effects the innovation may portend. It's a double-edged sword indeed, but Pierce admits her ambition to overcome the \"steep learning curve ahead.\"\nMy epic list of Bitcoin resources has moved to https://t.co/d2FH36KLv2 & is open source! Submit pull requests here: https://t.co/LY4x9wqVZs\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 17, 2017\nTwo main points, then. Regulate without fear, but don't be heavy-handed. Seems quite simple, right? Not so fast. After this balancing act, a regulator also faces a third potential trap according to Pierce. In this sentiment, we glean the most eloquent aspects of the Commissioner's mental model for thinking about things like blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies:\n\" The regulator may insert itself inappropriately into the creative process. The regulator should be careful not to try to control the development of new technologies. Not only is it outside the regulator's proper function, but such micromanagement can result in the regulator forcing new technology to fit existing—and familiar—regulatory frameworks regardless of whether those frameworks are appropriate. The law deserves respect, but technological progress should not be bound by the limits of the regulator's lawyerly imagination.\"\nPierce, in so many words, is describing the hearth of creativity. She is approaching financial regulation in the same way that crypto assets and their financial potential are reshaping pre-2008 monetary thinking. The Commissioner is aware of old-helm policies and how their framework may not be able to fully encompass things like Ethereum or Filecoin or 0x . In this way, perhaps our leader (on the side of the government) should be Pierce rather than Giancarlo.\nConcluding, this is pretty good news for us in the crypto space. It allieves fears of a secret blanket ban and, if innovators are as curious and courageous as Commissioner Pierce, opens wide channels of communication. With regulation sure on the horizon, we should feel more confident that our crypto-technological ambitions are being due justice. We may even learn a thing or two.\nThe post Forget Sandbox's, SEC Commissioner Pierce Proposes \"Bitcoin Beach\" appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pierce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hester m. pierce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:06:12.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b42b3ad39451e8e3f54485af8fc023647f8c493a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWUnnBHyUA8rIwwmLpbcHr4E8WhM0qsDmJ6v5Z0FJMD17mvatWSmdxj8MFKCyMrjxVBPG62Ci0rA--", "site_full": "bitsonline.com", "site": "bitsonline.com", "site_section": "http://tokyodailynews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Tokyo Daily News", "title": "Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues", "title_full": "Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues", "published": "2018-05-11T19:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://tokyodailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/TokyoBCH_Meetup1-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b42b3ad39451e8e3f54485af8fc023647f8c493a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWUnnBHyUA8rIwwmLpbcHr4E8WhM0qsDmJ6v5Z0FJMD17mvatWSmdxj8MFKCyMrjxVBPG62Ci0rA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-11T19:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues", "text": "Home / NEWS / Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues 13 hours ago NEWS , tokyo Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues May 11, 2018 by Akane Yokoo\nIn April, organizers of the Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup group gathered for a lunch meeting at a casual Italian restaurant, O’KOK in the city’s trendy Daikanyama district. The Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup started in December 2017, and it was one of the first BCH meetups to form in the world.\nAlso see: Japan Introduces a Five-Point Framework to Prevent Hacks Like Coincheck’s\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts\nAccording to the list of venues that currently accept Bitcoin Cash (managed by founding member of both the BCH and BTC meetups Ken Shishido, and two others) there are currently 19 venues around Tokyo that accept Bitcoin Cash payments — 16 of which are restaurants and bars.\nLocal Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts such as Shishido, Jake Smith and others have been busy approaching venue owners in person around Tokyo, persuading and instructing them on how to start accepting BCH at their venues. Shishido said that since there is no official payment processor for merchants yet, it is not easy to convince a vast number of venues to accept Bitcoin Cash payments, as the only option they have is to use a personal wallet to accept payments — for now.\nO’KOK (pronounced “Oh-koku”) is located just outside Daikanyama station in central Tokyo. If you follow the sign downstairs, you will see an open terrace, accented by a bright color of red on the chairs and the terrace roof, overlooking the railroad. The staff greeted with a smile.\nThe organizers each ordered lunch, which was ¥1,000 JPY ($9.50 USD) each, plus some beers for ¥500 a glass. They said they are happy to support venues that accept Bitcoin Cash wherever they can.\nThe organizers had a chat with staff about the possibility of holding the next meetup at the restaurant. After the lunch, one of the organizers paid the staff ¥5,000 ($47) worth of Bitcoin Cash using a tablet, and the rest paid from personal wallets on their smartphones. The whole payment process seemed smooth and quick.\nThe Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup organizers are covering different areas of the huge metropolis, constantly searching for new venues to accept Bitcoin Cash and also to host the actual meetups.\nTheir goal is to hold a BCH meetup at least once a month at a venue where they have never held a meetup before, in order to spread the usage of Bitcoin Cash throughout Tokyo, and to support those venues by bringing them extra business through holding meetups where attendees purchase food and drinks with Bitcoin Cash or Japanese yen.\nThis forces the organizers to be constantly looking for more venues for the future meetups — a grassroots effort that isn’t always fun or easy, but which the group feels is necessary until awareness is more widespread and adoption is easier.\nHow do enthusiasts spread the word about Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies in your region?

At the same time, executives in charge of refunding users of former Japanese exchange Mt.Gox have evidently sold a new chunk of about 8,000 BTC (about $70 mln at press time) in four batches of 2,000 BTC.\nSuch actions in the past had reportedly affected global prices several times since November. As of press time Friday, Bitcoin had lost around $800, or 8.5 percent, in the past 24 hours, hitting the lowest price the coin has seen since April 20.\nAcross altcoin markets, Ethereum (ETH) posted near 12 percent losses, while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fared worse, both losing about 17 percent over the same period. Market visualization from Coin360 While some local sources took to social media to suggest the price dip was an “overreaction” on the part of cryptocurrency holders, the episode is a test for Korean exchanges, which only recently returned to the listings of popular price tracker resource CoinMarketCap.

Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop May 11, 2018 199\nReports have emerged that the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi is gearing up for another round of bitcoin selling. According to Blockchain.info, 8,200 BTC was moved from the fund’s cold wallet. In response, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $9,000 over fears the coins may be sold on the online exchange market and not on OTC platforms. Bitcoin Falls Below $9,000 in the Wake of Latest Mt. Gox Selloff\nBitcoin has been on a high over the last three weeks. From having its first consecutive weekly gains, the number one crypto appeared to be on the resurgence. In the last few days, negative comments from Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and now reports of another substantial Mt. Gox selloff seems to be affecting the bitcoin price. The transfers are reported to have occurred in the early hours of May 10.\nSeveral crypto monitors are accusing the Mt. Gox trustee of dumping the coins on the exchange market. These reports are still unconfirmed, but some commentators say it is a way of shorting the market. According to Cryptoground , the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trust still has a balance of 137, 891 BTC. Cryptoground is a website that monitors the cold wallet of the defunct platform’s bankruptcy trust. Kobayashi earlier said that he planned to sell the remaining Mt. Gox crypto holdings over the coming months. Someone please tell the drunk Mt. Gox trustee person to stop using cryptocurrency exchanges and move to the over-the-counter market.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 11, 2018 Charting the Effect of Past Selloffs on Bitcoin Prices\nIn March 2018, Kobayashi denied that his sale of $400 million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash caused the prices to crash. Bitcoin rose in value in late 2017 almost eclipsing the $20,000 in mid-December. By the start of February 2018, the crypto had plunged to below $6,000. Many were quick to point fingers at the trustee who in his defense said sales took place on OTC avenues.\nNevertheless, many argued that OTC buyers could immediately dump bitcoin on online exchanges, inducing panic and causing the price to plummet. Indeed, careful examination of some online exchanges shows a spike in bitcoin sell orders in the immediate aftermath of Mt. Gox selloffs. There is no denying the fact that significant price corrections have occurred in the wake of all Mt. Gox selloffs.\nMt. Gox was once the most prominent Bitcoin exchange until it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after suffering a series of hacks.\nDo you think the Mt. Gox selloffs are affecting the bitcoin price?

He's just not right about Bitcoin.\nHere's what Buffett said between Quote: : s with my response following:\nWhen you buy non productive assets all you are counting on is that the next person coming along will pay you more for it. One interesting example is gold.\nThere's some truth to this, but there a lot of unproductive assets people hold. It's not great, but sometimes it's the best you can do. Up to five years out, yield on Euro bonds is negative. You could call these destructive assets.\nSome investors hold them anyway. I guess because they don't want to lose money faster.\nIn line with this argument Buffett, and Munger for that matter, don't like (Euro) bonds or gold.\nHowever, I'd argue Bitcoin is an emerging asset class. At some point, Bitcoin could stabilize at a much higher price per unit. If it is ever an integrated part of society and living up to potential as a payment system and a store of value, it will need to have a much higher price per unit, because it needs to be able to absorb a much larger portion of global reserves, without market impact, as it is capable of doing at the current price. An emerging asset class behaves differently from an established asset like the precious metals. It seems obvious one important difference could be rapid increases in prices of the units. With that being a distinct possibility, things look slightly better.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/LtITDtZPYEw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:26:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fadc688e87f19d0725d131d2cc93760abf6f1439", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStjbcGctx3JdA41B4MltsHtEcjSaW78Cr9mwUBZ7jo2mfPlWOoPzwEagkiW3EEjgBhou7ni.iGrH1VurTuI4IIUrN2lQPst7DAliQbE5jOyg--", "site_full": "techmoran.com", "site": "techmoran.com", "site_section": "http://techmoran.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechMoran", "title": "Bitcoin & The Struggle To Accept The Cryptocurrency In Africa", "title_full": "Bitcoin & The Struggle To Accept The Cryptocurrency In Africa", "published": "2018-05-11T18:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/techmoran.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-1-1.jpeg?fit=470%2C313&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63551, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fadc688e87f19d0725d131d2cc93760abf6f1439", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStjbcGctx3JdA41B4MltsHtEcjSaW78Cr9mwUBZ7jo2mfPlWOoPzwEagkiW3EEjgBhou7ni.iGrH1VurTuI4IIUrN2lQPst7DAliQbE5jOyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dennis Mathu", "published": "2018-05-11T18:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin & The Struggle To Accept The Cryptocurrency In Africa", "text": "Bitcoin & The Struggle To Accept The Cryptocurrency In Africa By\nBitcoin! Bitcoin!! Bitcoin!!! How many times did I can call you? Why are you calling me like a typical African mother? Anyways, it is not your fault because you were once worth as much as $18,000 and you will undoubtedly bounce back. By the way, you definitely do not want to calculate this amount in an African currency! Mtchew!\nBitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middlemen – meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games.\nDespite the fact that Bitcoin has become very popular across the world and you can buy bitcoin without any hassles, some parts of Africa and certain Africans are still struggling to accept bitcoin nor do they want to start the bitcoin discourse.\nJust like the way the acceptance of the internet was laggard and later picked up, Bitcoin is likely to walk the same route. However, from the look of things, it may probably take longer.\nWhy do we say this? The number one reason is that Bitcoin is unregulated. You can buy and sell Bitcoin seamlessly. This is supposed to be an advantage…right? But for many Africans, it is not. It is very prone to fraud.\nFor example, in South Africa recently, as much as $50 million may have been lost by an international group of investors after putting their money into a bitcoin investment group called BTC Global.\nAccording to media reports, more than 27,500 people may have been impacted, with investors spread across South Africa, Australia and the U.S. among other areas. Some victims have reportedly claimed that they lost as much as $117,000 to the scheme. A report like this is always in favour of legal currency.\nThis has prompted several African governments to issue warnings to their citizens against investment in Bitcoin. Nigeria is a good example. These statements are issued because clearly, the government is yet to understand how to regulate and streamline bitcoin as an impregnable means of business transaction.\nAlso, the volatility of Bitcoin is contributing to this skepticism. At the fall of last year, Bitcoin tiptoed past $15,000 and today it’s about $1,000. This means if you invest in Bitcoin, you really need to be ready for huge losses and huge gains.\nUltimately, the lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works is a major setback for the cryptocurrency. A better understanding of how it works will go a long way in making Africans accept and embrace Bitcoin.\nBitcoin: The currency of the future\nIt is undeniable that quite a number of Africans are already trading in Bitcoin. The governments of different African countries only need to evolve ways to regulate it. This is because Bitcoin is the currency of the future. It is easy to buy and sell, it is accepted by a number of ecommerce website and of course, you do not require billions to produce it.\nAs such, whether we like it or not, Bitcoin will find its way to the continent. It will now be a matter of when the government is going to come in to regulate it so that they won’t be late. After all, many governments in Europe and America already recognizes it.\nHence, we can boldly conclude that whether we like it or not, Bitcoin has come to stay and Africans and African government will have no choice than just to embrace it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "overstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "expedia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:52:16.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fdab817661e98afdc80430b1926d63d9f267739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU2uapf.UoFXA0zoyOP4PMY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Should I buy Bitcoin now or wait a little", "title_full": "Should I buy Bitcoin now or wait a little", "published": "2018-05-11T18:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.142, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fdab817661e98afdc80430b1926d63d9f267739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU2uapf.UoFXA0zoyOP4PMY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mayukus4life", "published": "2018-05-11T18:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should I buy Bitcoin now or wait a little", "text": "Bitcoin has gone down below $9,000 as we speak, so I believe it will be a good buy and with its current market trend it will appreciate in no distant time, It also depends if you are buying for long/short term hodl .

All over the world miners have set up operations, big and small, as they look to capitalize on dwindling Bitcoin rewards from processing transactions and validating the blockchain.\nWith plenty at stake, the costs of setting up even a small operation can be hefty, from the actual hardware to cooling systems and electricity consumption. However, those with enough capital to buy the best hardware, namely ASIC miners , put themselves in a commanding position.\nBut that also makes them a target for criminals. Whether these crooks want to hack your system and steal your valuable cryptocurrency or make off with your physical hardware, the potential dangers are real.\nThe latter scenario grabbed headlines this month, as over 600 computers used to mine Bitcoin have been seized in China, valued at over $2 mln alone. From Iceland to China?\nThe seized equipment is being linked to a series of thefts in Iceland late last year. Three separate incidents spanning from December to January led to a total of 600 computers being stolen by a number of culprits.\nThe Associated Press reported that eleven people were initially arrested , while two men were kept in custody for the burglaries — one of which took place in January at a data center that was housing computers used for Bitcoin mining.\nIcelandic IT firm Advania produced surveillance footage of thieves stealing computers from a data center in Reykjanesbær in January, which positively identified the two men that were in custody, according to local news outlet Visir .\nIn April, one of the culprits managed to escape from custody and fled to Sweden using a fake passport to board a flight to Stockholm. Sindri Þór Stefánsson later said he would return to Iceland in a statement. He claimed he had the right to travel at the time since his custody ruling had expired on April 16.\nTo date, Icelandic authorities have been unable to trace the stolen equipment. Police had asked IT service providers, electricians, and storage units in the country to report any unusual spikes in power use in the hopes they could track down the stolen mining computers.\nTwo months later, Chinese police seized 600 computers in Tianjin in what seems to be more than just a crazy coincidence. The operation caught the attention of Tianjin police after the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage at the location where the equipment was being operated.\nGiven that the number of computers is exactly the same, there’s a good possibility they could be the PCs from Iceland. Icelandic police have reached out to Chinese authorities to try and link the two cases. Still need to be connected\nIcelandic authorities are still waiting on their Chinese counterparts to respond to their requests for collaboration. If and when they do, it shouldn’t be difficult to link the computer equipment at the very least. Given that the computers were stolen from Advania’s data center, it’s almost certain that the serial numbers of components will be available.\nThis could then be cross-checked with the computers seized in Tianjin to positively link the hardware. While the owners of the hardware will no doubt be pleased to recover their property, the investigation has the potential to uncover a nefarious crime syndicate.\nIcelandic police commissioner Olafur Helgi Kjartansson was quoted saying, “This is a grand theft on a scale unseen before,” adding that it was a “highly organized crime”. With numerous suspects being investigated in both China and Iceland, authorities have the chance to apprehend criminals that are preying on the cryptocurrency community.

Such actions in the past had reportedly affected global prices several times since November.\nAs of press time Friday, Bitcoin had lost around $800, or 8.5 percent, in the past 24 hours, hitting the lowest price the coin has seen since April 20 .\nAcross altcoin markets, Ethereum (ETH) posted near 12 percent losses , while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fared worse, both losing about 17 percent over the same period.\nMarket visualization from Coin360\nWhile some local sources took to social media to suggest the price dip was an “overreaction” on the part of cryptocurrency holders, the episode is a test for Korean exchanges, which only recently returned to the listings of popular price tracker resource CoinMarketCap .\nPreviously, the major crypto price tracker had removed key South Korean exchanges from its price average computations over what it described as an “extreme divergence” between prices listed there and on exchanges in other countries.

In a recent interview , the former Facebook executive said Buffett is not an expert on technology. He also reiterated the notion that Bitcoin is digital gold. Buffett Knows Little About Technology\nSpeaking during the interview, Palihapitiya said Buffett, the 82-year Berkshire Hathaway CEO, isn’t entirely tech-savvy. According to Palihapitiya, knowledge of technology isn’t exactly in Buffett’s “circle of competence,” saying:\nNot everybody is right all the time.\nIndeed, Warren Buffett hasn’t always been right. Despite being regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, Buffett has passed up on a few choice investments like Amazon and Google . With cryptocurrency, he remains a staunch critic, recently declaring that buying the crypto wasn’t investing but speculating. Chamath Palihapitiya\nThe “Oracle of Omaha” has had a lot of negative things to say about cryptocurrency, calling it a bubble and a mirage. He has even called the number one crypto “rat poison,” a view shared by Charles Munger, Buffett’s second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger recently referred to the granddaddy of cryptocurrency as a “ noxious poison ” and called for the U.S. to adopt China’s crypto crackdown philosophy. According to Buffett, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and does not produce anything.\nPalihapitiya isn’t the only one who thinks Buffett knows nothing about technology and cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said earlier in the year that the Berkshire Hathaway chief doesn’t understand bitcoin . Recently, Weiss Ratings provided evidence to dispute Buffett’s claims that the number one virtual currency has no value. Bitcoin is a Replacement for Gold\nPalihapitiya believes Bitcoin is a replacement for gold. The self-proclaimed Buffett disciple identifies with the importance of the cryptocurrency, saying that it bears no correlation with the mainstream market. As a result, it appears like Bitcoin has created a separate world, one that Palihapitiya jokes requires a passport to move from one to the other.\nThe former Facebook executive has owned Bitcoin since 2012. He says that he prefers to view the cryptocurrency as a hedge to the uncertainty of the mainstream market. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, an event that Palihapitiya says broke the confidence of many people in the safety of mainstream finance. As a final thought, Palihapitiya states:\nEverything broke down, and things that we thought were hedges went away.\nDo you think Palihapitiya is correct in saying Warren Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin?

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night’s move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night’s drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.\nSometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn’t rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn’t just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View\nSummary:\n1. A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours.\n2. This move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend\n3. The sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Perhaps there could be a managed fund offered out there by a big investment banking firm in the future that bundles up bitcoin investments, sure, but it's hard to see an entire company dedicate all of their resources to bitcoin trading alone.\nIf you consider exchanges something of a company that puts their sole focus on bitcoin trading, then that could work out. However, I don't think that's what you mean.\nIn the future as we see more institutional investors coming in, I believe that we'll see established investment firms start to expand their business towards bitcoin as well.

I am a crypto-currency miner and investor with over 4 years of experience in crypto trading and blockchain technologies. I specialize in high-potential alt-coins. Currently, I am looking to sell some of my alt-coins (NEO, REP and LSK). I am in possession of a relatively large volumes (over 75 000 USD combined worth) and looking for small, medium and large scale buyers. I will be glad to trade with novice and professionals alike. I would exchange only at the current official rate for the given currencies (or average for the day depending on the method of payment) (Do not trust traders who offer to trade at up to 30-50% lower than the official exchange rate, those are most likely scammers!). The current official exchange rate for the alt-coins I am trading as well as charts and information can be found at: [Due to posting policies I cannot post links to websites. However the rates and charts for NEO, REP and LSK can be found easily with a simple Google search. Or just contact me.] As methods of payment I accept: CASH (GBP, USD, CAD, EUR) - A meeting at a public location in the area of Central London from Friday to Monday 10 AM to 4 PM. Only for trades of 500£ or more or equivalent of accepted currencies. All the effort is not worth it for me for less, sorry. BANK TRANSFER (GBP) - Bank Transfer to a UK Bank account. All bank charges to be covered by the buyer. For trades of 2000£ or more. BITCOIN (BTC) - Direct or Escrow bitcoin transfer. Mining fees and Escrow charges to be paid by the buyer. For trades of 75£ or more. I no longer accept PayPal due to people trying to pay with stolen credentials and my funds getting blocked. Be responsible with crypto-currency and if you are looking for a PayPal transfer look elsewhere, sorry. IMPORTANT NOTE: I am a serious seller and I expect serious buyers. The rules are as follows: Please do not contact me if you are under the age of 18. Please do not contact me for general crypto-currency questions that can be answered with a simple Google search. Please do not contact me for offers of partnerships, exchanges for currency not mentioned in the listing or anything unrelated to the listing. Please do respect me and have in mind that I have a life and a family and do 30 trades a day on average and I cannot respond to everyone instantly.

Now, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), could start offering Bitcoin futures to its clients. Bitcoin Futures in Wall Street\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies have proven to be a great investment option for some risky investors. Indeed, during the last years, people have made important returns when buying Bitcoin.\nAccording to The New York Times , there is a possibility that the ICE could launch Bitcoin trading options. If that turns out to be correct, the ICE would become the second Wall Street company that decides to offer Bitcoin investments after Goldman Sachs.\nThe report reads as follows:\n“[The ICE] has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day – with the backing and security of the exchange.”\nInvestors are ready to place their investments in this new volatile market. At the moment, it is highly unregulated, but it could change in the coming months before the end of the year. As mentioned before at CoinStaker, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), will be presenting its work on crypto regulations. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet Against Bitcoin\nTwo important figures in the technological and business fields, have given their opinion about bitcoin and virtual currencies in general. Both of them are opposed to Bitcoin and what it can provide to the society, but they remark the good points of blockchain technology.\nBill Gates said that he would be shorting bitcoin right now if he would be able to do so.\n“As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up. It’s kind of a pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment. I agree I would short it if there was an easy way to do it.”\nAt the same time, Warren Buffet said that Bitcoin was ‘probably rat poison squared.’ He has also commented that it and other virtual currencies could end very bad.\nBitcoin is the most important virtual currency in the market. Some critics to it referred to the high fees and scalability issues that couldn’t be addressed and the argue between Bitcoin Cash supporters and Bitcoin developers. The reality is that Bitcoin will soon be able to scale with the Lightning Network (LN), meaning that it would be able to process millions of transactions per second with almost no fees.\nJoin the conversation over at Telegram ( https://t.me/coinstaker )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html", "https://t.me/coinstaker", "http://cryptstorm.com/2018/05/07/microsoft-announces-new-azure-blockchain-tools-for-developers/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T00:24:52.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3d619e98e4f801039b380a22d59787b1ca23052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfGHXXGPPZagZRz0.nUzRtfF7FjfAXFwA0sDkqEbgokQB5gDeyXFZARI-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bitcoin Loses $9K Support As Markets React To S.

Such actions in the past had reportedly affected global prices several times since November.\nAs of press time Friday, Bitcoin had lost around $800, or 8.5 percent, in the past 24 hours, hitting the lowest price the coin has seen since April 20.\nAcross altcoin markets, Ethereum (ETH) posted near 12 percent losses, while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fared worse, both losing about 17 percent over the same period.\nMarket visualization from Coin360\nWhile some local sources took to social media to suggest the price dip was an “overreaction” on the part of cryptocurrency holders, the episode is a test for Korean exchanges, which only recently returned to the listings of popular price tracker resource CoinMarketCap.\nPreviously, the major crypto price tracker had removed key South Korean exchanges from its price average computations over what it described as an “extreme divergence” between prices listed there and on exchanges in other countries.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial supervisory commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:28:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "211561306262b64f0e0152fc1b8bcf70a35a0099", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YksORWE6_vIY7Pr7LiOeIPGOgVVkFyZg17GcOzemECx5zvdzxjDqKYmSFrvcHK4qsUysjdzG5534ykxqBsdUTCfE-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

In a recent interview , the former Facebook executive said Buffett is not an expert on technology. He also reiterated the notion that Bitcoin is digital gold. Buffett Knows Little About Technology\nSpeaking during the interview, Palihapitiya said Buffett, the 82-year Berkshire Hathaway CEO, isn’t entirely tech-savvy. According to Palihapitiya, knowledge of technology isn’t exactly in Buffett’s “circle of competence,” saying:\nNot everybody is right all the time.\nIndeed, Warren Buffett hasn’t always been right. Despite being regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, Buffett has passed up on a few choice investments like Amazon and Google . With cryptocurrency, he remains a staunch critic, recently declaring that buying the crypto wasn’t investing but speculating. Chamath Palihapitiya\nThe “Oracle of Omaha” has had a lot of negative things to say about cryptocurrency, calling it a bubble and a mirage. He has even called the number one crypto “rat poison,” a view shared by Charles Munger, Buffett’s second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger recently referred to the granddaddy of cryptocurrency as a “ noxious poison ” and called for the U.S. to adopt China’s crypto crackdown philosophy. According to Buffett, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and does not produce anything.\nPalihapitiya isn’t the only one who thinks Buffett knows nothing about technology and cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said earlier in the year that the Berkshire Hathaway chief doesn’t understand bitcoin . Recently, Weiss Ratings provided evidence to dispute Buffett’s claims that the number one virtual currency has no value. Bitcoin is a Replacement for Gold\nPalihapitiya believes Bitcoin is a replacement for gold. The self-proclaimed Buffett disciple identifies with the importance of the cryptocurrency, saying that it bears no correlation with the mainstream market. As a result, it appears like Bitcoin has created a separate world, one that Palihapitiya jokes requires a passport to move from one to the other.\nThe former Facebook executive has owned Bitcoin since 2012. He says that he prefers to view the cryptocurrency as a hedge to the uncertainty of the mainstream market. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, an event that Palihapitiya says broke the confidence of many people in the safety of mainstream finance. As a final thought, Palihapitiya states:\nEverything broke down, and things that we thought were hedges went away.\nDo you think Palihapitiya is correct in saying Warren Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin?

Gox trustee, who was tasked to sell about 200 000 bitcoin after the bankruptcy of the exchange Mt. Gox, is suspected to have dumped another 8 000 bitcoin on the cryptocurrency market.\nT he Mt. Gox trustee has sold bitcoin and bitcoin cash worth more than $400 million since September last year till March this year. At the end of April this year Mt. Gox Trustee Wallet sent out 16 000 BTC .\nToday, on May 11, four wallets of the Mt. Gox trustee moved around 2 000 bitcoins each, sending over 8 000 bitcoins in total over the past 24 hours. Considering that Nobuaki Kobayashi was asked to sell over 200 000 bitcoins and convert it to Japanese yen by local financial authorities, it is evident that any external movement of the Mt. Gox trustee’s funds likely means that they are being sold on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThough the Mt. Gox trustee could use the over-the-counter (OTC) market and directly deal with large-scale investors that are willing to purchase thousands of bitcoins, he has opted to sell its funds on cryptocurrency exchanges, leading the cryptocurrency market to drop by large margins.\nAnother reason for today’s cryptocurrency market decline is the news that the crypto exchange Upbit is suspected of fraud .

Representatives of IBM, European Parliament and a large Swiss company PwC Legal will participate in the event.\nThis year, the regulation of digital currencies and blockchain tech has become the central topic for the discussions in the crypto community. Experts have heralded 2018 as a year of regulations. That is why the conference in Prague will mainly feature the legislative aspect.\nDimitrios Psarrakis, capital markets and fintech regulation policy advisor at the European Parliament, will discuss how authorities approach regulation. Mr. Psarraks will dedicate a presentation to the approaches towards the regulation of cryptocurrencies that would contribute to the industry development. He will focus on the view of the Parliament, central banks and judicial system on the legal status of digital assets.\nGuenther Dobrauz , partner at PwC Legal Switzerland, will also speak about cryptocurrency regulation. His presentation will touch upon such issues as “Will cryptocurrency substitute fiat?” and “Cryptocurrencies and the banking system: hype or real changes?”.\nDominik Stroukal , a renowned Czech blockchain expert (co-founder at Bit Agency and chief economist at Roklen), will dwell on the basic principles of decentralized technologies. In his presentation titled “Whose blockchain is it anyway’” Mr. Stroukal will define “distributed register”, also noting its essential features and main challenges related to privacy.\nSandris Murins , co-founder at Germany-based company Iconiq Lab, will pique interest among investors by making a presentation dedicated to the results of the research on 200 tokens. He will show which services use the most valuable tokens, peculiarities of inflation and deflation in terms of digital assets and will also mention the future by featuring AI tokenization.\nRené Bostic , technical vice president of innovation and new technologies at IBM Cloud, will deliver “Blockchain lessons learned: hype or reality’?” He will focus on the research in the realm of blockchain and provide application areas of the technology.\nStefano Virgilli , CEO at VOX ICO Consulting and CSO at INVICTUS, will dedicate a presentation to mining. He will share how transaction cost is set and how to understand the complexity of hash rate calculating. Mr. Vergilli will also talk about the possibilities for the blockchain distribution beyond the financial sphere.\nRepresentatives of CA Technologies, Adel, GRAFT Blockchain, Crowdholding and other companieswill also make presentations at the conference.\nFind a detailed program here .

The top digital token broke its streak Friday after South Korean prosecutors raided the offices of Upbit, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, renewing concerns that heightened regulatory scrutiny around the world could hurt business and dampen enthusiasm for digital assets. The top digital token declined as much as 6.4 percent to as low as $8,508 in New York trading, the lowest level in three weeks, according to Bloomberg data. There was also speculation that the trustee of failed exchange Mt. Gox was selling its Bitcoin to pay back creditors. Bitcoin’s drop is part of a broader selloff in the cryptocurrency market, which is currently worth around $380 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com. That’s almost $100 billion less than it was worth a week ago.

You might think mainstream support for the highly speculative digital asset would give bitcoin and its crypto cousins a boost, as it helps unlock demand from much bigger investors.\nHowever, the crypto market seems unimpressed. Bitcoin prices are down this month.\nThis is despite a New York Times report that Goldman Sachs will post bids and offers for bitcoin futures, and is looking into ways to trade actual crypto tokens. A few days later, the newspaper reported that Intercontinental Exchange—the owner of the New York Stock Exchange—is discussing a type of bitcoin swap for institutional investors.\nThese derivatives could help open the door for large investors to get exposure to digital tokens, as there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about how crypto will be regulated. But futures and swaps can allow traders to bet on just about any asset’s price and, importantly, they fall under existing regulations administered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nOther financial firms are also looking at ways to build scaffolding around the crypto market. Bloomberg, which runs the most popular data and messaging platform for Wall Street traders, said recently that it’s launching an index for the largest, most liquid crypto assets.

This might sound like a scene in the next Bourne movie, but it has become reality.\nA startup called Xapo is storing $10 billion worth of bitcoin in a network of underground bunkers on five continents on behalf of clients including family offices, Bloomberg reports . Newsletter Sign-up\nThe company is the brainchild of Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, aka “Patient Zero,” known for tirelessly promoting bitcoin as an investment to Silicon Valley’s affluent.\nBloomberg came up with the $10 billion figure thanks to two anonymous Xapo clients. An anonymous source close to the operation described the number as an accurate approximation.\nAt about 7% of the worldwide bitcoin supply, that’s not crypto chump change. It means that four-year-old Xapo has more “deposits” than 98% of U.S. banks, according to Bloomberg.\nXapo’s Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the Financial Services Standards Association, a self-regulatory organization that ensures that its members comply with anti-money-laundering rules. The company serves its U.S. clientele through a Delaware corporation that is registered with Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nIt may be worth familiarizing yourself with Xapo--a wealthy client may very well ask you to store some bitcoin with it.\n–Ross Snel", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://sts3.wsj.net/barrons/banners/bh-openhouse.html", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin?mod=article_inline"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T11:09:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36c2409b2b1b3aa72af0acb6817faa061a9f0057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSR9rCJWoctXIKwNusSQ1FmbjN1i33fBE4DjoLXLWMOrPnHEd_6u3WHji6PSyX4lTtJvhZN2SO7HD", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "You Don’t Understand Bitcoin Because You Think Money Is Real", "title_full": "You Don’t Understand Bitcoin Because You Think Money Is Real", "published": "2018-05-11T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36c2409b2b1b3aa72af0acb6817faa061a9f0057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSR9rCJWoctXIKwNusSQ1FmbjN1i33fBE4DjoLXLWMOrPnHEd_6u3WHji6PSyX4lTtJvhZN2SO7HD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "You Don’t Understand Bitcoin Because You Think Money Is Real", "text": "You Don't Understand Bitcoin Because You Think Money Is Real\n/u/Jumpingcords\nsubmitted by /u/Jumpingcords\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:01:47.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03c3b44ff6618bb089b9a940a5426c7c6fbea646", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniDDNegqQkIUMgSmCyTePw0b05T.Wk5qTUDP5zZxCJZ7abaGcPN9v764FApjm0WvUNIEgixErR8Fp91qrzvWMXIRUZpNl7vaOL7kc0KJKQckIp7r.DoGPC2Zm_MiOI_sV0Q--", "site_full": "www.firstorderhistorians.com", "site": "firstorderhistorians.com", "site_section": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "South Korea: crypto-stock exchange Upbit of authorities searched – Bitcoin price falls", "title_full": "South Korea: crypto-stock exchange Upbit of authorities searched – Bitcoin price falls", "published": "2018-05-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/a2995af977d55411ddf88419678b5640.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03c3b44ff6618bb089b9a940a5426c7c6fbea646", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniDDNegqQkIUMgSmCyTePw0b05T.Wk5qTUDP5zZxCJZ7abaGcPN9v764FApjm0WvUNIEgixErR8Fp91qrzvWMXIRUZpNl7vaOL7kc0KJKQckIp7r.DoGPC2Zm_MiOI_sV0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top News", "published": "2018-05-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Korea: crypto-stock exchange Upbit of authorities searched – Bitcoin price falls", "text": "Bitcoin, Crypto currency, Blockchain South Korea: crypto-stock exchange Upbit of authorities searched – Bitcoin price falls\nThe largest crypto stock exchange Upbit was investigated by the police and ten Investigators.

The price of Bitcoin is back on the vary, many wait eagerly after the well-deserved Rally after since January, the ongoing correction phase. In this time of waiting a message from South Korea, which creates uncertainty now comes once again. Local media reported that a search of the exchange Upbit took place there, which is suspected of, to have their Numbers spoofed.\nThe Headquarters of Upbit was, therefore, of 10 investigators searched. Accordingly, were seized in the Headquarters of the crypto-stock exchange in Seoul, all the computers of the company, to verify the data. The suspicion is that the stock market claimed, among other things, to not have crypto-currencies, which were not actually present and to generate profits. All FUD? Upbit, South Korea, and the price of Bitcoin\nThe negative headlines from South Korea, correlate usually with a kink in the Bitcoin price. In January, the South Korean government announced far-reaching Regulatory initiatives. In addition, they introduced a System to verify the authenticity of the name. Meanwhile, the rate fell as we know, more than 50 per cent within two months, to meander slowly back to the top. Whether FUD or not, the Parallels are not dismissed out of Hand.\nWhat has, however, continue on the (In-)stability, is the rapprochement between the transactional and speculative demand. Because, as a study by the US-American Federal Reserve Bank showed, there is obviously an imbalance. While many people are using Bitcoin to speculate, the actual use as a means of payment at the moment. According to the study, the introduction of the Bitcoin Futures for the correction, therefore, is partly responsible. You should, however, also help to make the course a bit more stable.\nThe price of Bitcoin is currently at 7.380 euros and a total market capitalization of 6.7 billion euros. While the monthly growth is currently around 30 percent, he fell in the course of a day, to 6 per cent., and in the week to just under 9 percent. The scene is expected to break Through the 10,000-US-Dollar mark (about 8,000 euros), a psychologically important barrier.

According to Palihapitiya, knowledge of technology isn’t exactly in Buffett’s “circle of competence,” saying:\nNot everybody is right all the time.\nIndeed, Warren Buffett hasn’t always been right. Despite being regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, Buffett has passed up on a few choice investments like Amazon and Google . With cryptocurrency, he remains a staunch critic, recently declaring that buying the crypto wasn’t investing but speculating. Chamath Palihapitiya\nThe “Oracle of Omaha” has had a lot of negative things to say about cryptocurrency, calling it a bubble and a mirage. He has even called the number one crypto “rat poison,” a view shared by Charles Munger, Buffett’s second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger recently referred to the granddaddy of cryptocurrency as a “ noxious poison ” and called for the U.S. to adopt China’s crypto crackdown philosophy. According to Buffett, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and does not produce anything.\nPalihapitiya isn’t the only one who thinks Buffett knows nothing about technology and cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said earlier in the year that the Berkshire Hathaway chief doesn’t understand bitcoin . Recently, Weiss Ratings provided evidence to dispute Buffett’s claims that the number one virtual currency has no value. Bitcoin is a Replacement for Gold\nPalihapitiya believes Bitcoin is a replacement for gold. The self-proclaimed Buffett disciple identifies with the importance of the cryptocurrency, saying that it bears no correlation with the mainstream market. As a result, it appears like Bitcoin has created a separate world, one that Palihapitiya jokes requires a passport to move from one to the other.\nThe former Facebook executive has owned Bitcoin since 2012. He says that he prefers to view the cryptocurrency as a hedge to the uncertainty of the mainstream market. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, an event that Palihapitiya says broke the confidence of many people in the safety of mainstream finance. As a final thought, Palihapitiya states:\nEverything broke down, and things that we thought were hedges went away.\nDo you think Palihapitiya is correct in saying Warren Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin?

Given the semi-anonymous status of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, hackers are not only able to steal funds but also exchange them for fiat currency without getting noticed. This has led many reputable exchange platforms to invest in new and advanced security measures to offer enhanced protection to their users' funds.\nIf you are looking to invest in an exchange and are wondering how to start your own bitcoin exchange, gain insight into following tips to build a secure exchange.\nTwo-factor authentication\nTo improve the security of individual trading accounts, most exchanges use two-factor authentication (2FA) when their users log into their trading accounts. Two-factor authentication requires users (at the time of signing up to their accounts) to provide their user name and password, along with a confirmation code that is shared with them either via a text message or an automated voice call. Even if someone steals a user's login details, he or she would be unable to access a user's account since the confirmation code would still be required to log in.\nTime-locks\nAn innovative solution to secure bitcoin transactions, especially at the time of withdrawal, is to use time-locks which require two keys and a particular time frame to complete a bitcoin transaction. For example, one key is required to start a transaction and the second key to complete the transaction. If the second key is not used to confirm the transaction, the transaction is reversed, making it almost impossible for hackers to withdraw funds.\nMultisig\nWhile comprehending how to start your own bitcoin exchange , understand how multisig can work for your benefit. Multisig, short for multi-signature, requires more than one private key to authorize a bitcoin transaction. Many major exchanges embrace this technology to secure their users' wallets and provide an extra layer of security.\nKYC check\nSome bitcoin users prefer to trade on exchanges that do not require KYC verification because these users want to trade anonymously. However, the truth is that bitcoin exchanges that require identity checks offer a more secure platform to users for trading. If every individual involved in trading passes an exchange's KYC verification process, the risk of fraud is greatly reduced as people indulged in illegitimate trading can be easily recognized.\nCold storage\nCold storage can also be used to provide an extra layer of security while safeguarding users' funds. Cold storage refers to offline storage of bitcoins in a cold wallet. It is useful for those who trade bitcoins worth a large amount. As the coins are not stored online, it becomes nearly impossible for hackers to access users' funds.\nInsurance policies\nAnother way for an exchange to enhance its security is by purchasing an insurance policy that covers cyber attack and any loss from technical malfunctions. For example, local exchanges in Japan can buy dedicated bitcoin exchange insurance that covers against losses because of operational issues, cyber theft and embezzlement by employees.\nWith the increase in bitcoin trading volumes and exchanges handling more number of transactions daily, cyber security has become imperative. Many major exchanges are adopting advanced technologies to enhance their security and provide their users with a platform that allows secure, fast and uninterrupted trading.\nWhile you seek advice on how to create your own bitcoin exchange , make sure to focus on these tips to build a highly-secure exchange platform. This will help build potential investors' interest in your exchange. In addition, emphasize on making your platform user-friendly so it is easy-to-understand by your target audience.

The $9,000 level is major support extending down to $8,800. If we break down below the $8,800, then I think we can unwind. Otherwise, we are going to continue to go back and forth between 9,000 and 10,000 eventually breaking above 10,000.\nBitcoin/JPY — Bitcoin has tested the 1 million yen level, we are basically right in the middle of this consolidation area. So, that makes sense why the market is going to continue to dance around if we can break above 1.25 million yen, then the market is ready to go much higher. Otherwise, if we can break down below 900,000, then we will probably drift down to 700,000.

Let’s breakdown what we know about these bitcoin newcomers. Goldman Sachs to trade bitcoin instruments Goldman Sachs was the first major financial institution to initiate coverage of bitcoin markets when analyst Sheba Jafari issued the first Goldman bitcoin market report in June 2017. Goldman Sachs continues to offer regular reports on bitcoin with price predictions. As a matter of fact, in a report issued for the week of May 7, 2018, Jafari is notably bearish on bitcoin, advising that price is in “jeopardy of returning to its Feb low of $5,922.” However, that bearish outlook isn’t enough to dissuade Goldman Sachs from offering bitcoin trading to its customers. For now, the firm will not directly own bitcoin, although it may later do so with regulatory approval. Instead, the company will trade bitcoin futures contracts with institutional money on behalf of its customers. The company recently hired Justin Schmidt for the role of “head of digital asset markets” as it prepares to launch complex derivative products in the next few weeks. While this is certainly a positive step forward for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, the news hasn’t resulted in much positive price action. There are likely many reasons for this, but most probable explanation is that GS won’t actually be buying, selling or holding bitcoin. Instead, they will offer futures contracts and derivatives from which they will certainly profit, but the activity likely will not increase market demand for bitcoin. Still, their announcement stands as a milestone for crypto markets, but a transition to direct bitcoin purchasing would be seen as a much stronger market signal. For now, we must await their next move. New York Stock Exchange may offer bitcoin trading While hedge funds have been involved in bitcoin and crypto markets for several years, large regulated financial institutions have avoided buying and selling bitcoin. This could be set to change if ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange , opens its rumored trading desk. Retail investors have generally shunned cryptoassets, perhaps due to a lack of understanding of the legality and regulations surrounding bitcoin. However, the entry of a major player like NYSE could not only increase demand and open up potential markets to new investors, it would certainly improve the public’s perception of bitcoin and could further legitimize the cryptoasset markets. Some may remember that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading bitcoin futures in Q4 of 2017. But bitcoin itself cannot be purchased by CME and CBOE traders. The NYSE appears ready to change this. According to CCN, “Various reports revealed that ICE Exchange is not launching a futures market like CME and CBOE, rather a proper bitcoin exchange on which investors can buy, sell, and store bitcoin directly.” The New York Times reported that “The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times.” Although bitcoin can be easily purchased from licensed exchanges in many countries, many retail investors still question bitcoin’s legitimacy. The NYSE could change that by opening a trading desk. For now, the exchange plans are rumored but not confirmed. CNBC’s bitcoin analyst Brian Kelly expressed his surprise at the lackluster market response to the news by noting that the NYSE has cleared the biggest hurdle for institutional investors to hold bitcoin by developing a custody solution. “They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly. “That’s the big deal.” NASDAQ could follow NYSE lead, trade crypto In late April, Nasdaq CEO toyed with crypto investors when revealing that the exchange could offer bitcoin and other cryptoassets for retail purchase and trading. According to Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, \"Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time. If we do look at it and say 'it's time, people are ready for a more regulated market ,' for something that provides a fair experience for investors.\" This according to a CNBC report covering the recently announced Nasdaq collaboration with the bitcoin exchange Gemini. The report goes on to say that regulation and clarification of the exact financial status of bitcoin and other coins is key to adoption by institutional investors. An offering of bitcoin and other cryptos on the more tech company focused Nasdaq exchange would likely be more impactful than a NYSE listing. There are operational differences in how the two exchanges work , as well. Trading on the NYSE involves two parties participating in a live auction style with buying and selling prices determined on the fly by the traders. The Nasdaq on the other hand relies on market makers to provide liquidity. Regardless of the exact method of trading, a bitcoin listing on Nasdaq would likely be a huge boost for the crypto markets. Jane Street Capital already offers bitcoin to investors Meanwhile, a private investment company has reportedly been trading bitcoin for some time. Jane Street Capital, a closely guarded high volume investment trading company, revealed to the media that the company “trades over 56,000 products globally across a wide variety of asset classes, including bitcoin.” The company declined to reveal any further details. Jane Street trades over $5 trillion in annual volume and offers sophisticated proprietary software trading algorithms to its traders. It isn’t much of a jump to conclude that other private investment firms are also likely offering some forms of virtual currency trading to customers. With the fresh news from NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges, along with Goldman Sachs announcement and the CME/CBOE futures trading, one has to wonder how much longer institutions will be able to stay out of the bitcoin and crypto markets. Grayscale crypto funds continue to roll out Grayscale Investments has had its bitcoin investment trust (GBTC) available for OTC purchase since May 2015. Investors interested in purchasing bitcoin but unwilling or unable to do so directly through crypto exchanges can buy shares in GBTC via traditional brokerage houses or even within self-directed IRA’s. Earlier this year, Grayscale rolled out single coin funds for Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), zCash (ZEC), and Ripple (XRP). Those funds are open only to accredited investors for the first year before they can be more widely offered. This is set to occur in March 2019. Currently only US investors with a net worth of greater than $1 million or annual income of greater than $200,000 can purchase shares of these funds. Other countries vary in definition of an accredited investor. Grayscale has also created a multicurrency index fund, the Digital Large Cap fund, that will hold a basket of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It too remains open only for accredited investors at this point. Potential investors should keep in mind that these fund shares can trade at a premium to the underlying assets held, and most of the held coins can be purchased on licensed crypto exchanges with minimal effort. However, these crypto funds can be purchased within a tax-deferred retirement account, which may appeal to many investors. What’s next for bitcoin and institutional investors? If regulations are sorted out and storage issues can be addressed, institutions will likely adopt more crypto friendly trading policies, probably much to the chagrin of Jamie Dimon with his proclamation of firings for any employee caught trading bitcoin. He embarrassingly had to recant on that statement when his firm issued a supportive statement on the future of bitcoin . I suspect that many Wall Street institutional investors and mainstreet retail investors will gradually enter the bitcoin market over the course of Q3 and Q4 2018. Many of them will be compelled to do so in order to keep up with the competition already offering cryptocurrency to investors. In the meantime, expect crypto exchanges like Coinbase (and GDAX ), Poloniex (just purchased by Circle ), Bittrex , Gemini , Kraken , Binance and Bitstamp , and many, many others, to continue to streamline their user interfaces and update their apps to onboard customers at quicker pace to stay ahead of the competition. Indeed, Coinbase has added a large number of new empoyees and computing resources in expectation of future growth of the sector. Meanwhile, bitcoin newcomer Robinhood raised over $360 million to expand its cryptocurrency market presence. All of this should make for at least an interesting close to 2018 bitcoin prices, to say the least.

Huawei is leading the way in terms of adoption of blockchain technologies , and we’re excited to bring BTC.com to Huawei’s user base for the first time.”\nBTC.com allows users to safely store their private keys, granting them full control of their cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, BTC.com also offers a popular block explorer to browse the blockchain, check on pending transactions, and gather network statistics.\n“Cryptocurrencies have recently expanded the human understanding of digital economy at a large scale. From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.” – Dr. Jaime Gonzalo, VP of Huawei Mobile Services. “That is the reason why Huawei selected BTC.com as our recommended quality app to manage digital currencies. In addition to being simple and secure to use, BTC.com offers an exclusive reward to all AppGallery users by gifting a starting amount of cryptocurrency.”\nChina has far and away the largest smartphone market in the world with 717 million smartphone users (Newzoo’s 2017 Global Mobile Market Report), that’s well over triple the amount of smartphones in the US.
