In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL ALABAMA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nWhile gambling devices are banned by the state, and by default this would typically mean no casinos, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians legally operates three casinos in the state. Tribes have said they would like to get in on the sports betting bandwagon.\nOverall though, Alabama is seen as one of the least likely states to offer legalized sports betting at the onset. The very colleges that have made Alabama a juggernaut in the world of College Basketball are already expressing concern over the prospects of legalization, more so as it pertains to neighboring Mississippi likelihood of becoming one of the first states to offer sports wagering in the deep south.\nNeedless-to-say, Alabama gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poarch band of creek indians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweet home alabama", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T22:04:57.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aaed141e839c38b49336560e52ef99441a646346", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va79sKhEfvhFlaXULSSsjsCN21S2bCUwQeL_RxaWooT7q0EzEATK3AnoNaEkX2GGyb8GH8xmeWemhx", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "How Can I transfer bitcoin to an address?", "title_full": "How Can I transfer bitcoin to an address?", "published": "2018-06-01T20:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aaed141e839c38b49336560e52ef99441a646346", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va79sKhEfvhFlaXULSSsjsCN21S2bCUwQeL_RxaWooT7q0EzEATK3AnoNaEkX2GGyb8GH8xmeWemhx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LearningPal", "published": "2018-06-01T20:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Can I transfer bitcoin to an address?", "text": "We have started building a bitcoin exchange , we have integrated an API which creates an address which is assigned to a user, user can deposit a bitcoin to the address.

Initially, the service will only be available to people in the province of Salta.\nArgentina hinted about opening its doors to cryptocurrency last year when Lucas Llach, Vice President of the Central Bank of Argentina, reportedly said that the regulator is “not afraid of Bitcoin and likes some of its uses.”\nThe startup Bitex, a Bitcoin and Litecoin exchange, is not limited to Argentina.

They’re More Alike Than You Think", "text": "Today, people tend to view the world of blockchains as inhabited by two broad factions: One favors “permissionless” ledgers like Bitcoin, where anyone can join, while the other camp, backed by many in the business community, prefers a pre-approval, or “permissioned,” system. The two sides typically talk past each other and, frequently, regard the other with suspicion and resentment.\n“It's very divided,” says Amber Baldet , CEO and co-founder of Clovyr , a startup that’s creating a platform--not unlike Salesforce’s Heroku --for developers and businesses to build and manage decentralized apps across both public and enterprise blockchains.\nThe former blockchain leader at JPMorgan Chase visited Fortune’s studios to discuss the intra-industry, ideological clash on the latest episode of Balancing The Ledger , a new show about the intersection of finance and technology. (You can read more about Baldet in this month’s Fortune 500 issue of the magazine.)\nThis controversy is rooted in whether one of the most prized qualities of Bitcoin--its wide decentralization among unnamed users--should be inherent to all blockchains. While corporations favor permissioned blockchains so they can control who they do business with, critics argue that the centralized nature of such a system undermines the original purpose of the technology.\nIn Baldet’s view, part of the problem is rooted in the terminology. “I really think that nomenclature just isn't helpful,” Baldet says, referring to the commonplace partitioning of public versus enterprise blockchains. “It creates this kind of animosity where we're saying that big business is on one side and the people and the proletariat are on the other side.\n“Really, it should just be about information residing where it makes sense and creating security boundaries that are logical,” she says.\nGet The Ledger , Fortune's weekly newsletter on the intersection of finance and tech.\nRather than a black-and-white, public-vs.-enterprise scenario, consider a gradient of options. Imagine a setup where a variety of interconnected, cryptographically-sealed ledgers--a mix of permissioned and permisionless databases, depending on their purposes--interact. This arrangement could have advantages, creating separation between network layers and limiting the effect of potential security breaches.\n“If you have something that's going to infect an entire network, and you have a security boundary around that, well, if you're on the other side of that boundary, then you're potentially protected,” Baldet explains.\nIn other words, if a catastrophic vulnerability were found in a public blockchain protocol, then a business wouldn’t want that problem affecting its internal, mission-critical operations. And vice versa: Businesses might find it useful to keep fingerprints of its internal chains on a public blockchain so that it has an auditable record in the event that its network becomes compromised.\nBaldet is betting, through her business Clovyr, that these supposedly opposing realms of the blockchain universe will commingle. “Creating an ‘Internet of value’ that's a bunch of networks connected together--much like the Internet is a network of networks--it's just a lot more pragmatic,” Baldet says, meaning that the end state doesn’t have to be either-or. There’s room enough, in her philosophy, for both the cryptocurrency bulls, who favor public blockchains, and the business blockchain acolytes, who prefer permissioned systems, to cooperate.\n“It's not about being a maximalist on either side of the fence,” she says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2016/01/27/salesforce-heroku-enterprise/", "http://fortune.com/40-under-40/amber-baldet-31/", "http://fortune.com/fortune500/jpmorgan-chase/", "http://fortune.com/tag/balancing-the-ledger/", "https://pages.email.fortune.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=THE_LEDGER&source=article", "http://fortune.com/2018/05/14/blockchain-jpmorgan-chase-amber-baldet-clovyr/", "http://fortune.com/longform/jpmorgan-chase-tech-blockchain/", "http://fortune.com/2018/06/01/blockchain-bitcoin-amber-baldet/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clovyr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salesforce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baldet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T04:10:34.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b0e872cf0eb16f297f3d54cca946260e0a49d49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfL4an5.BDcxsnCe6.pMp.Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=223.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Exchanges", "title": "Uquid bitcoin debit card reviews", "title_full": "Uquid bitcoin debit card reviews", "published": "2018-06-01T19:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b0e872cf0eb16f297f3d54cca946260e0a49d49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfL4an5.BDcxsnCe6.pMp.Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VRMdude", "published": "2018-06-01T19:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Uquid bitcoin debit card reviews", "text": "Quote: from: imrule on January 11, 2018, 08:55:21 AM Quote: from: NerONLY on December 29, 2017, 08:14:09 PM Quote: from: imrule on December 28, 2017, 04:02:07 PM Quote: from: Addisonbt on December 28, 2017, 12:29:29 PM monthly card fees, pls\nMonthly Card fees is just 1$.\nUpdate, I was able to load my card into my account.

I purchased my card on Dec 5th 2017 and I activated my card on Dec 23th.\nIt is possible that they have put you in queue to prep and ship out your card. Keep in mind, they had to send a card to everyone that previously had one before their service went down back in July (that is including myself).\nI have to admit, their rates are shitty but just recently 5 companies (Bitwala, Cryptopay, Wirex, ShakePay and TenX) went down because of Visa's policy change.\nUQUID is the only one left standing right now that's providing service to countries that are also outside of EU.\nI would have to give them some credit for switching to another card issuing company before the shit hit the fan.\nI'm not saying UQUID is perfect, but to me it's better than having nothing.\nTotally!\nWas a few weeks behind you and got caught up in the mastercard withdrawal stop even got a physical card delivered but never been able to use it and it cost £29 fee to purchase.

If you ever need to look up a transaction, this is how you would do it, by reading from the blockchain.\nTechnically the blockchain contains blocks of transactions that are linked together and timestamped. A new block is added to the blockchain every ten minutes or so. Keep in mind that many blockchains exist, right now we're only talking about Bitcoin's blockchain.\nThe source code\nWhen people talk about the Bitcoin source code, they're most likely talking about the implementation called Bitcoin Core, over on Github. It's important to know where to find this code, because even if we're not software engineers ourselves, we can still see if anyone is working on the project and when the last release was. The more software engineers that are working on an open source project, the better. Many other cryptocurrency projects live on Github as well.\nCurrency statistics\nIf you wanted to know how many Bitcoin are in circulation as of right now, or what the price of Bitcoin is today, then we need to look at currency statistics. Some of the data is harvested from the network itself, and the rest of it, such as the price in USD comes from exchanges and exchange aggregators .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp", "https://blockchain.info/charts/difficulty", "https://blockchain.info/charts/miners-revenue", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250114578", "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce", "https://www.bitcoinmining.com/", "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin", "https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-ltc.html#3m", "https://shop.bitmain.com/antminer_s9_asic_bitcoin_miner.htm", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/", "https://blockchain.info/", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp", "https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size", "https://blockchain.info/block/0000000000000000003a29065af4314d8ea2299c091c61bf3045f9f7da24d85e", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://bitcoinfees.info/", "https://bitinfocharts.com/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object", "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/031703.asp", "https://blockchain.info/charts/n-unique-addresses", "https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&scale=1", "https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all", "https://github.com/", "https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/27/meet-the-newest-cryptocurrency-trend-coin-burn.aspx", "https://medium.com/all-things-ledger/decoding-the-enigma-of-bitcoin-mining-f8b2697bc4e2", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/bitcoin-mining-equipment-maker-canaan-files-for-1-billion-ipo", "https://coin.dance/stats", "https://coincap.io/", "https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html", "https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions", "https://coinmarketcap.com/faq/", "https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook", "https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate", "https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins", "http://www.kazabyte.com/2011/12/we-dont-understand-exponential-functions.html", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statement-analysis.asp", "https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,24h", "https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075VB7LVG", "http://fortune.com/2018/01/10/bitcoin-miners-electricity-argentina/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T18:59:02.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b0133670d517d92c5a4f1783d1471227ee36ae0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEwivSHkQB0eFvwDEqQY.M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Is NOW the best time to buy or enter in bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is NOW the best time to buy or enter in bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-01T19:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.322, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b0133670d517d92c5a4f1783d1471227ee36ae0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEwivSHkQB0eFvwDEqQY.M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "avirdoz", "published": "2018-06-01T19:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is NOW the best time to buy or enter in bitcoin?", "text": "The best time was a long time ago at the very beginning.

The existence of bitcoin up to date only proves that the financial industry could be better and can operate even without the banks.

Tracking the circulating supply, we note that the number is 18034313 16080114. Today’s volume is recorded at 20329.3.\nAbout Bitcoin Atom (BCA):No further information about the cryptocurrency is available at this time.\nInvestors might be trying to figure out how to best navigate the crypto market. With so much uncertainty and volatility, it may be extremely hard to figure out the proper play. The rise of Bitcoin has helped thrust cryptocurrency into the limelight. Although there are plenty of widespread opinions about the future of digital currency, it may be difficult to come to a definite conclusion with the current state of the market. As more information becomes available and research is conducted, the crypto market may become a little more demystified in the near future.\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors and consumers will most likely be evaluating the pros and cons. Although there are plenty of question marks with the current state of the market, there are many possible benefits of cryptocurrencies. Some of the possible benefits include the immediate access to liquidity, immediate availability, and the efficiency of transactions. The real-time access to funds combined with the speed of transaction time could be seen as a big benefit to consumers. Another positive benefit could be the lower transaction costs which would be a result of the elimination of the intermediary or third party.\nAlthough cryptocurrencies have been growing in popularity, it remains to be seen whether businesses will adopt them as generally accepted payments for goods and services. The element of trust may play a large role in the wide scale adoption of digital currency. Users will not only need to trust the technology behind the specific coin, but they will have to trust that other people will share the same level of trust and continue to accept the crypto as a legitimate form of payment. As more and more cryptocurrencies are introduced, consumers and investors will have to examine the underlying function. Unlike Bitcoin, there are many alternate coins that serve specialized purposes.

Source: CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Chart Why is Bitcoin price increasing?\nThere are various factors in play when it comes to the price increase of Bitcoin. The major factor being, the investor’s speculation around the price of Bitcoin. Another major support for the increase in the price of Bitcoin has been the Bitcoin’s use as a mode of payment for the mining fee. According to Bitcoin whitepaper, mining of Bitcoin is going to increase in complexity, which in turn would require higher computational power. To compensate miners for their resource miners are paid in Bitcoins. This economics of Bitcoin leads to a price increase.\nIn December 2017, the price of Bitcoin had reached its maximum value of $19,343 per bitcoin, giving some investors as much as 1000% gains. Since then the price of Bitcoin has fallen but has generally shown an upward trend, if the overall price trend has to be considered.\nThank you for reading this article.

The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you. Past results are no indication of future performance. Information contained this web site is intended for informational purposes only and was obtained from sources believed to be reliable.

Do you think this would have a large impact on society? Would this cause nocoiners to become the new low class? Would prices of every day goods rise? Would Fiat currency even be worth anything? Or would we just have a lot of new money in an otherwise unchanged society?\n(Hopefully) obviously, this post is purely hypothetical and in reference to John McAfee's prediction.\nIf that's happen then for sure a lot of millioners were born but I think the goods will stay on its price because bitcoin is not owned by the governments. Fiat will still have it's own value. Hopefully I am also holding some bitcoin when that's happen.\nApparently, those who are taking the advantage today and those who are really trying their best to at least hold up to a bitcoin. Generally, this is not something I think can ever happen in the mid 2020 as OP implied, but since he said IF, I guess the only thing that would happen is to see the space to have grown more than it is right now.

The new website Bitcoincashers.org plans to bring “everything Bitcoin Cash under one roof” showcasing the cryptocurrency as a fast and reliable payment method.\nAlso read: Brisbane International is Now the World’s First Crypto-Friendly Airport Bitcoincashers.org Aims to Help Consumers and Businesses Learn to Use Bitcoin Cash Anytime\nThe Bitcoin Cash Fund (BCF) wants to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and its new website Bitcoincashers.org plans to solidify this philosophy. The BCF organization explains that the new web portal aims to educate businesses and individuals worldwide, not only on how the cryptocurrency works, but the site will explain how people can use the decentralized asset every day.\nMoreover, BCF details that the website will also be a general resource for things like exchanges, meetups, and bounties. Bitcoincashers.org will feature a ‘For Merchants’ page that will focus on a resource for businesses, and the site will detail the very basics of using bitcoin like buying, earning, trading, and spending.\n“We’re excited that Bitcoincashers.org will assist consumers and businesses to use Bitcoin Cash anytime, anywhere,” says Paul Wasensteiner, board member of Bitcoin Cash Fund.\nBitcoin Cash is digital money that offers better features than traditional fiat cash. Vendors in places like Venezuela and other high-inflation environments are starting to use BCH to make payments without having to go through a third party such as a bank, government or payment service. A Closer Interaction With the Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem\nBitcoincashers.org will feature a vast resource section of Bitcoin Cash wallets alongside available Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems. BCF says the organization recognizes the need for an all-in-one swiss army knife website dedicated to Bitcoin Cash, and they believe BitcoinCashers.org will be an excellent vehicle towards on-ramping mass Bitcoin Cash adoption.\n“Bitcoincashers.org is going to be very important for those learning to navigate through the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem,” notes BCF during the website launch. “There are a ton of different projects, exchanges, and different ways to interact with BCH which can get confusing for even the seasoned Bitcoinercashers.\nThis website will bring all of these projects together in one place and will provide a chance to speed up the process of experiencing the community.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoincashers.org website?

Everybody has heard for sure some friends speaking about it or read news about blockchain revolutionary potential. The topics mostrly discussed are the highs and lows of crypto prices, the volatility of it, the mindblowing innovation and projects, the best places where buy cryptos or authority’s point of view on them. But here’s one of the most interesting topics, that sometimes is left unexplored: Who is actually accepting Bitcoin payments? This is a very good question which can give a more thoroughful perspective on how companies look at the crypto-world; and that can help everyone understanding the potential spread of the blockchain philosophy. In fact companies like Shopify, Subway, and Tesla have fully accepted Bitcoin payments, and you can pay for any of their products or services with them.

As we all know that all investment has its own risk and bitcoin is no exception for that. Somehow these smart people had already recovering their loss.

Today the price has been quite impulsive with the bearish after having a daily close with bullish engulfing candle yesterday. The market seems to be indecisive about the recent rumors about certain investigation going on for the Bitcoin transactions which scared off some market participants. Though there has been no news about big investors taking out their fund from the Bitcoin and Crypto market, so there are still chances for the bulls to dominate further in the coming days. As the price remains above $7,000 area, the bullish bias is expected to continue.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Robert Sluymer told CNBC’s Futures Now :\nWhen we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.\nSluymer’s statements come after the first and foremost cryptocurrency has found support at key support levels around the psychologically-significant level of $7,000 multiple times. In each instance, Bitcoin went on to recover — as it did earlier this week. Sluymer explained:\nThat’s certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold. Technical Indicators\nAdding to the belief that Bitcoin has bottomed out is the market leader’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period in an effort to measure speed and change of price movements. According to Sluymer, the RSI supports Fundstrat’s belief that Bitcoin is ready to rally. He stated:\nThat RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that’s really part of that bottoming phase taking hold.\nHowever, one should always exercise caution when following the advice of anyone analyzing the cryptocurrency market — which itself is prone to high levels of volatility and unregulated price manipulation . Because of this, there are some other indicators which may help confirm a reversal. Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy explained:\nThe next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it’s very simplistic, but it’s a pretty good proxy across most markets.\nThat 15-day moving average is roughly $7,800. Should Bitcoin manage to hold a level above said price, it is likely that buyers will enter the market with increased confidence. ‘The Setup is Very Attractive Here’\nIt has been over one week since Bitcoin last traded above $7,800, but Sluymer believes we’re currently in a prime buying opportunity. He told CNBC:\nWe think the setup is very attractive here. If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\nAt the time of this writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $7,591.31, up 0.32 percent over the last 24 hours.\nDo you think Bitcoin has bottomed? Do you agree with Fundstrat’s analysis that the market leader is already beginning to rally?

What coins do you think have a chance at replacing it and being adopted for use?\nI still do not think there will be a substitute for bitcoin, because bitcoin is the strongest coin and no other altcoin will replace bitcoin.\nThat is true, nothing could be better than coin which started this market, it will be king forever and it will lead market to green and moon for me in coming years untill its price will be more stable, cause i think that those Times will come in future.\nIts been more than 8 years that this world has seen the crypto currencies and that bitcoin was the first ever crypto coin presented to this world. Since that time, it is one and only bitcoin which is leading the crypto market in spite being the fact that there are so many other crypto coins in the crypto market as well but none of them has this much of the potential that it can compete with the bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:37:56.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aee78437c96586c8e66043e1100669cc124d76a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQIvQFkSk6yArQLifciF76qR4ywd8P3UsjJVSYETchD2nW2TJgbY2UWOesF.DhuQYC7K2WNFHAmQ2Md3RuVGXf6A--", "site_full": "www.bitcoin.name", "site": "bitcoin.name", "site_section": "http://www.bitcoin.name/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News", "title": "Trump’s New Trade Tariffs Could Kick Start Bitcoin", "title_full": "Trump’s New Trade Tariffs Could Kick Start Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-01T18:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aee78437c96586c8e66043e1100669cc124d76a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQIvQFkSk6yArQLifciF76qR4ywd8P3UsjJVSYETchD2nW2TJgbY2UWOesF.DhuQYC7K2WNFHAmQ2Md3RuVGXf6A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adminbtc", "published": "2018-06-01T18:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump’s New Trade Tariffs Could Kick Start Bitcoin", "text": "Leave a reply\nAs US president Donald Trump shocks the world with his surprise steel and aluminum tariffs targeted at Canadian, Mexican and EU markets, Bitcoin markets could be the beneficiary, according to Forbes. .\nThe response from Canada, the UK, France, and Mexico has been one of surprise and total indignation, pointing to the possibility of a trade crisis between the nations involved. These apparently punitive and protectionist measures could provide the much-awaited positive swing for Bitcoin, as it could become an ideal hedge opportunity as a result, providing that President Trump ‘s latest measures aren’t rescinded due to a global response against the US.\nTraders are now bracing themselves against the possibility of market volatility which will work very much in Bitcoin’s favor, as investors look for fundamentals to support the price of Bitcoin and positive indicators and motivators for change.\nThe recent Consensus 2018 event in New York was seen by some as the kind of shot in the arm needed to reinject enthusiasm in the sluggish Bitcoin market, but it proved to lack any real energy as a contributing driver to market despite offering headlines about Lamborghinis to news sources.\nThe last two months have seen numerous positive comments from central banks regarding some kind of CBDC. On both sides of the English Channel, politicians have waxed lyrical about cryptocurrency with even Canadian Bank of England Governor Mark Carney manufacturing a dramatic turnaround after his earlier view that Bitcoin had “failed”.\nChina with a cryptocurrency ban in place has now begun to take blockchain technology seriously, led by recent comments by Chinese president Xi Jinping, who now promotes the benefits of the new technology. Chinese investors welcome this, and reports indicate that it’s a question of time before the Bank of China follows suit. If the People’s Bank of China takes that route, it may impact on the way that Bitcoin and other currencies are regarded by the government, blockchain being the underlying technology behind digital currencies.\nCryptocurrency investors will be watching the development of what is already becoming a trade war between the US and its former trading partners with great interest, hoping that it could become another important factor in reinjecting energy into the Bitcoin market.\n Trump’s New Trade Tariffs Could Kick Start Bitcoin appeared 11", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://bitcoinnews.com/trumps-new-trade-tariffs-could-kick-start-bitcoin/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2018/05/31/us-trade-tariffs-would-support-bitcoin-end-of-may-brings-a-new-day/#4fbe0f8e2264", "https://bitcoinnews.com/iranians-look-to-bitcoin-after-trump-decision/", "https://bitcoinnews.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T20:02:11.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29b612214a8b1258687374d2981428f621c03741", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_G8gyN_WYMOwH8FSF9rUxM9oaPzEJ_agE0kc3sP9F0op17c2VOvbAdmG6fSqTfnsANBibaPIP8tkBkMekSGANAYIJ7P5.iZvlZLNzNxAkGBZpfOQZnZlD3TGomeCkI7ihXPzs3u64MxDtLvZCkjZuDqrlPo0JISPz4k8ZJdjf39WapmmsKk7D2", "site_full": "www.thehealthandwealthplace.com", "site": "thehealthandwealthplace.com", "site_section": "http://www.thehealthandwealthplace.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Health and Wealth Place", "title": "Blockchain Battles: EOS vs. Ethereum and Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash", "title_full": "Blockchain Battles: EOS vs. Ethereum and Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash", "published": "2018-06-01T18:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/healthwealthplace/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/01161142/maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29b612214a8b1258687374d2981428f621c03741", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_G8gyN_WYMOwH8FSF9rUxM9oaPzEJ_agE0kc3sP9F0op17c2VOvbAdmG6fSqTfnsANBibaPIP8tkBkMekSGANAYIJ7P5.iZvlZLNzNxAkGBZpfOQZnZlD3TGomeCkI7ihXPzs3u64MxDtLvZCkjZuDqrlPo0JISPz4k8ZJdjf39WapmmsKk7D2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T18:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockchain Battles: EOS vs. Ethereum and Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash", "text": "-ED- 1st June 2018 at 10:55 am\nSystem of voting based on how much stake (CAPITAL) you have, is the worth system for voting as it gives all the vote into small number of people who have the most wealth. This is what Capitalists system is based on also, and why the workers in a business who do all the work have no say in what the business they work in creates, how they work and where the profits go, and all of the vote (decision making) is in hands of capitalists… which is the prime reason why businesses exploit workers more and more as the business employs more and more people, and the capitalists exploit more percentage of wealth produced by the workers.\nPoS = Centralised system, always was and always will be because its a system that rewards those that have capital and fucks over those who don’t, it allows for small number of people to manipulate the vote because they have the most stake, which will always result in these people doing things that favor them, and is the prime reason why Capitalist economic system always creates more wealth inequality and divides people into class citizens based on how much money they have, and the little guy always get fucked over.

This is by far the most out of any online Bitcoin wallet service; Coinbase, a major Bitcoin exchange based in the United States, has 13 million in comparison.\nThe Blockchain.info wallet service can easily be used on any computer or phone, and can be secured with a pin code and 2-FA to ensure Bitcoins won’t be stolen. It is seen as a good lightweight option since a wallet can be created, secured, and used in minutes, as opposed to Bitcoin Core which can be time-consuming as it requires downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain.\nSerious Bitcoin users, however, will still prefer offline wallets that let users control their own private keys and that are not at risk of an online wallet’s server being hacked or shut down without warning. Full clients like Bitcoin Core also allows users to act as nodes that help secure the Bitcoin network.\nOf Bitcoin wallets created, there are currently only 22,057,779 Bitcoin addresses with a positive balance and 20,812,887 unique Bitcoin wallets with a positive balance , accounting for multiple addresses in a Bitcoin wallet. This means that many millions of wallets on the Blockchain.info service are empty, considering that there are lots of other Bitcoin wallet providers and programs included in this count of positive balances. Such a large amount of wallets with zero balance is due to people abandoning wallets. Often, people just use a wallet once and forget about it – this is also the recommended usage of addresses to protect privacy.\nBlockchain.info was founded in the United Kingdom and was launched in August 2011 , and has been one of the biggest Bitcoin websites ever since with an Alexa rank of 860 out of all the websites in the world. It provides wallet services, a block explorer, Bitcoin network statistics such as transaction volume and hash power, and an integrated Bitcoin exchange service. Apparently, Blockchain.info provided a mechanism for buying and selling Bitcoin in the United Kingdom since near its inception but has only recently begun exchange services for United States customers . This puts Blockchain.info in direct competition with Coinbase.\nThere have been positive developments for Blockchain.info, such as over USD 70 million of funding raised in recent years. It also hired Peter Wilson from Facebook and Google as VP of engineering, Breanne Madigan from Goldman Sachs as head of institutional sales, and Garrick Hileman from Bank of America and Allianz as head of research.\nWith its popularity, reputation, experience, and funding, it is likely that Blockchain.info will continue to grow in the long term and continue to be a leading online Bitcoin wallet service provider.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://www.ccn.com/crypto-startup-blockchain-hits-25-million-wallets/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.info", "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-company-blockchain-hits-25-million-crypto-wallets-110011639.html", "https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T20:01:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b827a10ae75761789f0e348457607de67934ae86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1a6Jm1VIuDbvohH1e7oHMpnS5_zyN5Er.E54c2hq9zdWzHkIFmvwVuq", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6476", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "ETF Trends", "title": "A Decent Grade for Bitcoin", "title_full": "A Decent Grade for Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-01T18:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b827a10ae75761789f0e348457607de67934ae86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1a6Jm1VIuDbvohH1e7oHMpnS5_zyN5Er.E54c2hq9zdWzHkIFmvwVuq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T18:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Decent Grade for Bitcoin", "text": " 10 AM EDT A Decent Grade for Bitcoin Weiss Ratings, an independent ratings agency, started publishing ratings on cryptocurrencies earlier this year.

The first grade the agency gave to bitcoin was C+, but Weiss recently upgraded the largest digital currency to B-.\nOf the 93 cryptocurrencies rated by Weiss, just 14 have grades of B while 54 carry C ratings. Ninety-three represents a scant a percentage of the overall crypto universe, which is currently populated by more than 1,500 alt-coins.\n“The new world of cryptocurrencies has delivered astonishing profits to investors and holds great promise for the future,” according to Weiss . “Millions of new investors have rushed in. Hundreds of self-declared experts have appeared to advise them. But the market suffers from lax standards, murky operators, marketing hype, and periodic market crashes. It desperately needs the clarity that only robust, impartial ratings can provide.”\nWeiss said the following of bitcoin in its initial rating: “ Bitcoin gets excellent scores for security and widespread adoption. But it is encountering major network bottlenecks, causing delays and high transactions costs. Despite intense ongoing efforts that are achieving some initial success, Bitcoin has no immediate mechanism for promptly upgrading its software code.” Report Cards\nNone of the alt-coins rated by Weiss have A grades.
