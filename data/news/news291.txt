It still may be considered an emerging technology, but Federated Investors portfolio manager Steve Chiavarone is folding the electronic system, which records cryptocurrency transactions, into his stock market forecast. Bitcoin, which has been referred to as the FANG stock of the crypto world, has been struggling to break $10,000 just months after hitting a record price just shy of $20,000 last December. In fact, Chiavarone sees FANG stocks, which include top tech names Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google [Alphabet], as ultimately reaping benefits from blockchain’s processing power as well as areas from health care to financials. A lot of investors went to bitcoin first because it was the first way to access blockchain, added Chiavarone.\nTags: Federated Investors portfolio, manager Steve Chiavarone, economic growth driver, stock market forecast, middle office costs\n@CNBC: Blockchain to help ‘drive this next industrial revolution’: @schiavarone says (via @TradingNation) https://t.co/mIOztlVNO0\nBlockchain will help ‘drive the next industrial revolution,’ a Wall Street bull predicts\nTyler Winklevoss tells Bill Gates how to short bitcoin Early bitcoin investor Tyler Winklevoss tweeted back at Bill Gates to explain how to bet against the cryptocurrency, after the Microsoft co-founder said he would short it if he could.

You can short #XBT, the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is! Earlier on Monday, Gates said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that bitcoin and ICOs, I believe completely [they’re some] of the crazier, speculative things.

When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight, says Williams, who tells CNBC Make It that his readings of astrological charts have pointed him in the direction of Bitcoin. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus, says Williams. The revolutionary aspect of Uranus in astrology, combined with Taurus’ focus on wealth and finance, is leading Williams to predict that, in the near future, we’re going to totally change the way we view and understand finances, he says. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action, Williams adds.

Blockchain Week’s annual event kicks-off May 11 in New York City, another sign that bitcoin is on the rise, Sluymer said. Sluymer said, historically, bitcoin has increased each year after Consensus, one of Blockchain Week’s largest events, which includes a hackathon and blockchain job fair, had taken place. Bitcoin continued to edge upwards in 2016, about 10 percent after the Consensus event, and then an additional 80 percent by year’s end, Sluymer said. The large-cap digital coin soared even more 69 percent around 2017’s Blockchain Week.

A look at CMC’s rankings shows only a couple of coins posting positive 24-hour price changes. However, in the midst of the general cratering, Bitcoin appears to be the least affected of the lot. South Korea: The Epicenter of Events\nUPbit , the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in South Korea, is currently under investigation. A joint task force of local police and financial regulators raided its Gangnam headquarters on May 10th. The platform is accused of diverting client funds into the wallets of its executives and forging its accounting records to cover up the malfeasance.\nThe reaction from the crypto community to the news followed the established script – panic. At some point on May 11th, the top 25 cryptos, according to market capitalization, were all in the red. Prices were declining by as much as 16 percent for tokens like Stellar, EOS, and Cardano .\nAccording to Marius Rupsys , a digital currency investor:\nThe main reason seems to be UPbit news. Most are talking about it, and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop.\nCrypto prices in South Korea are usually at a premium ( KimChi premium ) to the rest of the market. For the most of 2018, this premium was non-existent as the market recovered from a slow start to 2018. By the last week of April, market observers reported that the premiums were back . This return coincided with a considerable increase in average prices and total market capitalization values. As a result, any blip in the country’s local crypto market causes shockwaves in the global arena.\nHowever, some analysts believe that the present situation is an exaggerated reaction. According to Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of the crypto hedge fund firm, BitBull Capital:\nAs is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The UPbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow a thicker skin. Bitcoin Resilience\nBitcoin has so far suffered less of a decline than most other cryptos. The number one crypto fell below $9,000, but regarding percentage movement, its fall was much lower than the other top ten cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are attributing this to the stability of Bitcoin compared to other cryptos. Commenting on the stability of Bitcoin, Shone Antsey of Blockchain Intelligence Group said:\nBTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price. Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect. Bitcoin is the one to watch, since if it fails they all fail.\nCrypto enthusiasts expect Bitcoin to make a full recovery beginning from the upcoming Blockchain Week in New York.\nIs the market reaction to the UPbit saga exaggerated?

Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan's SoftBank to launch a \"blockchain-powered data roaming service\" in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power \"finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.\"\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea's borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company's remaining divisions.

These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day.

Literally. Product Analyst @Olark by day, Batman by night. May 12 Bitcoin is killing the planet: Fact or Fiction? NOTE: This post is meant to be a beginner’s guide to Bitcoin’s impact on the environment, and some technical details and caveats have been omitted for brevity. This post is not intended to be investment advice. Even though Bitcoin has tremendous potential for social good and financial inclusion , it also has a major PR problem. Many of Bitcoin’s biggest misconceptions have persisted for way longer than they ever should have. Here are a few examples: Bitcoin is worthless because it isn’t backed by anything Bitcoin is perfect for criminals because it is anonymous and untraceable Bitcoin’s energy consumption is wasteful and out of control Criticisms #1 and #2 have already been widely debunked: Bitcoin is no more “worthless” than the US dollar. Currencies don’t have to be backed by real-world commodities like gold or oil in order to have real-world value. The US dollar has not been backed by gold since 1971 , and even the Federal Reserve acknowledges that the US Dollar has no intrinsic value . A currency has value as long as enough people are willing to use it, and the Bitcoin network already handles billions of dollars’ worth of real money every day . If other payment systems like PayPal and Venmo have value , then why not Bitcoin? Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, every single Bitcoin transaction that has ever happened is permanently recorded in Bitcoin’s public blockchain forever, for anyone to see . Both law enforcement agencies and companies have become very proficient at tracing Bitcoins to their source, causing many criminals to ditch Bitcoin for other more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies . For true anonymity, physical cash is still king. Take it from Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice and its first-ever Digital Currency Coordinator: The criticisms around Bitcoin’s “intrinsic value” and supposed untraceability are losing their power as more people become aware of the facts. However, the facts around Criticism #3 — Bitcoin’s energy consumption — paint a bleak picture. Not only is Bitcoin’s energy consumption already large, it’s growing every day with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. “ Whataboutism ” is an excuse, not a solution A common counterpoint is that even though Bitcoin consumes a lot of energy, its overall environmental impact is still less than that of comparable industries like gold , physical currency , banking , credit cards , etc. That kind of rationalization might help Bitcoin enthusiasts sleep better at night, but it doesn’t actually address the root problem, which is that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is already disproportionally large for the relatively small number of transactions and users that it handles today, and could become a major threat to the planet if Bitcoin ever becomes as widely used as incumbents like VISA. If the Bitcoin community is serious about persuading its biggest critics and skeptics, mere Whataboutism is not enough. You can’t claim that Bitcoin will make the world a better place, while at the same time ignoring how it could do major damage in other ways to that very same world. We need to be able to demonstrate four things: Bitcoin’s energy usage is reasonable, when viewed in proper context All that electricity is actually serving a useful purpose Bitcoin’s growing energy needs can be brought under control Over time, the electricity for Bitcoin will increasingly come from renewable sources 1) Viewing Bitcoin’s energy consumption in the proper context Depending on who you ask and what assumptions they make in their calculations, Bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption is somewhere between 15 and 65 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, as of May 2018. That sounds like a really big number, but it’s hard to know how big it really is without further context. Bitcoin VS Countries You may have seen one of the countless news stories in the past year with headlines like “ Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity a year than Ireland ” ( 25 TWh ). That is technically true, but it’s a flawed “apples to oranges” comparison because Bitcoin is not a country, nor is it limited to a single country — it’s a new global financial system that can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world. If we’re going to use the world’s countries as a point of comparison, we should start with the fact that the world’s total electricity consumption is about 22,000 TWh per year , with China (6,300 TWh) and the United States (3,900 TWh) together making up almost half of the world’s total. That means that Bitcoin (15 to 65 TWh) currently makes up between 0.07% and 0.30% of the world’s annual electricity consumption. Bitcoin VS Power Plants The world’s largest power plants — the Three Gorges Dam in China and the Itaipu Dam in South America — each produce about 100 TWh per year , while the ten largest power plants in the United States generate between 19 and 33 TWh per year . In other words, Bitcoin’s electricity consumption today (15 to 65 TWh) is comparable to the annual generation of a single large power plant. Bitcoin VS Other Industries Some people like to (favorably) compare Bitcoin’s energy consumption to that of industries like banking or gold, but I’m not a fan of that approach because the way Bitcoin uses energy is so fundamentally different. For example, the global banking system consumes less electricity per transaction than Bitcoin, but it also employs millions of employees and maintains hundreds of thousands of bank branches and corporate offices that all require extra energy that is difficult to account for. And gold is an even messier comparison. Despite its misleading name, Bitcoin “mining” is a purely digital activity, while gold mining is a physical activity that destroys landscapes and vital ecosystems, and releases toxic substances like cyanide and mercury into the environment. Bitcoin VS Internet Data Centers My favorite approach is comparing Bitcoin’s energy consumption to that of the world’s data centers , which are the backbone of the Internet and all the web-based services we use nowadays. Bitcoin mining centers and internet data centers have a lot in common. They both require minimal human staff to operate, they both require a lot of electricity, and they even look similar — they’re both just endless racks of computer hardware: A large Bitcoin mining center in China ( ieee.org) A Google data center ( imgur.com ) Data centers in the US alone consume about 70 TWh , while data centers worldwide consumed 416.2 TWh of electricity in 2015 . (Google consumed 5.7 TWh that same year.) In other words, Bitcoin’s global electricity consumption (15 to 65 TWh) is still less than that of data centers in the US alone, and is between 4% and 16% of data centers worldwide. 2) What is all that energy for, anyway? Let’s say you agree that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is reasonable and not as bad as you thought, when viewed in the right context. That may not be good enough for critics, who have been led to believe that Bitcoin’s only real purpose is to enrich greedy investors. To them, it’s a crime to “waste” so much electricity just so the rich can get richer. If you believe Bitcoin isn’t good for anything, then no amount of electricity would ever be acceptable — not 100 TWh per year, or 10 TWh, or even 1 TWh. However, saying Bitcoin’s electricity consumption is “pointless” stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what Bitcoin actually is, and the reason it uses all that electricity. Bitcoin can make banking free and accessible for everyone Simply put, Bitcoin is a new technology that allows anyone with an internet connection to freely and securely transfer money online to anyone anywhere in the world, without having to go through a bank or other financial institution. If you’re new to Bitcoin, I’ve written previously about the new and exciting things made possible by Bitcoin’s core technology: NOTE: This post is meant to be a non-technical explanation of the capabilities of Bitcoin for those unfamiliar with the… medium.com TL;DR — It’s easy to think Bitcoin is “pointless” if you live in a developing country and have easy access to bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and stock trading. However, 2 billion adults worldwide are still completely “ unbanked ” and don’t have access to any of those things. By creating secure digital money that is divorced from governments and corporate profit motives, Bitcoin could eventually do for banking what Wikipedia did for knowledge: make it free and universally accessible for anyone, anywhere. That is pretty cool, but you might also be wondering how something like that is even possible, since money and currency have seemingly always been handled by banks and governments. How can a global payment network operate without any company or government running it? Building a decentralized financial system from scratch Normally, financial transactions are processed by banks and credit card companies using their own centralized servers and network infrastructure. These companies then pass these costs onto customers in the form of transaction fees, like the $50 it can cost to make an international wire transfer, or the 3% fee for processing credit card transactions. A decentralized financial system would need to be able to do three things in order to build an infrastructure that is independent of banks and governments: “ Crowdsource ” as many computing resources as possible from across the world to process transactions Incentivize the owners of those computing resources to continuously contribute them to the Bitcoin network Make all this as easy and accessible as possible, so that anyone in the world with an internet connection and the right computer hardware can contribute. Bitcoin’s “ proof of work ” system is a solution to these challenges. It’s designed so that the more computing power you contribute to the network (to help it process transactions), the higher your chances of winning the 12.5 BTC “mining reward” that is generated with each 1 MB “block” of transactions which is mined every 10 minutes on average. The 12.5 BTC mining reward is what incentivizes people to contribute computing power to the network, and it works like a lottery — winning is random, but the more “lottery tickets” you have (i.e. the more computing power you contribute), the higher your chances of winning. As the price of Bitcoin rises, those 12.5 BTC become more valuable, which attracts more miners hoping to strike it rich. (Mining can be done by anyone with an internet connection and the right computer hardware .) More miners means more competition, which makes it increasingly difficult and energy-intensive to win each block’s mining reward. More Electricity = More Security This system of increasing difficulty and resource expenditure (i.e. the “work” in proof of work) is what makes Bitcoin so secure, even as Bitcoin’s price rises and becomes a high-profile target for hackers. If a major corporation or national government wanted to disrupt or even shut down the Bitcoin network, they would have to expend a huge amount of computing power and electricity (and money, time, and effort) to do so — enough to power a large country for several years. As a result, to this day the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked. So to answer the original question — “What is all that electricity for?” — it’s an investment in the ongoing security of a new global financial network with no single owner and no corporate profit motive, that no bank or government can exploit for their own power or enrichment. In other words, Bitcoin’s electricity consumption is, quite literally, the cost of true monetary freedom. 3) Scaling Bitcoin’s energy consumption Let’s say you agree that the electricity expended to mine Bitcoin serves an important purpose, and could end up helping a lot of people. Even so, what is most worrying to critics is the amount of electricity that Bitcoin mining consumes today per transaction , and how much that might increase as Bitcoin becomes more popular. Despite Bitcoin’s recent surge in public awareness , the transaction volume of Bitcoin still pales in comparison to that of the incumbent financial systems: Bitcoin handles an average of 300,000 transactions per day , or about 3.5 per second. PayPal handles an average of 21 million transactions per day , or about 240 per second. (70x more than Bitcoin) VISA handles an average of 150 million transactions per day , or about 1,700 per second. (500x more than Bitcoin) Believe it or not, Bitcoin already consumes more electricity than VISA’s and PayPal’s payment networks, despite handling much fewer transactions. However, it’s important to remember that the Bitcoin is a very young technology compared to PayPal (1998) and VISA (1958), and there are good reasons to believe that it will become a lot more efficient as it matures. Case Study: Data Centers in the US This isn’t the first time that people have worried that a new internet-based technology will end up killing the planet. In fact, people were saying the same exact thing about the internet itself back in the 1990s and 2000s. Back then, the criticism was directed at the booming demand for energy-hogging data centers, which were necessary to process and fulfill requests for the millions of new websites that were being loaded and clicked every second. As a result, the electricity consumption of data centers in the US doubled from about 30 TWh per year in 2000 to nearly 60 TWh per year by 2005. Had that growth rate continued, data centers in the US alone would have consumed almost 500 TWh per year by 2020 (more than all but 8 countries today), and more electricity than the entire United States uses today (3,900 TWh per year) by 2035. But that’s not what happened. Here’s what US data center electricity consumption actually looked like from 2000 until now: Source: U.S. Department of Energy After growing an average of 15% per year from 2000–2005, the average annual growth rate fell to a mere 1% per year from 2010–2014, and that trend is expected to continue through 2020, when it is projected to be 73 TWh. 73 TWh is a far cry from 500 TWh — what caused the growth rate to fall so dramatically between 2005 and 2010? Long story short, data centers became a lot more energy-efficient, especially at the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, with their huge and highly-optimized “hyper-scale” data centers . These innovations made it possible for the total electricity consumption from US data centers to remain almost constant, even as the demand for data center services has continued to grow rapidly. (All those YouTube cat videos have to be processed somewhere.) “It’s like déjà vu all over again.” The same hand-wringing is happening again today with Bitcoin, with one media outlet going so far as to warn that by February 2020, Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will use as much electricity as the entire world . Misguided extrapolations aside, in reality it’s much more likely that the growth of Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will tail off over time as mining becomes increasingly more optimized and energy-efficient. That’s not to say that we should just sit around and wait for it to happen — we all have a role to play in making sure it happens as soon as possible. Here are just a few ways the growth of Bitcoin’s electricity consumption can be tamed: More efficient computer hardware: Bitcoin miners are highly incentivized to use the most energy-efficient mining hardware available. It’s better for their profit margins, and just happens to be better for the environment as well. Today, the most energy-efficient mining hardware is manufactured by the upstart Chinese company Bitmain , which has become the dominant player in the bitcoin mining and chip manufacturing industries. More recently, incumbents like Intel (the world’s largest semiconductor chip maker) have been looking to get in the game as well by filing patents and looking to create even more energy-efficient mining hardware . Increased competition could lead to even faster improvements in energy efficiency. Miners leave as the value of the mining reward decreases: There are two ways this could happen. First, mining and electricity consumption increases when Bitcoin’s exchange rate rises, so when the exchange rate of Bitcoin eventually stabilizes, the growth in mining and its electricity consumption should stabilize as well. Second, the mining reward wasn’t always 12.5 BTC. It started at 50 BTC in 2009, and has been automatically halving every 4 years . As the exchange rate stabilizes and the mining reward continues halving, that should mean a smaller “pie” of mining revenue, which would lead to less mining and less electricity consumption. Changing Bitcoin’s mining rules: Bitcoin’s “proof of work” mining rules are not set in stone, and it is possible (via its open-source software ) to change Bitcoin’s mining algorithm to one that is more energy-efficient. However, such a major change would have to be carried out with the utmost care and restraint, since the security of hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of real people’s money would be at stake. For what it’s worth, proof of work is still by far the most secure and proven algorithm that we’ve seen to date, although notably the people behind Ether (the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency) are exploring switching from proof of work to a more environmentally friendly proof of stake system. A successful transition by Ethereum could pave the way for Bitcoin to eventually do the same. Unfortunately, all of these possibilities come with a lot of risk and uncertainty — more efficient hardware could actually lead to even more mining and electricity consumption by lowering the barriers to entry ; no one can reliably predict or control Bitcoin’s price; and Bitcoin switching away from proof of work to another mining algorithm is still many years away, if it ever happens at all. However, there is another new solution that is entirely within our control and would unambiguously be a game changer for the environment if it catches on. The Dark Horse Scaling Solution I’m talking about the Lightning Network , which was conceived in 2014, proposed and and formalized in 2015, and after several years of R&D was launched in beta in Mar 2018. Bitcoin is only capable of processing a maximum of 7 transactions per second (tps), and in its current form would not be able to support the transaction volume of billions of users across the world. The Lightning Network was designed to make it possible for Bitcoin to securely process hundreds, thousands, and even millions of times more transactions than it can today, allowing it to reach PayPal (240 tps) and VISA (1,700 tps) levels and beyond. And best of all, those extra Bitcoin transactions wouldn’t require any additional electricity, because transactions that happen on the Lightning Network don’t require any additional mining. A metaphor for how the Lightning Network works Imagine you’re at a bar, and over the course of the night you end up buying one hundred drinks. You could pay for each of the hundred drinks individually, by pulling out your credit card each time and signing one hundred different receipts. But that would be very inconvenient and time-consuming for both you and the bartender. The same goes for paying in Bitcoin — each of those one hundred payments would have to be individually mined and processed, which would be a waste of time and an inexcusable waste of electricity. Instead, most bars allow you to open a tab. When you order your first drink, the bartender asks for your credit card or ID — some form of collateral so you won’t leave without paying. Over the course of the night, every time you order another drink it’s added to your tab, and at the end of the night you “close” your tab by paying for your hundred drinks all at once, after which you get back your credit card or ID. Instead of having to pay for one hundred $5 drinks one at a time, with a bar tab you only have to pay $500 once. That’s roughly similar to how you might pay someone via the Lightning Network. First, you would open what’s called a “payment channel” with the bar, and then post “collateral” in the form of an initial deposit transaction (let’s say, $700 worth of Bitcoin) on the blockchain to “open your tab”. After that, you can transact and buy as many drinks as you want on the Lightning Network. Once you’ve bought your one hundred drinks (costing $500) and are done for the night, you can “close your tab” by posting a second and final “settlement” transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain, in which the bar receives $500 in Bitcoin and you get back your remaining $200. In the example above, only the opening and closing “on-chain” transactions require electricity, while the 100 “off-chain” Lightning Network transactions don’t require any extra electricity at all. The Lightning Network aims to be the go-to place for smaller, lower-stakes transactions (e.g. buying coffee), while the energy-intensive Bitcoin blockchain would be reserved for larger transactions requiring maximum security (e.g. buying a house). It’s worth nothing that the Lightning Network is still brand new and is just one of many possible solutions to Bitcoin’s scalability problem . While there is still a healthy amount of skepticism and doubt as to whether it will end up being the best solution, there is no doubting that it would drastically reduce Bitcoin’s energy needs if it becomes widely adopted. 4) Bitcoin will keep getting greener Let’s say you agree that Bitcoin’s energy consumption growth could eventually be brought under control. Even then, none of that matters if Bitcoin’s electricity consumption is coming primarily from non-renewable and “dirty” sources like Coal. In a perfect world, all of Bitcoin’s energy consumption would come from only green, renewable sources. Thankfully, a lot of Bitcoin mining already happens with renewable energy, and there’s good reason to believe that trend will only accelerate going forwards. Economics of Bitcoin mining Bitcoin mining is a for-profit business like any other, where profitability is determined by revenue minus costs. Mining revenue is determined by the difficulty level of mining and the exchange rate of Bitcoin when you win a block’s mining reward, and the two main costs of mining are electricity and specialized ASIC computer hardware. The difficulty level and exchange rate of Bitcoin are out of miners’ control, and most serious miners use the same high-end hardware, which means the best way for miners to gain an edge over competitors and improve their margins is by finding the cheapest possible sources of electricity in the world. Electricity prices can vary greatly from country to country (and even within a country ), but as a general rule of thumb, “cheap electricity” is any energy source costing five cents ($0.05) per kWh or less. Today, the cheapest sources of electricity in the world are generally Coal power, which is non-renewable and dirty, and Hydroelectric and Geothermal power, which are renewable and green( -er ). Solar and Wind power have historically been much more expensive, but their costs have been plummeting in the past decade (see below), and they are expected to become competitive with Fossil Fuels by as soon as 2020 . Source: International Renewable Energy Agency It’s possible we may see an increase in mining with Solar and Wind power in the next few years, but that is an eternity in “Bitcoin time”, and building new large-scale power plants is a multi-year process that can cost billions of dollars. In the meantime, Bitcoin mining companies have been scrambling to seek out existing sources of cheap Coal, Hydroelectric, and Geothermal power across the world to satisfy their fast-growing energy appetites. In addition to the local cost of electricity, other important factors that influence where Bitcoin miners set up operations include: Local power plant(s) with high surplus capacity Fast internet speeds , since mining takes place online A stable and business-friendly government, which rules out otherwise promising places with cheap electricity like Venezuela and Russia Low average temperature , to help keep mining hardware cool Based on these criteria, most Bitcoin mining today happens in places like China , the United States , Canada , Europe (e.g. Iceland , Norway , Sweden , Austria ) and Georgia . What’s more, Bitcoin mining centers are very mobile and can easily be dispatched and relocated to wherever has the most favorable conditions. The Good News: Bitcoin miners are flocking to renewable energy sources Hydroelectric power has emerged as the go-to energy source for Bitcoin mining in much of the world. Not only is hydroelectric power very cheap, it’s also the most plentiful source of renewable electricity by far. 24.5% of the world’s electricity comes from renewable sources, and more than two-thirds of that comes from hydroelectric power. Hydroelectric power is a superior energy source for Bitcoin mining for several reasons: Cheaper: Hydroelectric power is often cheaper than even non-renewable sources like Coal and Nuclear power More Reliable: Solar and Wind power generation can vary depending on the weather Higher Capacity: Large-scale hydropower plants generally have the highest capacity of any energy source — more than Nuclear, Coal, Solar, Wind, and Geothermal power plants. As the world continues to move away from Coal electricity , and as renewable energy sources like Solar and Wind continue to become cheaper and more widely available, Bitcoin mining should continue to become greener as well. The Bad News: A lot of mining still happens with Coal electricity in China More than half of the world’s Bitcoin mining takes place in China, and that is bad news for the environment. Not only does China consume more electricity than any country in the world, it is also the world’s largest consumer of Coal electricity, which accounted for a whopping 66% of China’s total electricity generation in 2016 . We know that the mining centers in northern regions like Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia (aka “Neimonggu” below), and Heilongjian are powered by Coal electricity, while southern regions like Sichuan and Yunnan regions are powered by hydroelectricity. Source: Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study, University of Cambridge The heavy concentration of coal-powered Bitcoin mining in China is highly concerning, but there are a few silver linings here. First, China is not known for being very friendly to foreign businesses, which (thankfully) is an impediment to foreign miners looking to take advantage of China’s cheap Coal electricity. Second, the Chinese government recently started to crack down on Bitcoin mining by eliminating the discounts and tax deductions that have made electricity so cheap for Chinese mining companies. As a result, Chinese miners are looking to diversify and relocate their operations to places like Sweden , Switzerland , the United States , and Canada , among others. And thirdly, China also happens to be the largest producer of renewable electricity in the world , and over the past decade its renewable electricity capacity has consistently grown faster than its Fossil Fuels and Nuclear power capacity. We may reach a point in the future where “most Bitcoin mining happens in China” is actually great news for the environment, but until then we’ll have to hope that Chinese miners continue to leave China for cheaper, “greener” pastures abroad. “With great (electric) power comes great responsibility” Spider-Man (2002) Transformational new technologies are always a double-edged sword. For example, cars allow greater access to better jobs and nicer neighborhoods for lower-income families , but they are also responsible for most of the world’s air pollution , and millions of people are killed each year as a result of traffic collisions . Bitcoin is no different. Its biggest supporters are passionate about the technology because they can see all the good it could do for the world. However, even the best of intentions don’t absolve you of responsibility for the negative consequences that may arise from your work. The future is not set. Twenty years from now, Bitcoin might be praised for ushering in an unprecedented era of financial freedom and inclusion, or it might be hated and blamed for causing massive and irreparable harm to our planet. It all depends on us, and the choices we make — starting today.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zVzw912wPo",

After the fix, the notarization rates for all the nodes appears to be pretty good, though there is some catching up to do with the nodes that started with fresh pubkeys https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1P3rU1Nk1pmc2BiWC8dEy9bZa1ZbMp5jfg/transactions Above is where the notarizations go and if you see 6 notarizations in the last hour, things are running perfectly. It is normal for the occasional notarization round to not complete before the next round starts and in such cases, it is skipped. If you see a big gap (many hours) in notarizations, it indicates some sort of issue, ie. new notaries coming online or maybe even a blockchain event. So, if you are transacting a large amount, just make sure that notarizations are steady and best is if you want until your transaction is notarized URL: https://ift.tt/2rHIlRM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://notary.webworker.sh/", "https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1P3rU1Nk1pmc2BiWC8dEy9bZa1ZbMp5jfg/transactions", "https://ift.tt/2rHIlRM"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T02:16:51.080+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fee7cd37fe995b74150a6c9da33ffe2e1b36b5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWL4.fplZp2gU8cGJk4cAKmbxOSXASigLGWFyqWKphfx2vYGnL0FFJyosPiMQa3s0nInrJpXhREs0EQJqKdrgZK8ROyiQfMVXOYuZrmhoTG0cPBielchEkFkRywT_YmCx76.LSjQ12zA--", "site_full": "www.whatsonthorold.com", "site": "whatsonthorold.com", "site_section": "https://www.whatsonthorold.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "WhatsOnThorold", "title": "Analysts noticed Bitcoin Planet (BTPL)’s 24 hours move up of 8.91%", "title_full": "Analysts noticed Bitcoin Planet (BTPL)’s 24 hours move up of 8.91%", "published": "2018-05-12T19:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.whatsonthorold.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fee7cd37fe995b74150a6c9da33ffe2e1b36b5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWL4.fplZp2gU8cGJk4cAKmbxOSXASigLGWFyqWKphfx2vYGnL0FFJyosPiMQa3s0nInrJpXhREs0EQJqKdrgZK8ROyiQfMVXOYuZrmhoTG0cPBielchEkFkRywT_YmCx76.LSjQ12zA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adrian Mccoy", "published": "2018-05-12T19:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analysts noticed Bitcoin Planet (BTPL)’s 24 hours move up of 8.91%", "text": "Analysts noticed Bitcoin Planet (BTPL)’s 24 hours move up of 8.91%\nMay 12, 2018 - By Adrian Mccoy\nBitcoin Planet (BTPL) had a good 24 hours as the cryptocurrency jumped $0.0007564725 1 or 8.91% trading at $0.009245775.

I'm understanding your ask and this page correctly: https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/guides/send-receive\nThis would require you to already have USD on deposit in your Coinbase account. The page says they are working on a feature to automatically withdraw USD from a linked bank account (I wouldn't hold my breath for this).\nSince you explicitly asked about doing this via an API, I looked into this aspect a little bit, too: https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#transactions\nIn the example json on the right, I'm seeing that it has separate \"amount\" and \"native amount\" sections specifying BTC and USD respectively, and there's an \"instant_exchange\" field.

What we know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash shall be forking once more .\nHowever, this time since it shall be done at MTP time, there is no need to track block height. We anticipate this upgrade to take place on Tuesday, May 15 and there, the block size would be hiked to 32 MB from 8MB making it that largest ever block size increment in the world. Besides, their protocol data carrier sizes shall be increased to 220 bytes.\nIf you are a Bitcoin Cash full node or miner , please update, if not then you better stay on the side line and watch. Before the fork begins, full nodes should upgrade their clients to the 32 MB supporting Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version.\nSo, while speculations are rife that this upgrade shall increase Bitcoin Cash transaction throughput and fees, will this boost prices after the fork?

Prices kept falling, with USD 9,500 levels also being breached in the process.

Bitcoin markets are now under a great layer of uncertainty with the revelation that no level of support above USD 8,500 proved reliable. BTC/USD experienced losses greater than 5% through the day, a development that comes to follow trading sessions through which the price was already falling .\nGDAX BTC/USD charts are showcasing how the current state of the market came to be. With large sell orders being the driving force behind today’s downward spiral. Support didn’t seem to come up as the price was falling, even dipping below USD 9,400. The lack of support along with the strong selling pressure is something indicating a more dramatic shift in the market’s sentiment. While the outlook for markets wasn’t very positive to begin with, today’s trading session manages to make matters worse.\nOKEX BTC/USD weekly futures charts are showcasing how dramatically the take futures traders had on markets was able to change. Futures rates went from maintaining a positive difference between live market prices to going below live rates at times. Today’s trading session managed to cement the sentiment doubting positive movements as no downward pressure appeared to be receiving a notable positive response.\nAll in all, traders might be looking for prices substantially lower than even the current bottom reached under such a market sentiment.

Not to do so, he told CNN , is “almost irresponsible.” Crypto To Disrupt Every Vertical On Wednesday, Novogratz’s firm and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index , an index that tracks 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is important not on account of expected gains, Novogratz said, but because in two to four years blockchain technology, which allows companies to make and record near instant transactions, will be challenging every vertical.\nWhile the decentralized version of Uber may not be Uber, it will be a challenge and it constitutes a “real value proposition,” he said.\nNovogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner, said he has invested 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies.\nTraditional Institutions Testing The Waters nyse More Mainstream financial institutions, meanwhile, are finding ways to allow traditional investors to benefit from bitcoin. Nasdaq in April signed an agreement with Gemini Trust, a cryptocurrency exchange.\nOne unknown, however, is how governments will regulate cryptocurrency.\nNovogratz predicted the New York Stock Exchange will be active in cryptocurrency trading in less than six months.\nNot everyone on Wall Street agrees with Novogratz. Warren Buffett, an investment icon, has been bearish on bitcoin, having most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway ’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\nNovogratz said the difference in opinion is age-related, with older players much more skeptical about cryptocurrency.\nAlso read: Bitcoin bull Novogratz raises $250 million for cryptocurrency merchant bank\nGalaxy Digital Moves Forward Galaxy Digital , meanwhile, has announced plans to buy Canadian startup First Coin Capital and then merge with Bradmer Pharmaceuticals — which is publicly listed on the Toronto-based TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) — through a reverse takeover.\nFollowing the merger, Bradmer will be renamed to Galaxy Digital, allowing the company to trade publicly without having to undergo traditional financial disclosures associated with listing on an exchange.\nGalaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency merchant bank — which Novogratz reportedly hopes to make the “Goldman Sachs of Crypto” — will have a fourfold business model, according to public statements made by the firm.\nThe bank will open a cryptocurrency trading desk and initially seek to capitalize on opportunities for cross-exchange arbitrage. It will also invest in blockchain startups and ICOs, much as Novogratz intended to do through his now-shelved cryptocurrency hedge fund. Finally, it will provide advisory and asset management services to wealthy clients.\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Hudson River Park\nThe post ‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz appeared first on CCN .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5239695e8f82a286fa377424fe5ebc6f", "https://www.ccn.com/bloomberg-inks-deal-with-novogratz-founded-galaxy-digital-to-launch-cryptocurrency-price-index/", "https://www.ccn.com/bloomberg-inks-deal-with-novogratz-founded-galaxy-digital-to-launch-cryptocurrency-price-index/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/almost-irresponsible-to-not-invest-in-bitcoin-billionaire-mike-novogratz/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/tag/galaxy-digital/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fnCZ4uVtoI121fWPqYvE7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzUwO2g9NTAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5239695e8f82a286fa377424fe5ebc6f", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fnCZ4uVtoI121fWPqYvE7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzUwO2g9NTAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5239695e8f82a286fa377424fe5ebc6f);", "https://www.ccn.com/tag/mike-novogratz/", "https://www.ccn.com/novogratz-led-galaxy-digital-raises-250-million-for-cryptocurrency-merchant-bank/", "https://www.ccn.com/almost-irresponsible-to-not-invest-in-bitcoin-billionaire-mike-novogratz/", "https://www.ccn.com/novogratz-led-galaxy-digital-raises-250-million-for-cryptocurrency-merchant-bank/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/tag/galaxy-digital/&quot;", "http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/09/investing/markets-now-michael-novogratz/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortress investment group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T02:12:12.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "422db334cff53f6827d088a8a8c8564c8029a07e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiNU1p8NckxM0u6YlinSYPnuv7emTEnOy.wbgw8iG4wpDQTk_SSaUIUI-", "site_full": "thenewsunit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thenewsunit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The News UNIT", "title": "THE BITCOIN CARNAGE AND COLLAPSE CONTINUES", "title_full": "THE BITCOIN CARNAGE AND COLLAPSE CONTINUES", "published": "2018-05-12T18:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "422db334cff53f6827d088a8a8c8564c8029a07e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiNU1p8NckxM0u6YlinSYPnuv7emTEnOy.wbgw8iG4wpDQTk_SSaUIUI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The News UNIT (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T18:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "THE BITCOIN CARNAGE AND COLLAPSE CONTINUES", "text": "CRYPTOSPHERE CRASHES\nTHE END OF BITCOIN\nMAJOR CAPITULATION\nBITCOIN & CRYPTOS COLLAPSE\nCHART WIDGET WATCH\nCrypto Currencies make rapid drop in OVERALL MARKET CAPITALIZATION as money sells and evaporates into thin air.\nThe SHITCOIN RUSH and PUMP & DUMP SCAMS with the Jsnip4 and related CRYPTO-PSYCHIC CULT along with fraudulent remote viewers is now proving itself to be entirely a LESS THAN HONEST group of con artists that have been merchandising and making money off unwary investors and clients.\nAnyone who has been involved in the CRYPTO BUSINESS and giving financial advice through various fee for service subscriptions may be subject to SEC and or CFTC investigations.\nThings are going to get very troubling now in the Cryptosphere as the ongoing collapse intensifies...\nBTCUSD chart by TradingView\n...developing...

I've enjoy working here and being a part of a crypto world... We are because we know that it could really change in a lots of way.... It could help us to learn a lots about cryptocurrency and anything... Sometimes it is also the reason why we are updated always about news and current trends about crypto....

I think we need to have more limitations regarding on investing in the bitcoin feild for us to gain a huge amount in the near future and for us to loss a small amount of capital if ever we loss.\nIt depends on the capital you have. I think as much as you invest in bitcoin you will make big profits against your investment. Anyway I think that observe the market, select a coin because there are more than 1000 crypto in the market and then decide to invest. Selection of coin is more important than investment.

It covers the rise of altcoins, the civil war within the crypto community, the proliferation of ICOs, the evolving conversation with governments and regulators and the potential of blockchain technology beyond its application to currency.\nThe film is set to be released on the Binge platform in March 2019. SEG is in Cannes looking to beef up its ‘B-VOD’ roster and during the festival the firm announced a tie up with the Sitges International Film Festival for the latter to become the first movie fest to accept cryptocurrency.\nThe company has just released a promotional video fronted by The 100 and Okja actor Dylan Bostick about the firm, which looks like it wants to be the Netflix of cryptocurrency. Blockchain has been one of the watchwords of this year’s Cannes Film Festival.\nEntertainment companies looking to use virtual currency are springing up left right and centre.

Bitmain’s Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance\nBitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips.\nThe development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware.

Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank to launch a “blockchain-powered data roaming service” in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power “finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.”\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea’s borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company’s remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York\nThe latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018. Established in 2013, the summit has set up shop in Chicago, San Francisco, Singapore and, most recently, Las Vegas, with focuses on emerging innovations in mobile, IoT and digital advertising technologies.\nThis latest installment will concentrate on advancements in blockchain technology and its application to traditional industries. To this end, the CDX Blockchain Brand Innovation Summit has an extensive list of speakers and panelists both from within and without the blockchain space, featuring representatives from the likes of Hulu, CNBC, IBM and BTC Media. Breaking Bitcoin Conference Heading for Lisbon This Summer as “Building on Bitcoin”\nThe Breaking Bitcoin conference, first organized last summer in Paris, is returning for its second edition under the name “ Building on Bitcoin ,” this time in Lisbon, July 3–4, 2018. While the event in the French capital was centered around security, the one in the Portuguese capital will focus on second-layer technologies and other creative uses of the Bitcoin protocol.\nBuilding on Bitcoin will focus on second-layer technologies in a broad sense. The best known and most popular of these is probably the Lightning Network , of which the first implementations entered their beta stage over the past couple of months. But other areas of research and development include different types of sidechains like Liquid , RSK or drivechains ; privacy technologies like TumbleBit ; smart contract solutions like MAST ; and more.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ambcrypto.com/bitmain-launches-antminer-z9-mini-to-mine-zcash-zec/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmains-antminer-z9-mini-designed-mine-zcash-threatens-asic-resistance/", "http://cdxforum.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-creating-the-network-1465326903/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/breaking-bitcoin-paris-set-host-new-technical-bitcoin-conference/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-drivechains-could-kill-altcoin-market/", "http://cdxforum.com/blockchain18/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/breaking-bitcoin-conference-heading-lisbon-summer-building-bitcoin/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/with-tumblebit-bitcoin-mixing-may-have-found-its-winning-answer-1477423607/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nyt-report-parent-company-nyse-planning-bitcoin-exchange/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/no2x-breaking-bitcoin-shows-no-love-segwit2x-hard-fork-paris/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lightnings-first-implementation-now-beta-developers-raise-25m/", "https://z.cash/", "https://building-on-bitcoin.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-next-big-thing-rsk-smart-contract-sidechain-launches-developer-release-integrated-in-jaxx-wallet-1478720778/", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cdx-brings-inaugural-blockchain-summit-new-york/", "https://www.globaldata.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-next-step-to-improve-bitcoin-s-flexibility-scalability-and-privacy-is-called-mast-1476388597/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-completing-the-puzzle-and-closing-the-channel-1466178980/", "http://www.rttnews.com/2879445/japan-s-line-launches-blockchain-unit-in-south-korea.aspx", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/globaldata-south-korea-among-worlds-leading-markets-blockchain-technology/", "https://breaking-bitcoin.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstream-to-launch-first-instant-settlement-sidechain-for-bitcoin-exchanges-1444755147/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aaron van wirdum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick marinoff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "miners and conferences home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic antminers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "itcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T22:13:39.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3357379c1e69e79e770cadbb5aef5dd752bec11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSE649muu1kdzaFUPS7GL3tAf67LM5XpczC5q4XF6iS3N.zNM8aa0lnwn2k_dP64gyWLg1zGclQm4BptxbU4MWxChIbpnPmnsHzQsIjx18jPL4", "site_full": "bitcoin-news-today.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoin-news-today.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin news", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences", "title_full": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences", "published": "2018-05-12T18:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3357379c1e69e79e770cadbb5aef5dd752bec11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSE649muu1kdzaFUPS7GL3tAf67LM5XpczC5q4XF6iS3N.zNM8aa0lnwn2k_dP64gyWLg1zGclQm4BptxbU4MWxChIbpnPmnsHzQsIjx18jPL4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newman (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T18:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences", "text": "\nWhile Bitmain creates new ASIC Antminers to mine any cryptocurrency running Equihash proof of work, the affected cryptocurrencies look at measures to prevent it.

Over the last 12 months, several popular TV shows including Mr. Robot have featured cryptocurrencies.\nNow, it’s Sesame Street’s turn.\nNo, the popular children’s program didn’t take time to teach toddlers about monetary policy, but mainstream financial publication Business Insider did devote a large portion of its recent interview with Cookie Monster (yes, that Cookie Monster) toward gauging the Muppet’s thoughts on bitcoin.\nShockingly, Cookie Monster did not know much about bitcoin. But he goes on to explain that he is familiar with the concept of “Bitcookie.”\n“Me know about Bitcookie. Me know that me have cookie and me do this. That me bit cookie.”\nCookie Monster then goes on to talk about self-regulation — a key topic of discussion within the nascent cryptocurrency indsutry. He confesses that he has an issue with regulating himself. He explains, if he sees a cookie he’s not supposed to eat, he takes a step back and looks away. Then, he would eventually eat it.\n“Me, OK, me do have issues with controlling meself. Fruit, cookie, fruit, cookie. Ah. This tough decision. So me got strategies me use to help me to control meself.

New York has a lot of news happening this week, with the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company looking to get into bitcoin trading and Blockchain Week kicking off with the CDX Summit. South Korea continues to be a leader in blockchain technology, rolling out new partnerships with neighboring countries, and building out more blockchain technology.\nFeatured stories by Colin Harper, Nick Marinoff and Aaron van Wirdum.\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Bitmain’s Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance\nBitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips.\nThe development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware. GlobalData: South Korea Among the World’s Leading Markets for Blockchain Technology\nAccording to analytics firm GlobalData , South Korea has become a leader in the blockchain community. Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank to launch a “blockchain-powered data roaming service” in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power “finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.”\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea’s borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company’s remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York\nThe latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018.

Over the last 12 months, several popular TV shows including Mr. Robot have featured cryptocurrencies.\nNow, it’s Sesame Street’s turn.\nNo, the popular children’s program didn’t take time to teach toddlers about monetary policy, but mainstream financial publication Business Insider did devote a large portion of its recent interview with Cookie Monster (yes, that Cookie Monster) toward gauging the Muppet’s thoughts on bitcoin. We spoke to Cookie Monster about bitcoin, cookies, and self-regulation https://t.co/QOTBUjQBO6 pic.twitter.com/HJojRiaNdw\n— Business Insider AUS (@BIAUS) May 10, 2018\nShockingly, Cookie Monster did not know much about bitcoin. But he goes on to explain that he is familiar with the concept of “Bitcookie.”\n“Me know about Bitcookie. Me know that me have cookie and me do this. That me bit cookie.”\nCookie Monster then goes on to talk about self-regulation — a key topic of discussion within the nascent cryptocurrency indsutry. He confesses that he has an issue with regulating himself. He explains, if he sees a cookie he’s not supposed to eat, he takes a step back and looks away. Then, he would eventually eat it.\n“Me, OK, me do have issues with controlling meself. Fruit, cookie, fruit, cookie. Ah. This tough decision. So me got strategies me use to help me to control meself. Well, what me like to um, to control meself, me sometimes like to take deep breath. And it calm youself down. So like, if me saw a cookie right there, and me wanted to eat said cookie, me would just kind of take a little step back, maybe distract meself, maybe look away. No see cookie. Maybe sing a song.

Miners will rather verify transactions with a higher transaction fee to eventually receive it themselves but what if there were no fees involved, than all the transactions would be verified without other considerations. The only reason I can think of is that with no transaction fees, when all the bitcoins are mined, there will be no more incentive for the miners and the network will fail.
