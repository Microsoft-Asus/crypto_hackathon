This decentralized technology is designed to be free and open to everyone. As such, trademarks and patents can cause a lot of unnecessary hindrances. In the United Kingdom, one company successfully trademarked the word ‘Bitcoin’.\nA Trademark With Major Implications Trademarking a commonly used term is not all that straightforward. Although one could obtain a trademark for the term “Bitcoin”, enforcing that trademark will be a different matter altogether. After all, the term Bitcoin has been ‘trademarked’ before, but it was never used to prosecute people using this term irrespective of their commercial interest.\nEven so, one particular company in the United Kingdom somehow managed to trademark the term “Bitcoin” in late 2017. It is a bit unclear how the company went about achieving this and what they aim to do with it moving forward. The current relationship between Monopolip Ltd. and the cryptocurrency industry also remains a bit unclear at this time.\nThe bigger concern is what this approved trademark filing means for the cryptocurrency industry itself. For most people and companies, this will not result in any major changes. One Reddit user, however, explained that he had received a cease and desist letter when using the Bitcoin term in connection with his T-shirt business. Considering that most of his shirts pertain to Bitcoin, there is an issue here.\nEnforcing this trademark filing outside the United Kingdom will be pretty challenging. Within that nation’s borders, however, the situation is quite different. Considering that the aforementioned Reddit user is seemingly running a UK-based shop, there is some legal gray area to explore.\nThere have been a few unsuccessful attempts at trademarking Bitcoin the US over the past few years. That doesn’t mean people will stop trying in the years to come, though. Cryptocurrencies are extremely popular right now, and it is only normal that more people will look to them in an effort to get rich. Using various methods to do so is to be expected, although opting for a trademark filing is pretty bothersome.\nIt will be interesting to see how this situation plays out. The term ‘Bitcoin’ is far too generic to be trademarked, yet the UK government decided to grant the trademark regardless. Whether or not that decision will hurt the industry moving forward remains to be seen. It’s a very peculiar situation that will spark many debates moving forward.\nfrom The Merkle http://bit.ly/2xl8NGQ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "monopolip ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:24:55.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "103bd7becc6a3023728dddef797ecfc9cc3ae526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY5G5Dww8J2qde7Rgv7lity51RMunZSnAXi19SRfCifBM7v9aZhhipKtRvY240nDiqA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "General Bytes Installs 10 Bitcoin ATMs Across Prague Subway Routes", "title_full": "General Bytes Installs 10 Bitcoin ATMs Across Prague Subway Routes", "published": "2018-05-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "103bd7becc6a3023728dddef797ecfc9cc3ae526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY5G5Dww8J2qde7Rgv7lity51RMunZSnAXi19SRfCifBM7v9aZhhipKtRvY240nDiqA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "General Bytes Installs 10 Bitcoin ATMs Across Prague Subway Routes", "text": "The capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague, has become the scene of the latest explosion of bitcoin-related development as General Bytes has installed a network of ten bitcoin ATMs at different points along the city's subway routes.\nThe map shows the current locations of the ten bitcoin ATMs in Prague.

Don&s;t put all of your chips on the table at once.\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, in most cases, you&s;re betting that the cryptocurrency will go up indefinitely. That&s;s the nature of a bubble when speculators dominate.\nBut what if you had a chance to protect yourself on the downside? You can do it with derivatives, contracts that may pay you if the price of something goes down (and up).\nFor example, &l;a href=&q;http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/bitcoin-futures.html&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;the CME Group,&l;/a&g; which runs one of the largest derivatives exchanges offers futures contracts on the reference price of Bitcoin.\n&l;img class=&q;dam-image getty size-large wp-image-865708344&q; src=&q;http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/865708344/960×0.jpg?fit=scale&q; data-height=&q;640&q; data-width=&q;960&q;&g; A visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\nA futures contract is an agreement that&s;s linked to a price on a specified date in the future. Let&s;s say you think Bitcoin is going to hit $20,000 by a certain date.\nYou could buy a contract with that &q;strike price.&q; If Bitcoin hits that target, you make money. If not, you lose what you paid for the contract. You could also hedge if the price goes down.\n&q;The new contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin,&q; the &l;a href=&q;http://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2017/10/31/cme_group_announceslaunchofbitcoinfutures.html&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;CME said in a press release&l;/a&g;. &q;Bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME.&q;\nNote the CME&s;s mention of&a;nbsp; &q;rules.&q; That means the exchange is careful about tracking what it calls the &q;reference&q; price of Bitcoin and making price disclosure transparent. The exchange is also providing free &l;a href=&q;http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cf-bitcoin-reference-rate/historical-data.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTWpabVptUXlaRGM1WWpZeSIsInQiOiJmTm4yTE9NVlZCalwvanVraEVsb3R4bE54Z3ZkS2w3dlhpRVJLaWJ3MCtKZk1tN282MXIyRlVTcEJ0RWxnMk1YQjdMb3pPWTV3eUZFajNJaWpLcVFUQnNsNGROREs4c21GNkVOd1dyZE56WjFlSTYwNHBYSGpSbnFFSlFtODVWblAifQ%3D%3D&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;historical price data&l;/a&g;, so you can see how volatile the cryptopcurrency has been.\nAlthough the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin isn&s;t exactly transparent — only a few people know exactly how it works or how it originated — getting an exchange to track the price is a positive development. It means an independent body will be watching how the price is set. While this is no substitute for real regulation, it&s;s a good first step.\nThe CME is also monitoring a &q;spot&q; price for Bitcoin, which is what the cryptocurrency is worth at any given moment.\nAlthough nearly any investor can get into trouble with derivatives — they can be caught too long or too short and lose a lot of money — it&s;s essential that you have a way to protect yourself if the market crashes.\nKeep in mind as with any investment, portfolio diversification is a good move. Don&s;t load up on Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. It should comprise no more than 10% of your portfolio.&l;/p&g; by admin .

Bitcoin is known for its great value and trusted. This is the first ever virtual currency and the mother of all cryptocurrencies.

Recently, British economic historian and author Niall Ferguson told the Bank of England that Bitcoin is the financial system of the future.\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car The Future of Finance\nNiall Ferguson is a noted historian, commentator, and the author of fifteen books including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild. On Tuesday he has given a seminar to the Bank of England, talking about the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it to this day. In his conclusion of the subject, he mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based system.\nFerguson said: “The financial system of today is not fundamentally that different than the financial system of the pre-crisis period, except that big banks are better capitalized. I don’t think much else is really different. The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that’s the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018. In short, I am left feeling we are only a matter of time before the next crisis.” Bombarded by ICOs\nThe above isn’t such a surprising statement coming from Ferguson. Back in December 2017 he wrote: “At some point, no doubt, regulatory changes in the US will deflate the current bitcoin bubble. But they will not halt, much less undo, this financial revolution. Think about it this way. The maximum number of bitcoins that can be created is 21m. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000. I am not saying this is certain to happen. I’m just saying my teenage son thinks it could.”\nSince then he has also been exposed to more sides of the cryptocurrency market, such as the endless flood of ICO offers. “I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson reportedly said last week. “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.”\nFerguson isn’t the only noted academic figure that looked at how bitcoin fits economic history recently. Last Monday, Professor Robert Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel prize in economics and is famous for the Case-Shiller Index, published an article talking about the way the allure of bitcoin fits enthusiasm around previous attempts to reinvent money.\nWhat role in the economy do you see Bitcoin fulfills in ten years from now?

Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol .\nRight now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nWhat Happened At Graceland’s Ethereum Conference In its first year, EthMemphis distinguished its place on the blockchain conference circuit for displaying an under-the-hood glimpse at what actually moves this young industry forward, specifically on the Ethereum network.

The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $1.7 million) being stolen. The theft occurred when hackers exploited a specific glitch in Verge’s technology by mining multiple blocks virtually one second apart using the same algorithm. This was the same tactic used in a hack just last month that saw over 250,000 XVGs disappear into thin air, forcing Verge to prepare a subsequent hard fork .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nRead Article Full Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors : https://ift.tt/2IVbsZf", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick marinoff stay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hollerith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paradex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paradex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:56:58.047+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9be1755c533fdf05fb94d0b25647fe8921bce90f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhB0Z_tvY2fd3cYxEH4dJ9kE-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T20:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9be1755c533fdf05fb94d0b25647fe8921bce90f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhB0Z_tvY2fd3cYxEH4dJ9kE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T20:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 27, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Price to Bottom at $5700 in Short-Term Before Recovery: Analyst CCN Willy Woo, a respected cryptocurrency, and digital asset analyst, recently stated that the bitcoin price might likely fall below the $6,000 mark in the ...

In London, police officials arrested one particular hacker and seized $667,000 worth of Bitcoin in the process. It remains unclear what will happen to the confiscated Bitcoins, although it seems likely they will be auctioned off.\nAnother Bitcoin-related Arrest It is evident criminals are drawn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for many reasons. One of the main reasons for this is that many people perceive Bitcoin and similar currencies as being anonymous. In reality, however, Bitcoin itself lacks privacy and anonymity features, whereas a few other currencies – such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash – take a completely different approach.\nEven so, criminals will try many different tactics to get their hands on cryptocurrency in one way or another. A hacker known as Grant West has successfully attacked dozens of companies around the globe using phishing scams. By using this method of attack, he was able to extricate sensitive financial data, which was then sold on dark web marketplaces in exchange for Bitcoin.\nEvidence of West’s crimes has been uncovered by the London Metropolitan Police. More specifically, they linked at least 17 different cyber attacks to him. Those attacks were directed at many major UK-based enterprises such as Sainsbury’s and Asda, as well as a Finnish Bitcoin exchange. It’s quite an impressive list, although it is certainly possible that a lot more attacks have yet to be documented.\nIn a raid on West’s home, police officials also recovered a memory card which contained 78 million usernames and passwords. It is unclear what platforms this information pertains to exactly, but it is safe to assume these details were sold on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin. Officials have not commented on which dark web markets were used to sell the stolen information over the past few years.\nWith over $660,000 worth of Bitcoin having been seized, another issue will need to be addressed. It is unclear what the Metropolitan Police will do with this cryptocurrency. In most cases, such holdings are auctioned off to the highest bidder. However, this is the first case of its kind for the 188-year-old department, which means they will first have to devise a course of action.\nUnfortunately, it’s evident that criminals will continue to pay attention to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That is rather worrisome, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has a lot of negative associations with criminal activity already. At the same time, this arrest shows that Bitcoin is not a suitable tool for criminals, as they will be brought to justice eventually.\nfrom The Merkle http://bit.ly/2xk7bNm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "metropolitan police seize", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T21:24:56.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76badac5ecf5b68d5d5a3506e210ae4c59780e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqay8ubCPQTpmS3qGw0o2lF522s.35yHy98GboBp7XgydkARpt2DWmA4bPYzbKZzJhdL7fpBIn6FdXbLwUMdhCmeW4QfpiOqkWy", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Can the Biggest U.S. Bitcoin Exchange Win Over Wall Street?", "title_full": "Can the Biggest U.S. Bitcoin Exchange Win Over Wall Street? : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-27T20:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76badac5ecf5b68d5d5a3506e210ae4c59780e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqay8ubCPQTpmS3qGw0o2lF522s.35yHy98GboBp7XgydkARpt2DWmA4bPYzbKZzJhdL7fpBIn6FdXbLwUMdhCmeW4QfpiOqkWy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jreddit83", "published": "2018-05-27T20:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can the Biggest U.S. Bitcoin Exchange Win Over Wall Street?", "text": "submitted by /u/jreddit83\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-the-biggest-u-s-bitcoin-exchange-win-over-wall-street-1527418800?mod=e2tw"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:53:47.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93ccd56c0329ecf667acc8c39d88aa236e47031e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ojmpzPgQ0Cj98UjRhsxqdeg30OSwg.33QDHRZJt89FimBS1kJO3mvYykuXoPViLXwzgBT7DA0b5BNWTPMEO0seuC8Umvavw.fUyv.WikyPuXj7mIFoXpqD0TL4EwX9_Iel8dZghcXZiW9J3c8RgJz8mPMNQ0D4e8-", "site_full": "www.access-wallstreet.com", "site": "access-wallstreet.com", "site_section": "http://www.access-wallstreet.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Access WallStreet", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "title_full": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "published": "2018-05-27T20:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93ccd56c0329ecf667acc8c39d88aa236e47031e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ojmpzPgQ0Cj98UjRhsxqdeg30OSwg.33QDHRZJt89FimBS1kJO3mvYykuXoPViLXwzgBT7DA0b5BNWTPMEO0seuC8Umvavw.fUyv.WikyPuXj7mIFoXpqD0TL4EwX9_Iel8dZghcXZiW9J3c8RgJz8mPMNQ0D4e8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "awssysop", "published": "2018-05-27T20:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "text": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst remains a strong buy despite recent losses, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart told CNBC yesterday, May 26.

Coinbase is getting into the decentralized exchange business with its acquisition of Paradex, potentially opening up thousands of ERC-20 tokens to traders, depending on what the SEC ends up doing with regulations. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, continues work to implement a system to allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. And Germany’s Deutsche Boerse is looking at getting into the cryptocurrency game. Finally, the city of Memphis had its first blockchain conference, which included keynotes from FedEx and a hackathon for various market segments that included some great prizes.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, David Hollerith and Nick Marinoff\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Coinbase Takes Another Step Toward Trading ICO Tokens by Acquiring\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase just made an enormous play by acquiring decentralized relayer Paradex this week. Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol .\nRight now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Adding ERC20 tokens could significantly boost the number of digital assets it carries. Due to the ICO boom that has taken place over the last few years, thousands of different ICO tokens are now available. German Stock Exchange Eyes Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange parent company, Deutsche Boerse AG , appears to have begun work on technology that will allow them to offer their clients bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related products.\nSpeaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: “We are deep at work with it.” The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation\nAs reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future. What Happened At Graceland’s Ethereum Conference\nIn its first year, EthMemphis distinguished its place on the blockchain conference circuit for displaying an under-the-hood glimpse at what actually moves this young industry forward, specifically on the Ethereum network. The focus was on blockchain topics and projects applied to supply chain, healthcare, tourism/hospitality, education and law. Verge Cryptocurrency Suffers Its Second Hack in Less Than Two Months\nWhile Verge executives are claiming a DDoS attack is responsible for the recent serious delays on their blockchain, it appears that the problem may be more serious than the company is implying. The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $1.7 million) being stolen. The theft occurred when hackers exploited a specific glitch in Verge’s technology by mining multiple blocks virtually one second apart using the same algorithm. This was the same tactic used in a hack just last month that saw over 250,000 XVGs disappear into thin air, forcing Verge to prepare a subsequent hard fork .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/verge-cryptocurrency-suffers-its-second-hack-less-two-months/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-takes-another-step-toward-trading-ico-tokens-acquiring-paradex/", "http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/german-stock-exchange-eyes-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/old-new-thing-ice-and-future-bitcoin-trading-and-regulation/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/verge-is-forced-to-fork-after-suffering-a-51-attack/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/22/hackers-verge-blockchain-steal-1-7m/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/heres-what-happened-gracelands-ethereum-conference/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "https://ethmemphis.com/about", "https://paradex.io/", "https://0xproject.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nyt-report-parent-company-nyse-planning-bitcoin-exchange/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cryptocurrencie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick marinoff stay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hollerith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "investors bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paradex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:31:07.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cd12dd1fe7b8ab9e906ac8300040709061f4467", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSE0GRLXsdxom2jjW1k1KrOjOZDFREeaw4PyyDzl10P2Qb4mTjqpS7rITFLimJriUAg.KFEqgJLLNWXkeNWFueeHX_W1qKje6h1O0BCT2nsZQ3", "site_full": "bitcoin-infochain.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoin-infochain.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Infochain", "title": "What Happened to Bitcoin (BTC) These Past Few Days? - Yahoo Finance", "title_full": "What Happened to Bitcoin (BTC) These Past Few Days? - Yahoo Finance", "published": "2018-05-27T19:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cd12dd1fe7b8ab9e906ac8300040709061f4467", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSE0GRLXsdxom2jjW1k1KrOjOZDFREeaw4PyyDzl10P2Qb4mTjqpS7rITFLimJriUAg.KFEqgJLLNWXkeNWFueeHX_W1qKje6h1O0BCT2nsZQ3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AMP HQ (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T19:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Happened to Bitcoin (BTC) These Past Few Days? - Yahoo Finance", "text": "\nYahoo Finance\nWhat Happened to Bitcoin (BTC) These Past Few Days?\nYahoo Finance\nThe world's first and largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is famous for being the decentralized peer-to-peer network.

Related Articles Cryptocurrencies pose a threat, must be regulated, CEOs say\nA company promising massive returns to investors via Bitcoin, and which is under investigation by the Hawks, has claimed its “super shy” founding trader has absconded with all the money – and the leadership and admin team don’t know where he is.\nBut investors who have been fleeced for what the Hawks estimate may amount to R1 billion have been claiming for months on social-media support groups that the whole thing is an elaborate Ponzi scheme and the shy man never existed.\nOn Friday morning, the Hawks announced that BitCaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global, may have fleeced up to 28 000 investors.\n“The serious economic offences unit has been tasked to investigate the massive alleged fraud,” stated the Hawks in a media release.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest, with promises of 2% interest per day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month.”\nA representative of BitCaw Trading, however, denied in a Facebook message to Fin24 that the firm was linked to BTC Global.\n“BitCaw Trading was not involved in the BTC Global scam and we are shocked to see our name connected with it,” read the message.\n“BitCaw Trading assists people with buying and selling Bitcoin as well as other Bitcoin-related services. We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment.”\nMASTER TRADERS\nBTC Global on its website offered amazing deals to investors via its shadowy “master trader” Steven Twain. And Twain, states a message posted to the group’s site, has disappeared.\n“The admin team cannot locate him,” states the message.\n“If anyone has any information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know.”\nBut the issue is further complicated by the fact that on social media support groups, investors allege Twain never existed and his creation was part of an elaborate scam.\n“Steven Twain is an alias and not a real person,” states a post on the Facebook group BTC Global Scam, which has more than 740 likes.\nOther blogs have been created to argue that Twain is a real person. On one such blog, a South African woman named Cheri Ward writes that while she does not own BTC Global, she was in contact with Twain and created the btcglobal.team website with colleagues.\n“We built the btcglobal.team website to help people to create their profiles and to ask questions because we couldn’t handle all the queries and nor could Steven.\n“I had direct contact with Steven and I continue to have direct contact with admin, the leaders and many members,” she writes.\nShe posts screengrabs of text message conversations with someone who is apparently Twain. When asked why he does not send an image of himself and whether he is “supershy”, he replies: “Yes, very.”\nBut Ward writes on her blog she never interacted with Twain directly and only talked to him “on messenger and email”.\n“I pushed him [Twain] for a live video and asked him to address us all on Skype. He was dead set against it. I knew that if I pushed harder he would pull away. As a leadership we decided that we would let him have his peace, he had after all been making payments on time every Monday to hundreds of people without any trouble.”\nFin24 was not able to establish what Ward’s relationship to the company is, apart from promoting it and creating the website.\nHer cellphone went to voicemail when Fin24 called her on Friday morning.\nNEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET\nThe message now on BTC Global’s website – posted by “the admin team”– states that the only contact they had with Twain was via Facebook and a Gmail address. Fin24 sent emails to the address, which were not replied to.\n“We are as shocked and angry as everyone. But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven,” the message states.\n“Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found, there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nBefore the message was posted that Twain absconded with the money, BTC Global had sold itself as a way to make massive returns quickly.\n“Through our partnership with Steven, BTC Global has secured access to guaranteed 14% weekly returns from as little as $1 000 in your account,” the company stated.\nTwain was described as having “six years of experience trading binary options with consistent success. Over the past three years he has started providing trading services for other large account holders ($10 000+ only)”.\nTwain’s Facebook profile also appears to have been deleted.\nThe Hawks have asked anyone with information to contact them. – Fin24 WHAT TO READ NEXT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T02:02:17.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d91c02581a3543a80f828eb1ef58810180bf601", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__30OpcmZIUtc79lC3RAujvr7eHxt64Nxw.fMY1k3kKzK44bKTOBfZZVHstZnU0fMA8w--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "title_full": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "published": "2018-05-27T19:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d91c02581a3543a80f828eb1ef58810180bf601", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__30OpcmZIUtc79lC3RAujvr7eHxt64Nxw.fMY1k3kKzK44bKTOBfZZVHstZnU0fMA8w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T19:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "text": "Home » bitcoin » crypto » crypto news » news » Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nBitcoin remains a strong investment and will see at least $10k before year’s end, says blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart. Bitcoin remains a strong buy despite recent losses, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart told CNBC yesterday, May 26. The cryptocurrency will trade “at least” above $10,000 by the year’s end, he added. Bogart is a partner at major VC firm Blockchain Capital , and was reportedly the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin and blockchain, authoring a highly regarded blockchain industry report. Bitcoin has now seen three weeks in the negative, its “longest running streak of losses since September 2017,” as CNBC’s interview intro noted. Despite this, Bogart outlined a bullish forecast for the long term, saying that: “The long-term thesis is very much intact... The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occuring...Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they're going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk .” Bogart suggested however that many altcoins are likely “overvalued” and “have significant headwind,” emphasizing the dangers of relative valuation. He drew a parallel between the ICO boom in late 2017 - early 2018 and the dot-com boom of the early 2000s, warning that many crypto tokens are “over-promising and under-delivering.” Bogart said he would sell alts such as Cardano , TRON , IOTA and NEO , but was “neutral” and would hold Ethereum , Ripple , Bitcoin Cash and EOS . “I’m very constructive as regards Ethereum on a long-term basis,” he said. Nonetheless, he considered that Ethereum currently has “a lot of overhang” because of the many “overvalued” tokens that are built on its platform, and suggested that Ethereum’s future will be closely correlated to the future development of the ICO space. Bogart also noted that this has been the first sustained bear market where nobody has suggested the “end of Bitcoin.” He suggested that the reality of a deeper institutionalization of the crypto space is securing the long term “story,” and is “overall positive” for Bitcoin’s future. He also said that ongoing turbulence in the traditional financial sector, such as recent national fiat currency crises , is reinforcing Bitcoin’s use cases. \"Could Bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely… I would bet Bitcoin ends at least above $10,000 in the year.” Negative performance in the crypto markets for now seems to be continuing, with Bitcoin trading below $7,400 to press time, down a further 2 and half percent over the 24 hour period. This despite increasing provisions to facilitate mainstream investment in the crypto space, notably with a recent trend to provide custodian solutions for institutional holders. The ubiquity of the ‘ institutional investment will lead to a major market uptick’ narrative moved one prominent crypto commentator to protest this weekend: Two words I really don't want to hear this

IPHoldings South West ’ has successfully acquired a trademark for the name ‘Bitcoin’. According to a merchant on Etsy, IP-Holdings sent a cease and desist order because they were selling Bitcoin-themed t-shirts.\nAlso read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ UK Company Successfully Copyrights the Name ‘Bitcoin’\nThis week cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out the name ‘Bitcoin’ had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK on December 22, 2017. The news came as a shock to one merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was told to stop his operations or be held liable in a court of law. The letter states :\nIt has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994.\nContacting the company is difficult as there is very little information on the London-headquartered firm called IP-Holdings — minus one other patented IP product called ‘Westworld.’ The trademark itself, filed this past December, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as adult clothing, infants’ clothing, shoes, headbands, socks, and nearly everything that can be manufactured into a product. Trademark number ‘UK00003279106 Bitcoin’ was officially registered into the IPO’s records on April 13, 2018. The “BITCOIN” IPO trademark filed on December 22, 2017. Other Attempts to Trademark the Bitcoin Name Have Failed\nThe UK filing seems to be the first successful trademark using the name Bitcoin as there have been other undertakings in the past. Back in March of 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the company Urban Trend’s attempt to trademark the name Bitcoin (Reg 86135516 ). A year later during the same month, the Russian patent agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group when it tried to copyright the Bitcoin name .\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been angry about the recent news as prior attempts have infuriated bitcoiners in the past. Back in 2015 the nonprofit organization the Bitcoin Foundation published a plea to individuals and businesses asking them not to copyright the term Bitcoin.\n“The Bitcoin Foundation believes that the term “Bitcoin” alone should not be the intellectual property of any individual or entity,” explained the organization back in January 2015.\nRather, it is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,”“yen,” etc. The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.\nWhat do you think about the UK company trademarking the name Bitcoin and sending cease and desist letters to those who attempt to use the name?

Successfully Trademarks the Name ‘Bitcoin’ Posted on by Startup365\nMultiple reports and public filings have shown a UK-based firm called ‘ A.B.C. IPHoldings South West ’ has successfully acquired a trademark for the name ‘Bitcoin’. According to a merchant on Etsy, IP-Holdings sent a cease and desist order because they were selling Bitcoin-themed t-shirts.\nAlso read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ UK Company Successfully Copyrights the Name ‘Bitcoin’\nThis week cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out the name ‘Bitcoin’ had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK on December 22, 2017. The news came as a shock to one merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was told to stop his operations or be held liable in a court of law. The letter states :\nIt has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994.\nContacting the company is difficult as there is very little information on the London-headquartered firm called IP-Holdings — minus one other patented IP product called ‘Westworld.’ The trademark itself, filed this past December, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as adult clothing, infants’ clothing, shoes, headbands, socks, and nearly everything that can be manufactured into a product. Trademark number ‘UK00003279106 Bitcoin’ was officially registered into the IPO’s records on April 13, 2018. The “BITCOIN” IPO trademark filed on December 22, 2017. Other Attempts to Trademark the Bitcoin Name Have Failed\nThe UK filing seems to be the first successful trademark using the name Bitcoin as there have been other undertakings in the past. Back in March of 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the company Urban Trend’s attempt to trademark the name Bitcoin (Reg 86135516 ). A year later during the same month, the Russian patent agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group when it tried to copyright the Bitcoin name .\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been angry about the recent news as prior attempts have infuriated bitcoiners in the past. Back in 2015 the nonprofit organization the Bitcoin Foundation published a plea to individuals and businesses asking them not to copyright the term Bitcoin.\n“The Bitcoin Foundation believes that the term “Bitcoin” alone should not be the intellectual property of any individual or entity,” explained the organization back in January 2015.\nRather, it is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,” “yen,” etc. The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.\nWhat do you think about the UK company trademarking the name Bitcoin and sending cease and desist letters to those who attempt to use the name?

If BTC/USD breaks the $7,000-7,200 support, there could be heavy declines.\nThis past week, there were heavy losses from the $8,500 swing high in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke two important support levels at $8,150 and $7,900.\nThe decline was such that the price even broke the $7,600 pivot level. It traded close to the $7,000 level and found support near $7,200.\nA low was formed at $7,220 before the price started consolidating in a range. It traded a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,220 low.\nHowever, buyers failed to gain momentum above the $7,600 pivot level. Therefore, the price is in a downtrend below $7,600.

The cryptocurrency will trade “at least” above $10,000 by the year’s end, he added. Bogart is a partner at major VC firm Blockchain Capital , and was reportedly the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin and blockchain, authoring a highly regarded blockchain industry report. Bitcoin has now seen three weeks in the negative, its “longest running streak of losses since September 2017,” as CNBC’s interview intro noted. Despite this, Bogart outlined a bullish forecast for the long term, saying that: “The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occuring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk .” Bogart suggested however that many altcoins are likely “overvalued” and “have significant headwind,” emphasizing the dangers of relative valuation. He drew a parallel between the ICO boom in late 2017 – early 2018 and the dot-com boom of the early 2000s, warning that many crypto tokens are “over-promising and under-delivering.” Bogart said he would sell alts such as Cardano , TRON , IOTA and NEO , but was “neutral” and would hold Ethereum , Ripple , Bitcoin Cash and EOS . “I’m very constructive as regards Ethereum on a long-term basis,” he said. Nonetheless, he considered that Ethereum currently has “a lot of overhang” because of the many “overvalued” tokens that are built on its platform, and suggested that Ethereum’s future will be closely correlated to the future development of the ICO space. Bogart also noted that this has been the first sustained bear market where nobody has suggested the “end of Bitcoin.” He suggested that the reality of a deeper institutionalization of the crypto space is securing the long term “story,” and is “overall positive” for Bitcoin’s future. He also said that ongoing turbulence in the traditional financial sector, such as recent national fiat currency crises , is reinforcing Bitcoin’s use cases. “Could Bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now?

So how can I spend money in addresses in derived addresses in HD wallet? :( – Man Manam Jan 18 at 17:47 I think you’ve mixed something up slightly, you cannot use an xpub to derive private keys, to do that you need the xpriv. I just took a look at BlockCypher’s wallet API docs ( blockcypher.com/dev/bitcoin/… ), and it seems they use a different derivation scheme than the standard BIP32 layout.

There are numerous discussions regarding Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash fees in this regard. It now seems the average Bitcoin transaction cost is lower than that of BCH. As is usually the case, such a temporary snapshot can look very different in a few hours.\nThe Bitcoin Fees in Perspective When directly comparing BTC with BCH fees , it seems there is no real contest. The cost of a Bitcoin Cash transaction has been far lower compared to the world's leading cryptocurrency. In fact, the BHC costs have been relatively flat for quite some time now. Bitcoin's fees, on the other hand, are erratic as they have always been.\nBitcoin fees have been lower than BCash fees in the last 6 hours. pic.twitter.com/XAll68BbC9\n— Ben Verret (@verretor) May 27, 2018\nHowever, temporary snapshots often tell a different story. The Tweet by Ven Verret shows the BTC fees are lower than BCH in a six-hour period. An interesting development, albeit one that only tells a small part of the story. The screenshot itself shows these fees for Bitcoin have spiked just an hour or two prior. Why that sudden increase took place, remains a bit unclear at this time.\nThis doesn't mean Bitcoin has suddenly become cheaper to use. When timing transactions correctly, that may be the case temporarily. Additionally, users with patience can still send transactions at 1 Satoshi per byte. It may take several hours to confirm, but it is another interesting option worth exploring. When looking at the bigger picture, however, BCH remains the cheaper option by quite a margin.\nThe Debate Continues As is usually the case when trends like these are pointed out, the public backlash is palpable. Bitcoin Cash supporters do not take kindly to this development. However, they also point out how their average TX fee is 0.24 cents or lower. That is quite cheap, although others will argue this point. The overall use of the BCH network compared to Bitcoin is very different.\nThe bigger question is how this situation will evolve. More specifically, there is a growing need for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. The Lightning Network may effectively provide that functionality. Thanks to the growth in payment channels, it seems this logical development may occur pretty soon. Even so, the technology is still in beta testing, and an \"official\" launch has not yet been announced.\nDevelopments like these are interesting to keep an eye on. However, keeping the bigger picture in mind needs to be a top priority first and foremost. That picture clearly shows Bitcoin has the highest market cap and Bitcoin Cash remains the altcoin. It also shows Bitcoin has higher fees in general, and that situation may not change soon. As such, the current status quo between BC and BCH will not swing in favor of either currency.\nThe post Bitcoin Fees Temporarily Less Than BCH, Can This Continue? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ven verret", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben verret", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:29:49.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1c798ca5a35ba23467243b6da1503d7fa9a123a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbcPwyPlglJx9ZXMo3oadvE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin price effect on Altcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin price effect on Altcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T18:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1c798ca5a35ba23467243b6da1503d7fa9a123a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbcPwyPlglJx9ZXMo3oadvE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bontkoli01", "published": "2018-05-27T18:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price effect on Altcoin", "text": "Bitcoin price dependably gives a major impact to altcoin.

The Bogdanoff twins are one of the many memes to have taken over the crypto community, providing welcome relief amidst the growing gloom.\nAlso read: BTCC to Launch New Exchange Platform in June When the Market Dies, the Memes Flourish Pepe Satoshi\nIt would be easy to write memes off as the frivolous, ephemera that they are. And it’s true that most crypto memes are so esoteric and asinine as to defy explanation. How to account for the phenomenon that is “bog posting” for example, a bizarre tribute to France’s plastic surgery twins who reputedly have the power to crash the crypto markets with one phone call? Or pink wojak, the permanently distressed trader whose every move goes against him – often thanks to a well-timed call from the bogs themselves?\nFor anyone new to crypto, the meaning behind the memes and shitposting must be an utter mystery. Even those raised in the crypto trenches would struggle to explain why or how such characters came to be synonymous with the constant pain of being at the mercy of bitcoin whales who manipulate the market. All they could tell you, if pressed, is that in times of turmoil, memes make everything better. The world may be burning and the markets dumping, but so long as there are exploitable memes to share, the pain is bearable. Rare Pepes, Pink Wojaks and Telegram Stickers Galore Pepe Andreas.\nIn crypto, as on the web at large, many of the memes originate from the home of dank memetics – 4chan – before permeating mainstream culture. The forum’s /biz/ message board has been pivotal in spawning much of the content that’s come to be synonymous with crypto trading. /Biz/, whose unofficial motto is “Buy high, sell low”, has been particularly prolific when it comes to churning out pink wojaks, with one Twitter account dedicated to sharing the best of the bunch.\nAnd then there’s Pepe the frog, who’s never far away when the subject of 4chan memes is broached. One of the most popular dapps over the past week has been the Peppedapp , a place to “Share, buy and sell the dankest memes on Ethereum”. In the last seven days it has been responsible for thousands of transactions involving hundreds of ether. Many traders have been steering clear of the markets amidst lingering uncertainty, but the Peppedapp Telegram group , home to 1,400 collectors of rare Pepes, has been a hub of activity as traders exchange limited edition cards and speculate how much the McAfee card might be worth by June. The Bogdanoff Telegram sticker pack He Sold? “Bogged” Crypto Cobain\nCrypto was geeky from the outset, and over the years its arcane rituals, celebrations and jargon have become embedded in its culture and as immutable as the genesis block itself. It doesn’t really matter why “Fit Vitalik”, “Carol trying to use the Lightning Network”, or “The Bogs” came to be. All that matters is when your portfolio doesn’t bear looking at and there are no ICOs worth FOMOing into, crypto will remain as relevant and irresistible as ever. It’s not just the best music that’s made in tough times: so are the best memes. Sure, they’re stupid as hell. But they’re also part of the fabric that makes cryptocurrency so compelling.\nWhat are your favorite crypto memes?
