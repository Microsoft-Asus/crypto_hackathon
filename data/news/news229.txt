The index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Ethereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects. Bitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13. Blockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5. The index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly. The sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62. China in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.

Following the success of conferences in Amsterdam, Miami, Chicago, and Los Angeles, lots of bitcoin talk of senior executives will travel to London once more on September 25 & 26, 2017 to discuss the brilliant future of Bitcoin and Blockchain, probably the most successful virtual currency in the world.

The community of Blockchain & Bitcoin Conferences, organized by Smile-Expo, has already united nine cities in Europe and Asia: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kyiv, Stockholm, Prague, Tallinn, Valletta, Almaty, and now Cyprus's Limassol. It is for us a pleasure to announce that XXII Worldwide Convention on Organic Synthesis (22-ICOS) can be held in Florence on September sixteen-21 2018.

The meeting will comply with a conventional ICOS program developed in session with theInternational Advisory Board. The particular consideration will likely be given to ICOs, initial coin providing, revealed in one of the shows of the primary block (variations between ICOs and enterprise financing) and in the panel dialogue devoted to the regulation of tokensales and clear alerts of rip-off tasks. In 2017, Blockchain & Bitcoin Convention are taking place in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Russia, Estonia, Malta, Cyprus and a spread of other international locations. First, ICOs are a poised to be a disruptive pressure in the international tech and finance ecosystems (here's a great bitcoin talk weblog publish on Why Tokens Are Eating The World \"). Second, a comply with up name was needed to go in to better detail about ICOs, from the attitude of each firms (who ought to take into account an ICO, what are the keys to a successful ICO, what are the downsides to an ICO…), and from investors (how do you place completely different ICOs in to context, what's one of the simplest ways to purchase and trade ICOs …). To answer these questions, and others, we have put collectively another nice panel of thought leaders who've all been a part of successful ICOs. One of the keynote speakers of Blockchain & Bitcoin Convention will be the fundamental blockchain and cryptocurrency lobbyist within the Swedish Parliament Mathias Sundin. ICOS entered it is eighth 12 months, the previous conferences had been efficiently organized in Kuala Lumpur (2010, 2012 & 2014), Langkawi in 2011, Kuching in 2013, Malacca in 2015 and Langkawi in 2016.

Another is Waves, itself a platform for ICO tokens, which raised over $sixteen million. Bradley previously led analysis for CoinDesk, the world chief in news and knowledge on digital currencies, and architected their State of Blockchain report and highlight examine on ICOs. The Nordic ICOS Symposium is supposed to happen each second 12 months alternating with the ICOS Science Convention. With ICOs, there is is the extra element of the token economics. Liquidity in digital tokens - how these are traded for different digital currencies, and then into fiat currency by means of a digital trade. The intention of ICOS (as opposed to the numerous nationwide societies for identify-study) is the advancement, representation and co-ordination of title-analysis on an international stage and in an interdisciplinary context. In this sense, use of the shared ledger for ICOs is a regtech\" greater than a fintech. In doing so, they're rejecting the notion that the cash\" offered in ICOs are merely tokens to entry a game or a service, and treating them as an alternative as investments.

Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, explained to CNBC :\nCryptocurrency is very controversial, but it’s really here to stay. And the underlying [blockchain] technology is really fundamental to the types of companies that people are building right now. As such, investment bankers are doing their clients a serious disservice by failing to properly advise them on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related investments.

Start to understand why there are different cryptocurrencies.\nFor example:\nWhat’s the difference between a payments coin, like bitcoin or ethereum? All of these things are different, so advisors have to spend the time so they can actually help their clients make sense of this.\nStill, Sokolin doesn’t recommend going all-in on cryptocurrency.

Source: AFP PHOTO / Yuri CORTEZ Mesh networking: Chat (and trade Bitcoin) in the back of beyond\nBy Joe Green | 18 May, 2018\nAFTER hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico last year, around half of the island’s cell towers were rendered out of action. Nearly as vital to modern life as water and power, returning the country’s wireless network to a viable state was a priority for the local authorities – in fact, lack of cell connectivity hampered short-term relief efforts considerably.\nNatural occurences like Maria are one thing, but man-made disasters such as aggressive attacks on infrastructure can have grave consequences on business and finance. As well as cellphone networks, a malicious attacker may well target ISPs’ service as well as local wifi networks. It’s into this situation that mesh networking comes into its own.\nTo a certain extent, the internet itself is a mesh network: an array of nodes with protocols designed to find the fastest route from point A to B and navigate around slower or non-existent points en route.\nBut when we talk about mesh computing today, what we are specifically referring to is a peer-to-peer network which enables data interchange by the users and/or independent nodes. In brief, each user of mesh computing technology becomes a route point, as well as a sender and receiver of data. A post shared by GoTenna (@gotenna) on May 16, 2018 at 7:51am PDT\nIn the event of a disaster, mesh networking participants can, therefore, communicate over distances limited only by the position of each other. If person A wants to communicate with person B, they can do so directly (if in range of one another) or via parties C, D, E, then to B, and so forth. Those nodes simply pass on data neutrally, relaying messages back and forth. Choosing which nodes to use falls to the underlying protocols of the network, much in the same way as internet traffic hops between routers.\nThe principle of decentralization as in mesh computing is nothing new. Cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralized ledger – Bitcoin has 10,000 nodes or more across the globe, each one with (eventually) an identical, immutable record of every transaction.\nSimilarly, when files are exchanged via bit-torrenting, multiple sources all contribute towards a single request for data, each supplier offering a disparate part of a whole which is assembled by the requester. The fastest data transfers are accorded priority, meaning that bit-torrenting large files, for instance, is speedier and more reliable than a download from one site.\nMesh networking also has its uses in areas with traditionally poor coverage by cell networks, such as rural regions or remote wildernesses. At the moment, for instance, war correspondents or those exploring distant locales may have to rely on expensive satellite phone technology to call for help if there’s (literally) trouble. Satoko Omata | 14 May, 2018\nWith a mesh network, members of a party, from lead mountaineers to base camp (as an example) could remain in communication with the outside world, as data is passed seamlessly from one party member to the other. At the end(s) of the chain, the last user’s general internet connectivity could, therefore, be shared by all.\nDecentralized networks in their various guises may not be universally popular, however. Many large ISPs today are also media creators, through business association or umbrella companies. As a result, some users have found their bit-torrenting activities throttled; the assumption is that bit torrents are being used to distribute illegal, pirated files.\nThe end of net neutrality in the US has also opened up a broader market for mesh networking enthusiasts, and the movement indeed often affiliates itself to freedom-of-speech and independent communication lobbies.\nWhether it’s enabling disaster relief, ensuring explorers never get cut off from communications, or letting outdoor activity fans to message each other, mesh computing, like cryptocurrencies, has the ability to severely disrupt a cozy effective-monopoly of large ISPs and media companies. We are excited to announce the forthcoming release of TxTenna, made in collaboration with @SamouraiWallet\nThis app will allow users to make bitcoin transactions over a decentralized, off-grid network! https://t.co/W5FqapaNtb\n— goTenna (@gotenna) May 14, 2018\nThe only way to prevent mesh computing’s use on mobile devices (and/or permanent geographic nodes) would be to prevent cellphones from piggybacking Bluetooth or wireless access points for remote access to data networks. That would seem unlikely under any circumstances.\nWith startups producing mechanisms by which Bitcoin can be traded over a mesh , freedom-of-information enthusiasts can escape all type of control by large bodies: banks and/or ISPs. And for the rest of us, we may well see the end of the ISP and the traditional cellphone tower provider. Perhaps soon, both will go the same way as the vaguely ridiculous telephone landlines provided by terrestrial telecoms providers which still inexplicably abound.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi16JKtnT6Z/", "https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://inthemesh.com/archive/txtenna-decentralizing-last-mile-bitcoin/", "https://t.co/W5FqapaNtb", "https://twitter.com/gotenna/status/996141168651132930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.imeshyou.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuri co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T05:45:55.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cc6141a8024569ba5889538b3c13e278b69d97e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQVWNJAgIXT7vfDr_9t9Dvj8rHdfLdAEGc6jm8odciUUTNBzMI7m5.kqTQm7Bfweujt8ybJ1gjxrTChU4LaL97ND.6R1QtPaekxrziPPdscwDuBJi6v106g2j_smqDz7n0sRJBqbhYRSEgyhnF5SNX.BDvDVGCQZv5Ew2KMkChCP6Fv2w.Eppc3Dru2bMHe3c-", "site_full": "melodyintrance.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://melodyintrance.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin continue to fall – Motley Fool Australia – The truth is in here", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin continue to fall – Motley Fool Australia", "title_full": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin continue to fall – Motley Fool Australia", "published": "2018-05-18T03:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cc6141a8024569ba5889538b3c13e278b69d97e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQVWNJAgIXT7vfDr_9t9Dvj8rHdfLdAEGc6jm8odciUUTNBzMI7m5.kqTQm7Bfweujt8ybJ1gjxrTChU4LaL97ND.6R1QtPaekxrziPPdscwDuBJi6v106g2j_smqDz7n0sRJBqbhYRSEgyhnF5SNX.BDvDVGCQZv5Ew2KMkChCP6Fv2w.Eppc3Dru2bMHe3c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Peter", "published": "2018-05-18T03:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin continue to fall – Motley Fool Australia", "text": "\nMotley Fool Australia Crypto update: Bitcoin , Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin continue to fall\nMotley Fool Australia\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) price is down 1% since this time yesterday to US$8,229.56 per coin, reducing its market capitalisation to US$140.2 billion.

Ver is considered one of the most astute investors in the cryptocurrency space, having first bought BTC coin at $1. Speaking from Bangkok, he spoke on the recently held network upgrade, and the direction of BCH vs. BTC over the coming 12 months and beyond.\nHis opening remarks sought to clarify misinformation around the event, which he said is not a fork but an update, en route to making Bitcoin Cash the de facto default currency for payments and ultimately store of value.\nVer described the update as an essential step in making room for more people to use Bitcoin Cash as a currency, which he forecast would flow from the ease of use, increased block size, lower transaction fees and faster processing times.\nReferring to examples closer to home, Ver said BCH was already popular in Thailand, and could already be used for a range of everyday transactions, including buying meals or paying for beer. Further, he spoke of BCH already being used in a range of ecommerce settings, as an example of the direction the cryptocurrency is heading in.\nBitcoin BCH has its fair share of critics, mostly devout BTC coin investors who sense the tide is turning. Ver pointed out that BCH is already more valuable than BTC coin was a year ago, ahead of its strong rally over the closing months of the year.\nYet compared to the BTC coin, which has a number of practical difficulties that make it unsuitable as a currency, BCH is already scalable as a solution for payments and ecommerce. Ver said that like what he’s doing as CEO of Bitcoin.com, a number of business are also “building their new products on top of Bitcoin Cash.”\n“The economic path that Bitcoin Cash is on is the one that led to Bitcoin’s original success,” Ver told the news outlet. “I’m incredibly bullish on Bitcoin Cash for the exact same reasons I was bullish on Bitcoin back in 2011.”\nSlamming BTC as slow, unreliable, and heading in a completely different direction from the original vision of Bitcoin, he told CNBC the shift towards greater adoption of BCH was already well underway, citing support from the new Winklevoss exchange and countless others.\nDespite the name calling and vitriol from BTC Core supporters online, Ver predicted that Bitcoin Cash would at least double by the end of 2018. Conceding BTC would also continue to grow, he put the growth prospects for BTC coin at around 10-30% over the same period.\nGiven Ver’s status as an influential voice in the Bitcoin community, his comments come as a confirmation of Bitcoin Cash’s success and continuing growth, relative to the more established BTC coin. At the inaugural CoinGeek Conference, Ver is joining other thought leaders and experts in the cryptocurrency space to discuss the network upgrade along with other topics related to eCommerce, advancements in the BCH technology and the future of the crypto space. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/15/roger-ver-bitcoin-jesus-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed drake", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bangkok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:47:46.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12a7ceaf1c99476154b23756cbbd8a4bb3520783", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRvB.Xo7TA4LstsAiuXQnxaDHiFmUVSkCnzD5_z9sqkpknb5Ol6CwLv4CGIcLQBHFBh3WB3eoyMbaddAHoZfoQPUudK4qOUopM-", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/advfn/Xrhn", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "BB's Stock Haven", "title": "Threeflight: TVOG hires \"Father\" of Bitcoin to be director", "title_full": "Threeflight: TVOG hires \"Father\" of Bitcoin to be director", "published": "2018-05-18T03:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/images/ihub_fb_logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5565, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12a7ceaf1c99476154b23756cbbd8a4bb3520783", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRvB.Xo7TA4LstsAiuXQnxaDHiFmUVSkCnzD5_z9sqkpknb5Ol6CwLv4CGIcLQBHFBh3WB3eoyMbaddAHoZfoQPUudK4qOUopM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Threeflight: TVOG hires \"Father\" of Bitcoin to be director", "text": "Post # of 4295835 TVOG hires \"Father\" of Bitcoin to be director of Blockchain and M & A development.

All are in the advanced stages of discussions moving towards closing, or in one case, agreements are already being negotiated to close. They are aimed at M & A (Merger & Acquisition) and JV (Joint Venture) agreements, and the first completed closing will be announced in an upcoming press release as soon as prudently possible. This undertaking, along with all of the upcoming blockchain transactions, will be structured in a way so that the company can benefit from the growth of the blockchain technology sector while strategically applying it to the bitumen and related supply chain, shipping, and infrastructure segments. Management believes that by making strategic acquisitions, investments, and mutually beneficial alliances, it can have a competitive advantage in its market places and be able to help shape the blockchain technology expansion currently taking place across various industries. In addition to the pending blockchain press releases, TVOG expects to make announcements soon regarding a new Board of Directors and more management additions, Form 10 resubmission, expansion/shipping contract details, M & A’s, JV’s, an updated website, and a host of other company events as the company builds upon its initial bitumen shipping asset purchase.

Min goes after Porter for accepting large contributions from Washington insiders and after Forde for large contributors from special interests associated with Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency.\nOne could argue it’s a logical response to attacks from the non-endorsed candidates still in the race for Congress and fair play.\nExcept for one tiny detail.\nMin associates Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency with drug crimes and human trafficking. And that’s it.\nI just about spit my coffee when I heard this. It’s a misrepresentation at best. Cash, wire transfers, illicit products are also used as currency on the Silk road and the Dark Web. But there’s more to Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain than bad stuff.\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency — of which there are many. Digital “money” that changes in value much like a share of stock does. There is not a lot of regulation around this technology yet frankly because legislators don’t really understand it. But the market will force some rules on cryptocurrency sooner than later, and have. But Crytocurrency and the Blockchain technology used to make this work are the tech building blocks on which billions of dollars in investment globally will transform transactions and wealth in weeks, months, and decades to come.\nCryptocurrency could if fact become a global universal currency at some point and the entire concept is only about five years old. Bitcoin and Blockchain are a global $700 million market which offers incredible opportunities for great paying jobs. See this story in CNBC earlier this month which is positive about cryptocurrency. Now imagine these jobs in CD-45 where there’s a lot of financial institutions, insurance and security technology companies. Could be great news for the area’s economy.\nHere’s how it works\nBitcoin is peer-to-peer payment system based on open source software with payments recorded in a public ledger. A unit of account is called a Bitcoin which is used as a means of payment for work. Bitcoin users confirm and record payments into this public ledger which can also be used to pay for products, money and services where users can exchange Bitcoins. Transaction fees can be charged after they have placed a bitcoin wallet on a computer, tablet or smartphone — or even a website. These fees are less than fees credit card companies charge. Once you have a Bitcoin wallet, you can create a Bitcoin address and share this address with friends or business associates to send or receive payments. Blockchain technology, which is used for a lot more than cryptocurrency, is a shared public ledger that confirms every transaction in the Blockchain network. This is how Bitcoin wallets can ascertain balances and new transactions owned by the spender. Cryptography protects the Blockchain network. When a transaction is made, there’s a transfer of Bitcoin value that’s added to the blockchain where the wallets use a unique piece of encrypted data called a private key which electronically signs the transaction and offers technical proof the Bitcoin has come from the owner of the Bitcoin wallet. The private key cannot be changed once its issued and transactions are confirmed after a short time through a process called mining. Now the very nature of Bitcoin makes it the currency of choice for hackers who engage in Ransomware lockouts. There was a police department in New England that paid a hacker in Bitcoin after being locked out of its own network. The city of Atlanta had parts of critical applications locked out by ransomware. And I’m certain sophisticated drug and human trafficking operations also use cryptocurrency for transactions. But criminal elements also use cash, wire transfers to offshore accounts, money laundering from business and banking enterprises. Cybercrime is a global $6 trillion a year problem by 2019 according to Garter, an industry analyst. Think of Bitcoin as a form of payment for services and products that’s growth dramatically and businesses who transact in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have fees that are dramatically lower than what credit card processors and commercial banks charge. One study suggests that while Bitcoin is best suited for small purchases now, eventually Bitcoin and cryptocurrency can be seen as an alternative to gold as a safe investment. Buyer beware on this and do your homework. Forde, on the White House’s technology team during the Obama administration, is an expert in Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency and routinely brief President Obama on key developments. This is likely why Forde is getting contributions from this industry.

Stronger selling pressure could take it lower to the next downside targets also shown by the Fib extension tool Technical indicators are suggesting that bears could stay in control of bitcoin price action for a bit longer.\nBitcoin price has completed its correction and is on its way to test the downside targets marked by the Fib extension tool.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that selling pressure could persist. These moving averages have also held as dynamic resistance on a quick pullback and might continue to keep gains in check.\nPrice is currently testing the 38.2% extension at $8,000 and a move lower could lead to a test of the 50% extension at $7,316. Stronger selling momentum could take bitcoin price down to the 61.8% extension at $6,694 near the swing low or the 78.6% extension at $5,808. The full extension is located at $4,680.7.\nRSI is pointing down to signal that sellers are in control of the game and could take bitcoin price for further losses. Stochstic is also heading south but is dipping into oversold levels to reflect some exhaustion and hint at a possible return in bullish momentum. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nIf the 38.2% extension is enough to keep losses at bay, bitcoin could still have a shot at forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This would be a classic reversal signal, hinting that price is done with the drop and that a longer-term uptrend is in the works. Price has yet to break past the neckline at $10,000 for this to happen though.\nIt would take a really strong market catalyst to spur such a strong climb, especially since the $10,000 handle has held as a ceiling for quite some time. So far, investors seem more cautious on the rejection at key inflection points.

Approximately 200,000 Dutch students are estimated to have taken the OVW exam, a mandatory test for students seeking tertiary education in the Netherlands, which included five bitcoin-themed questions. Dutch High School Examinations Feature Bitcoin-Themed Maths Questions\nAccording to a rough translation of the examination paper circulating on Reddit , students were given the following question introduction:\n“Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It has existed since January 1st, 2009, and can be used as payment method in webstores and for other online services. Bitcoin is not, like standard money, made by a central bank. Instead, all bitcoin that exist are created by having computers participate in solving specific mathematical problems. This works as follows: everyone can run special software on his or her computer that participates in solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. Because it was the case that in 2014 such a problem is solved every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins were created every 10 minutes. On January 1st, there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoin.”\nFollowing from the preceding introduction, students were asked to solve five different mathematical problems. The questions asked that students “calculate in what year the amount of bitcoin exceeded 18 million,” “calculate from which year on the reward will be less than one bitcoin,” “determine the maximal amount of bitcoin that can be in circulation,” in addition to posing addition problems based on the formula used to employed to solve the aforementioned questions. Netherlands Warming to Cryptocurrency\nThe test has been offered to students following increasing recognition of cryptocurrency on the part of Holland’s institutions.\nDuring March , the Court of Amsterdam determined that bitcoin possesses “properties of wealth” whilst adjudicating a civil rights case between an individual seeking repayment from an unfulfilled contract pertaining to bitcoin mining. The court concluded that “bitcoin represents a value and is transferable” and “thus shows characteristics of a property right. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is, therefore, to be regarded as a claim that qualifies for verification.”\nEarlier this month, the ambassador of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, Rob van Gijzel, presented a national blockchain research agenda , which had been commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. The ministry had created a designated committee, TopTeam ICT, tasked with analyzing the potential legal, economic, and ethical implications of distributed ledger technology in the Netherlands.\nDo you think that more schools across the world will seek to integrate themes pertinent to bitcoin into examinations as cryptocurrency adoption grows?

One researcher may deserve some credit for owning up after his latest Bitcoin forecast failed to pan out.\nThomas Lee\nPhotographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted on May 7 that Bitcoin would rally during Consensus, the cryptocurrency conference this week that drew thousands of enthusiasts (and some Lamborghinis ) to a packed hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\nBitcoin didn’t rally. In fact, cryptocurrencies slumped about 10 percent during the past week, Lee admitted in a report to clients Friday.\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction,” he wrote. “And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.”\nRead more: Crypto wealth sinks $45 billion while Bitcoin bros party in NYC\nSo what went wrong? Lee said the crypto industry still needs more clarity from regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as increased adoption by traditional companies.\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Lee said. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.”\nFundstrat still expects Bitcoin to be worth $25,000 by the end of this year.\n— With assistance by Andrea Tan, and Blake Schmidt\nLISTEN TO ARTICLE 1:37 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "crypto bull tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chris goodney/bloomberg thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee photographer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "midtown manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:04:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8321b717eaf7d3b9ab58e191f74c314d332c6a7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_54V2nqxkwV4uQ2FLkr2qNT2edpiJIgCtHOfZZjf.Iy7b5eQnou7P629sEDvZxNEMRViidfcOdmZlqGIgfhU0SqdM_IRjdzC8-", "site_full": "www.etf.com", "site": "etf.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "", "title": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs", "title_full": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/01/11/104941023-RTX3WCTM.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 67452, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8321b717eaf7d3b9ab58e191f74c314d332c6a7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_54V2nqxkwV4uQ2FLkr2qNT2edpiJIgCtHOfZZjf.Iy7b5eQnou7P629sEDvZxNEMRViidfcOdmZlqGIgfhU0SqdM_IRjdzC8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cinthia Murphy", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs", "text": "ETF Markets Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs The ARK Innovation ETF has been on a tear and recently took home ETF of the Year honors at an ETF.com annual event.

Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com ETF.com Edgar Su | Reuters A woman pays for her coffee with cryptocurrency at Ducatus cafe, the first cashless cafe that accepts cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, in Singapore December 21, 2017.\nJust over a month ago, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) took home ETF.com's \"ETF Of The Year\" award for delivering on its purpose of serving up access to disruptive technology in 2017, and doing so really well.\nCrucial to that recognition was its unique allocation to bitcoin. For much of the fund's history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin — ARKK's internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF ( ARKW ).\nMore from ETF.com:\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust ( GBTC ), was a major driver behind both these funds' returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere's the ETFs' rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC's, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs' big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the \"complicated decision\" to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the \"merits\" of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin — as measured by GBTC — rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.) show chapters 10:19 AM ET Fri, 18 May 2018 | 10:16\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF — many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring — investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\n— By Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com .

This time, the currency is trading for roughly $8,100 – a $200 drop since yesterday’s $8,300 mark.\nSince the beginning of the week, bitcoin has repeatedly been hit with price slumps. The Coindesk Consensus Conference – which lasted from Monday to Wednesday – ultimately failed to garner any lasting publicity for the currency, and following a brief spike to $8,800, the currency has incurred a four-day series of $200 to $300 slips.\nThe good news is that bitcoin has slumped to $8,000 several times in the past and always jumped back. Analysts suggest that the coin has developed solid support at this level, and newfound defense against ongoing resistance.\nSenior market analyst for E-Toro Matt Greenspan has examined bitcoin’s long-term trendline. He’s concluded that the currency’s strongest support level is at $7,100, and says that while any level can snap, bitcoin isn’t likely to drop below this position in the immediate future.\nWhile $7,100 isn’t anything to be excited about, it’s still better than where the currency stood last March (we’re sure investors would like to avoid grazing $6,600 again).\nCryptocurrency investor Marius Rupsys is still advising people to stay cautious when deciding on which cryptocurrencies to trade. When discussing bitcoin, he mentioned:\n“There might be some support at $8,000, but any price level can be broken. I would sit on the sidelines to see where the price goes next.”\nInterestingly, the price of Ethereum has jumped significantly over the last 48 hours, and investors are now turning their attention to the bitcoin competitor and the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Why? Because ether is garnering newfound respect in China – a country that outlawed residences from trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges back in September. The country is now ranking the world’s largest cryptocurrencies with its latest index, and Ethereum has landed the number one spot.\nIt’s an unexpected twist – especially considering bitcoin sits at the 13th position. It’s disappointing for the father of cryptocurrency, but impressive for the second-in-command. Many investors see this as a huge sign that China – a country once hostile towards cryptocurrencies – is keeping an open mind regarding changes in the trading market.\nDaniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School says the move is “basically a government-led assessment of blockchain experts which will be based on feedback and reviews from academics, industry operators and governmental agencies.”\nHe added:\n“The reason why this is important is twofold. First, it makes it clear that a massive market like China is openly considering blockchain technology to boost productivity. Second, it relaxes the view that the Chinese government is openly against cryptocurrencies and their use.”\nCEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinMetro Kevin Murcko claims that China’s position on crypto is adapting, as authorities are realizing the country must be ahead in the digital economy era to qualify as a global superpower.\n“China wants to be the frontrunner in the digital economy era,” he commented. “And as the nation readies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it sees cryptocurrency and blockchain – a technology with enormous potential to remove pain points and inefficiencies – as an economic game changer.” About The Author ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt greenspan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "merkle pin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coindesk consensus conference", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T10:03:27.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "915624de48073d4f3e4457124a4a43c6f7426828", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyMLct9S5.c2mQn30o4aghs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "title_full": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "915624de48073d4f3e4457124a4a43c6f7426828", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyMLct9S5.c2mQn30o4aghs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nCryptoTab work is based on a smart system, which dynamically switches mining between several cryptocurrencies for increasing profit up to 4x relative to continued mining of the only one cryptocurrency. Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The event was filled with movers and shakers from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ecosystem, alongside hundreds of BCH supporters looking to change the way the world’s money works.\nAlso Read: 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins Coingeek Conference 2018: Spreading the Word of Bitcoin Cash Adoption in Hong Kong\nCoingeek wrapped up its Bitcoin Cash-focused conference that aimed at spreading the message of the many benefits BCH has to offer. The event was held in Hong Kong, at the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, and had a wide variety of industry innovators from company’s like Purse.io, Bitmain, Yours, Centbee, Handcash, Nchain, Lokad, Bitcoin.com, and more. Moreover, attendees listened to keynote presentations from Ryan X Charles , Jihan Wu, Dr. Craig Wright, Roger Ver , Joannes Vermorel, Vin Armani, Steven Bower, and Jimmy Nguyen among many special guests. Lorien Gamaroff CEO of Centbee discusses better wallets and payment solutions. What consumers and merchants need for a Bitcoin Cash world. Bitcoin Cash Powering Online Commerce\nThe event kicked off with Nchain’s Jimmy Nguyen who discussed the latest Nchain BCH-focused endeavor called ‘Bcommerce.’ Nguyen’s talk called ‘A Bcomm World: How Bitcoin Cash will Power the future of ‘Bcommerce,’ got the crowd fired up over how BCH proponents plan to spread mass adoption. The concept of Bcommerce aims to provide a global payment system on-chain, with low commission fees, and fast transactions. Nguyen details how the firm is researching and developing on-chain techniques for Bitcoin Cash, security improvements, better user interfaces and APIs, and most of all merchant adoption. Compared to Swift — It is Wonderful to Use Cryptocurrencies as a Payment Method\nAfter Nguyen’s speech on Bcommerce, the Coingeek crowd was greeted by the CEO of Bitmain Technologies Jihan Wu. Mr. Wu’s presentation called “The Future of Crypto Economy and Bitcoin Cash,” described how proponents can further bolster BCH adoption. Mr. Wu also discussed the subject of initial coin offerings (ICOs) likely in part because BCH may have the ability to produce colored coins soon. Mr. Wu detailed to the attendees that ICO’s have become a “buzzword” and some for the wrong reasons. Bitmain Technologies CEO Jihan Wu talks about the future of the crypto economy and Bitcoin Cash.\nFurthermore, Mr. Wu said many ICOs are misleading and the cryptocurrency industry should “work closely with regulators instead of working closely with lawyers.” Moreover, Mr. Wu joined a panel with Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver, and Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright and explained how a giant tech company like Bitmain found significant flaws with the Swift banking system. As far as customers using digital assets for payments Mr. Wu thinks it is great and far more efficient than Swift.\n“It is very wonderful to use cryptocurrencies as a payment method — Basically our customers go to the banks and say they want to wire $1 million dollars to Bitmain and they can say no — You need to give them a reason, you need to give them a contract, and this and that,” explains Mr. Wu.\nBut with Bitcoin Cash you can wire the money as you wish as long as you control the private key — And the money arrives instantly and we can ship out the next day. Bitcoin ABC’s Amaury Sechet: Working to Increase Scaling Further\nFollowing the discussion with Mr. Wu, the Coingeek crowd was greeted by the Lead developer of Bitcoin ABC, Amaury Sechet , who detailed his technical vision for a global payment system. Sechet explains how Bitcoin Cash is continuing towards the original roadmap that Satoshi Nakamoto laid out in his original white paper . Bitcoin ABC’s lead developer, Amaury Sechet discusses continued BCH scaling.\nThe developer continues by explaining how BCH can already handle Paypal scale volumes, and for cheap network fees. After the BCH developers completed a successful upgrade just a few days prior, Sechet reveals to the Coingeek audience that they are “working to increase scaling further.” Bitcoin Cash follows the roadmap laid out in the original whitepaper. Purse is Launching a New Bitcoin Cash Implementation Called ‘Bcash’\nAttendees at the inaugural Coingeek conference also heard from Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright who talked about new ways to sell and trade goods with BCH in a presentation titled ‘Bitcoin’s Atomic Age.’ Participants heard from Centbee’s CEO Lorien Gamaroff and the exciting BCH wallet they are working on. Joannes Vermorel the founder of Lokad told the crowd about how proponents can overcome eCommerce hurdles with Bitcoin Cash. Purse.io announces native BCH support.\nAdditionally, Coingeek attendees heard a panel on BCH use cases from industry leaders such as Alex Gut of Handcash , Vin Armani of Cointext , Angela Holowaychuk of Ncrypt , and Steven Bower from Purse.io . Purse.io also announced a new BCH implementation called ‘bcash.’\nBower told the crowd about a new Bitcoin Cash client that will be released shortly called ‘Bcash’ that’s similar to implementations like the ABC, BU, or XT clients. Alongside this, the crowd was pleased to hear Purse.io is using BCH for native support. Overall the spirit was high in Hong Kong at the 2018 Coingeek event, and everyone who attended was quite optimistic after the successful fork a few days ago.\nDid you attend the Coingeek Conference 2018?

‘Picked out of Thin Air’\nBitcoin mining is undoubtedly an energy-intensive process, as anyone who’s ever mined the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization from home knows — but it might not be as concerning as many experts would lead you to believe.\nJonathan Koomey, a Standford lecturer who correctly illustrated how concerns over the early internet’s energy usage were dramatically unfounded, thinks researchers like de Vries are getting it wrong. Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.\nDe Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated:\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

Usually the targets attacks are Exchanges.\nOtherwise you should: Be really careful about large transactions Wait for enough confirmations Watch the known attacker’s patterns and be prepared\nWhat’s a large transaction?\nIt depends. The amounts of the observed double spending transactions are from ~8000 BTG to ~12000 BTG. So each time the attacker succeeds, the exchanges lose that amount.\nThe attacker needs to spend some money to to mine enough block to perform the 51% attack. In order to revert n blocks, the cost should be around (n+1) * 12.5 BTG, where n is the confirmations required by the exchange. A 21 block attack will cost around 262.5 BTG.\nBesides the money stolen by the double spending, the attacker may also get back close to 90% of the cost after a successful attack because the mining rewards will belong to the attacker (and can be moved after 100 more blocks have passed.)\nGiven the cost of a (successful) attack is effectively (n+1) * 12.5 * 10% BTG (or 26.25 BTG for 20 confirmations) is relatively small, the definition of a “large transaction” is mostly up to the exchange.\nHowever, the attacker also takes some risks. When the attack fails, all the cost to mine the private chain will be lost. That will be around (n+1)*12.5 BTG. If the exchange is aware of the attack, they may also freeze his account, so that all the funds will be locked inside the Exchange. A failed 21 block attack performed with a 10,000 BTG deposit where the Exchange freezes the account in time will result in a 10,262.5 BTG loss for the attacker.\nHow many confirmations should we wait?\nThe largest observed attack reverted 22 blocks. We advise raising confirmation requirements to 50 at this time, and for special attention to be paid to large transactions.\nHigher confirmations don’t merely raise the cost of the attack, but also force the attacker to spend much more time, which means more time to detect the attack and to respond.\nWhat’s the pattern of the attack?\nWe know the attacker’s address: Funds: GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft Receive mined coins: GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx\nWhen an attack begins, the attacker goes through the following steps: Begins to mine his private chain, and send his coin to himself, using enough hashrate to keep the private chain longer than the public blockchain At the same time on the public blockchain, send the same coin to an Exchange Wait for enough confirmations for the Exchange to accept the deposit Quickly sell the BTG on the exchange for other coin(s) and immediately withdraw Wait for the withdrawal of other coins to be broadcast Release the private blockchain to the network, causing a re-org where the BTG were never sent to the Exchange in the first place.\nBecause the private blockchain is longer than the public one (which is possible with more than 51% of the hashpower), the existing blocks will be reverted, and replaced by the privately mined blocks. The deposit to the Exchange will never have happened, being replaced by the transaction to the attacker himself.\nBe aware of any transaction related to the above known attacker’s addresses.

The acquisition of cryptocurrencies and tokens of ICO projects have become a substantial alternative to traditional investment options. The prospect of the given direction lies in a rapid tokenization of different assets in different sectors of the economy. Implementation of blockchain technology will change the investment environment forever and will allow purchasing of almost all types of existing assets in digital format.\nCurrently, certain amounts of crypto funds are formed, offering crypto-asset portfolios and their numbers keep growing. Accordingly, new branches require formation of support tools. These will provide the help that makes it possible to facilitate interaction between market participants and then guide them to a new level. Sponsored Links\nRecently, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, a known investor-billionaire Warren Buffet expressed his opinion regarding financial investments into cryptocurrency:\n“You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing.”\nBuffet’s position, who made his fortune with the help of traditional financial tools, is understandable. Indeed, the cryptoindustry is a branch that needs to win the trust among ordinary investors. Nevertheless, cryptotechnologies, namely, blockchain and smart-contracts can be used for creation of platforms which provide full transparency of financial operations, which is particularly relevant for any type of investment. That way, the cryptoindustry can get ahead of the traditional investment market, as it gives access to the financial sector to anyone willing to become a player in the market.\nProjects such as Blackmoon, Nousplatform, ICONOMI and Melonport are on their way to improve the current investment environment. Their activities are aimed at the creation of a functional ecosystem for interaction between crypto-funds and investors. It should be noted, that the results of their work are already visible for the cryptocommunity to see for themselves.\nKey development of Melonport project is Melon protocol, which provides digital asset management, transparent operation history and ability to invest into a fund. There is also a built-in tool, Oyente, that is used for smart-contract analysis and will be responsible for the security of users. Project developers are actively conducting comprehensive system updates thus keeping attention of the crypto community and market capitalization around $44,995,699. Gavin Wood, who was involved in the development of Ethereum and the owner of Ethcore provides support to Melonport, insisting that the system and the concept developed by the team is a significant step in the development of the cryptofund market. However, according to roadmap, full realization of the project should be expected only in the 1st quarter of 2019. At the moment, Melonport’s team is still engaged with the development of UI and underlying smart-contracts.\nFounders of the Blackmoon platform — ex-Vice President of VKontakte, Ilya Perekopsky and ex-manager of Flint Capital fund, Oleg Seydak stated, that they intend to “create a bridge between the world of real investments and a crypto-universe.”\nWhen creating a fund on the Blackmoon platform, the user has the feasibility of attracting investments, the investor, in turn, has a list of promising fiat and cryptocurrency projects to choose from and work with. Blackmoon is known for tokenizing usual investment tools, however, ways of tokenizing the assets are not yet provided on the platform. Therefore, the promised “bridge” is only a “bridge” in a long run.\nThe ICONOMI team, previously famous for creating a popular cryptoexchange, managed to attract $6 million in a span of 1 month during the ICO. At ICONOMI the comfortable investment conditions are provided by three tools: Index Fund, Performance Fund and Open Fund Management. They open up access to fund analysis, allowing them to take well-informed investment decisions, creating their own funds. And although ICONOMI does not offer the tokenization of assets and does not accept investments in fiat, the system is still very popular and right now its market capitalization is $154,183,393.\nOf all the above mentioned projects, according to several ICO-analysts, Nousplatform has all the chances to become one of the most successful service-providers, since only on this platform it’s possible to create different types of funds, tokenize assets and offer them as fund shares, as well as choosing the best funds from a rating built by a special algorithm. According to the project’s concept, access to managed crypto-assets will be provided to investors with any level of seed capital and all kinds of manipulations would be excluded owing to blockchain technology and smart-contracts. Such an approach towards the creation of decentralized funds based on blockchain technology managed to gain favor among blockchain-evangelists and crypto-investors.\nIt is worth emphasizing that Nousplatform simplifies the process of investment decision-making. This becomes possible through creation of rating and presentation of unified financial data for investment analysis of each fund on the platform. First position on the rating will be taken by funds, which combine maximum profitability, minimum risks and a positive capitalization growth.\nThe Nousplatform project enters the industry later than its predecessors, but has helped the team to integrate their experiences and mistakes, coming up with a better evolved platform. Having assessed the functionality of the platform, you can immediately notice what solutions that the other projects were missing. Investors who were not quick enough to take part in ICO Blackmoon, ICONOMI or Melonport, now have a chance to purchase Nousplatform project tokens on favourable terms. According to the information on the official website, the pre-ICO stage will be launched on May 20, 2018.\nThe first tokenized funds of partner-companies will be presented at Nousplatform during the early stages of its launch. At present, the project successfully completed the closed pre-sale stage in which the project managed to gather $550,000. Funds received are aimed at providing further development and scaling of Nousplatform. In the project’s roadmap, the team promises to release a beta-version of the platform before the ICO. We recommend you keep a close look on Nousplatform, because, if the task is completed, it can be safely said that it will create a massive influx of tokens for investors, which means that the demand will significantly outpace the supply.\nDisclaimer: BTCManager does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 percent this week to $8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes -- the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis -- predicted a surge to $50,000 by year-end.\n“While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference,” Lee wrote in a note Friday. He cited over exuberance about the prospects for rising institutional demand and lingering concerns about the regulatory framework for depressing prices.\nThis week’s slump is far from extreme by crypto standards, but the market’s resistance to Blockchain Week’s ballyhoo highlights one of the arguments often used by virtual currency pessimists -- that most people who are willing to buy the coins have already piled in.\nWhile bulls point to a vast pool of pent-up demand from professional money managers, it’s far from clear that regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere will evolve in ways that attract institutional investors. Many Wall Street pros have dismissed the market as a speculative bubble, while Warren Buffett has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nThis week’s losses may have been the result of unmet expectations surrounding Consensus 2018, said Sunny Lu, the chief executive officer of blockchain-based logistics company VeChain Tech and one of the conference speakers.\n“The quality of projects and speakers were not really as good as expected,” Lu said. “I guess people just got disappointed.”\nRead this article in : Hindi 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/crypto-wealth-falls-45-billion-but-why-bitcoin-diehards-are-still-happy/articleshow/64225574.cms&title=Crypto", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Crypto"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrea tan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blake schmidt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snoop dogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:13:31.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34d19ceedff26dfd9c3a4f4f98117a4c01f2b25a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVAz3Gt5zszQbchPY8tNadGMGgX5eEvXL2yA4jEDYMuXDtSinQQMQuYzRTvBwmyhaszvC.Zy7AF8I-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-otc-brokers.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34d19ceedff26dfd9c3a4f4f98117a4c01f2b25a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVAz3Gt5zszQbchPY8tNadGMGgX5eEvXL2yA4jEDYMuXDtSinQQMQuYzRTvBwmyhaszvC.Zy7AF8I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kai Sedgwick", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading - Bitcoin News", "text": "3162 Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading\nIf you work in cryptocurrency and are a member of Linkedin, you’re probably familiar with OTC bitcoin brokers. They’ll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy Brokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1\nAnyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to “OTC Bitcoin Broker” and you’ve done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it’s necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing “the big one”, has proliferated. How an OTC Deal Works\nSellers want to sell OTC to avoid the sort of slippage that occurs when unloading large amounts of BTC on an exchange. Whales also value their privacy, and while they are still required to undergo KYC to complete an OTC deal, their identity is only going to be shared with the broker, their attorney, and the escrow service. Normally, even the buyer won’t know the identity of the person they are buying the coins from. The seller provides “proof of satoshi” by moving a fraction of a bitcoin from the wallet they control, the buyer provides proof of funds in the form of a bank certification of deposit or credit and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and a letter of intent (LOI) are signed. The process usually works as follows: Attorney for the buyer prepares LOI detailing terms including BTC purchase amount, commission, net discount and other details Proof of funds is provided within a specific timeframe of signing the LOI. A screenshot is not accepted: cryptographically provided proof of coin, sent via the blockchain, is required Master Fee Protection Agreement as well as Draft Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement may then be circulated and signed by all parties Money is placed in escrow, escrow verifies receipt of funds and BTC is sent to buyer’s wallet Transfer may be done in full or in tranches depending on the agreement\nGiven the desire of buyer and seller to preserve their privacy, and the need for each party to be connected in the first place, brokers play a vital role. But due to the lucrative prize at stake, it’s a job that attracts a lot of chancers – and a lot of Linkedin requests, much to the chagrin of other cryptocurrency users.

Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.\nDe Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $ 1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated:\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

Tether Supplies Rise to 2.77 Billion\nTether is right back at it, generating $250 million dollars worth of Tether with a few clicks, as of 11:20 AM PST today.\nAlthough this is just breaking news, the ‘granting’ of large amounts of Tether has been a topic of controversy for many in the community in the past.\nThe most recent granting of Tether might have caused the market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to recover by over 1% in the minutes following the Tether transactions on the blockchain.\nThe large green candles seen after 11:30, show the minutes right after the granting of $250 million dollars worth of Tether tokens. Bitcoin quickly ran up over $150 dollars in just under the 20 minutes after the ‘printing’ of the Tether, with most altcoins following. Ethereum also went up by over $20 dollars in the same time span.\nCoincidence? Many think not.\nSome suggest that Tether has been using their token as a way to manipulate the price of cryptocurrencies.\nMany have also brought to question the legitimacy of funds backing Tether tokens. Rightfully so, as Tether has been slow to produce the right documentation of their holdings. Earlier this year, the Tether foundation fired their auditor for reasons which are still unknown, a move which brought further suspicion to the organization.\nWith the addition of $250 Million worth of Tether, USDT supplies now number over 2.75 billion.\nIt is crazy to comprehend that there are over $2.75 billion real US dollars backing this token. But until Tether shows that they actually have that amount of money sitting in their bank accounts, community distrust in this specific stablecoin will continue. Is Tether Losing its Grip on The Stablecoin Industry?\nThe landscape may begin to change for Tether, as competition has been showing up in full force to combat the monopoly which Tether currently holds on stablecoins.\nRecent news has indicated that other companies in the space, like Circle, TrueUSD, and Basis , have begun to develop their own stablecoins.\nNewly founded projects like TrueUSD have already proven themselves to be good alternatives to Tether. However, TrueUSD’s listing on Binance was too much for the price of the coin’s liquidity to handle, as prices reached over $1.30 on Binance within minutes of the listing. Binance quickly had to reverse the listing of TrueUSD before announcing that they would delay the trading date to the 22nd of May.\nThe project still shows promise, through the regulatory compliance which TrueUSD has been known for. Unlike Tether, TrueUSD can actually be claimed for US dollars through a smart contract system, further adding to the validity of the token and the project.\nIn other news, Goldman Sachs backed Circle has announced a stablecoin startup that will attempt to also peg the value of a cryptocurrency to the U.S. dollar. Circle plans on creating a dollar that is transparent, efficient and virtual using the blockchain to facilitate transactions.\nCircle CEO Jeremy Allaire put it best when he said:\nIt unlocks an incredible amount of power for the dollar. It’s basically a dollar that operates on blockchain.\nUnlike Tether, Circle customers will have to hold the money required to produce the same amount of this new stablecoin. It is clear that Circle plans to improve on what Tether started by creating a very similar cryptocurrency but with a higher level of transparency and regulatory compliance.\nIt seems that Tether will be losing market dominance quick, as more and more stablecoin alternatives arrive for consumer consumption.\nWhat do you think about the legitimacy of Tether? Do you think that they actually have the funds to back up the tokens granted? We would love to know!

As noted in our last discussion, a break back into the TR would be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to maintain support within the TR would likely lead to a continuation of the downtrend:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Downtrend Continuation\nAfter establishing the Major Sign of Weakness (SOW), the market made a feeble rally and ultimately formed a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the point where supply begins to overwhelm the market and long positions begin to close as the demand dries up. Shortly after the rejection of the TR, the market established a new low. However, this low was pushed on fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping out a reversal pattern called a Falling Wedge (FW):\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Falling Wedge\nIf the price manages to break out of this FW it will have a modest $1,000 move upward. The measured move would have us retesting the lower $9,000s once again. However, if we fail to gain enough momentum upward, we would likely test the macro 61% Fibonacci retracement values:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Macro Fib Retracements\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Macro 61% Closer View\nIf we manage to test the 61%, this will again be a zone of evaluation as we wait to see how the market reacts to such strong, macro support. Summary: After a short-lived rally, bitcoin established a LPSY in the $8,800s before continuing to make new lows. Currently, the market is pushing new lows but on diminishing volume. The current price action is forming a Falling Wedge which, if it breaks upwards, would have a price target in the low $9,000s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.
