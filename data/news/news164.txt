Thomas Trutschel Photothek via Getty Images By Lucinda Shen May 23, 2018\nA German stock exchange that lists companies with over $2 trillion in combined market value is thinking about offering cryptocurrency-related products, joining the New York Stock Exchange in apparently mulling over an expansion into the trading of digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n“We are deep at work with it,” Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products, and core markets at Deutsche Boerse, said at an event hosted by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe on Wednesday, Bloomberg reports.\nThe Deutsche Boerse is one of the 10 world’s largest stock exchanges based on the value of the companies listed on it. The NYSE and Nasdaq, the latter of which is apparently open to the idea of one day opening a cryptocurrency exchange, meanwhile are the first and second largest respectively.\nLike other executives who have, or are considering offering crypto-related products for their companies, Tessler says Deutsche Boerse is trying to understand the space first, and see where it stands in the eyes of European regulators.\nThose comments come after reports in December that the German exchange was considering offering Bitcoin futures contracts, but also weighing the potential problems with offering them . That includes higher volatility, and a lack of regulation.\nThe price of Bitcoin meanwhile, is far off its near-$20,000 high in December. That run up was partly fueled by news that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Options Exchange were planning to offer Bitcoin futures.\nNow, the price of Bitcoin is around $7,500.

Lee identifies three key factors that make him believe the price will surge past the 2017 high. On Wednesday, BTC dropped below $8,000 and traded around $7,500, losing most of the gains it made from mid-April to early May. With Wednesday’s plunge, BTC is now down 41 percent this year. Lee believes the drop is only due to “typical crypto volatility”, and explains his bullish stance with three major factors. The first key factor is the BTC production and replication costs. At the “Futures Now” show on CNBC on Tuesday, Lee said that BTC was “trading at cost”, because the price of production was almost equal to the trading price. Since, according to Lee, the cost production for BTC production was around $6,000 on Wednesday, it is still worth more than its mining cost. Among the major factors which could trigger a possible price increase, Lee names institutional investors who, while interested in the crypto space, haven’t fully entered the industry due to regulatory uncertainties. He said: “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies.” Lastly, data compiled by Fundstrat shows a historical trend, by which Lee recommends that investors hold on to their BTC. He said: “Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin’s price. If you just took out those 10 days, Bitcoin’s down 25 percent a year. So as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.”\nEarlier this month, Fundstrat Global Advisors revealed research placing the BTC price at $36,000 in 2019 based on historical averages.

The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now trading near $997 per token, even after its recent fork which increased its block size fourfold.\n“TheÂ BitcoinÂ CashÂ network has been displaying some erratic behaviour over the past few weeks, which has contributed to the downwards pressure on prices,” Iqbal Gandham, managing director for eToro, a British crypto firm, told Business Insider in an email. “Despite a recent surge, itâs now moving towards the head and shoulders pattern weâve seen since last year.”\nLast week, bitcoin cash upgraded its software with a patch known as Bitcoin ABC, which increased the size of transaction blocks on the network from 8mb to 32mb. The upgrade also removed theÂ Segwit protocol, short for segregated witness, a process by which the number of transactions in a block can be increased by moving certain signature data from transactions to the end of the block.Â Bitcoin cashÂ has beenÂ accused of misleading investorsÂ by piggy-backing off the bitcoin name.\nWhile the new cryptocurrency includes the history of the original bitcoin’s transactions up until the split, since the fork, the two currencies are unrelated except for their shared history and name. Vocal bitcoin cash supporter Roger Ver, who ownsÂ bitcoin.comÂ via an LLC registered at a Marriott resort on St.\nKitts, and refers to the original bitcoin as “bitcoin core,” has appeared on numerous internet talk shows, including the conspiracy-theory site InfoWars, to promote the coin. “For over a year Bitcoin cash has been fighting the battle to become the ‘default’ bitcoin, a battle which traditionalists are not keen to lose,” Gandham said.

Perhaps you’ve heard quite a bit about it lately, and it has peaked your interest enough to inspire you to broaden your knowledge on the topic. Maybe your friend told you that you can actually buy things now using digital money instead of traditional one, and you wanted to try it out. Well, whatever the reason you’re here, we’ll make sure you have the basics of bitcoin in the tips of your fingers by the end of the post.\nA Brief History of the Bitcoin Network\nOur story begins in 2008, when a person (or people) under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper in which he spoke about a new digital cash system which would function without intermediaries, i.e. which would be decentralized . Although Nakamoto said that the design and coding began in 2007, the project wasn’t released until 2009, as open source software.\nThe entire network functions on a peer-to-peer technology and all transactions take place directly between users, with no banks or other institutions involved. What makes bitcoin different is that all members in the network need to verify your transaction first before it gets approved. That way, the system avoids fraud, the problem of double-spending, and other issues that the traditional cash system is susceptible to.\nToday, bitcoin is the largest and most well-known digital currency, and you can purchase goods or services on a variety of popular stores/websites, including Shopify stores, Microsoft, and CheapAir.\nChoosing a Digital Currency Exchange Platform\nIn order to obtain your own bitcoin and start shopping, you’ll need to register on one of the many digital currency exchanges —once you verify your account and connect your bank account to it, you can go ahead and “buy” your first digital cash. A lot of platforms also offer crypto wallets which you can use to safely store your bitcoin until your next purchase. In case a platform doesn’t offer a wallet of its own, you can go for a standalone one such as Trezor or Ledger.\nSo, there you have it: the basics of bitcoin.

Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

It leaves an impression wherever it goes. With the revolution of cryptocurrency taking over the world and minds of the people, Rober Shiller has also been affected and leaves an indelible impression on his blog post recently on Monday.\nAs Rober Shiller calls Bitcoin [BTC] and its fellow cryptocurrencies a ‘New Haven’. He believes that this revolution in technology is a sham.\nIn one of his recent interview, he talks about how this behaviour towards cryptocurrency is more psychological than any reason out there. He traces back in time and compares the soaring economic revolution to the failed experiences and concludes that this will end up in the dumps as well.\nHe mentions big names like Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Robert Owen and his attempt to establish the National Equitable Labour Exchange in London. Owen’s failed experiment of ‘Time money’ instead of gold and silver as a standard of value, Josiah Warner’s Cincinnati Time Store in 1827, a store that sold merchandise in units of hours of work and again relying on ‘Labour notes’ aka paper money. The stored closed in 1830 which leads to another failed experiment.\nThe Economist says:\n“It’s another faddish example of human behaviour, it’s glamorous. I don’t mean to dismiss it. Some smart people went into these, and other cryptocurrencies. But it’s a story that goes way beyond the merit of that idea. I don’t know for sure, but it strikes me that the reason why people are so excited about it, is more psychological than something that could be explained by the computer science department. A lot of people are kind of angry about politics if you noticed. So there is a big element of people who don’t trust the government anymore. And they like the idea that this didn’t come from the government it came from some real smart computer scientist. They really like that. Its a great story for today’s markets.”\nRobert Shiller is a Nobel-prize winning economist and a current professor at Yale. He was in the news for the warning about dot-com bubbles and housing. He is the author of Irrational Exuberance, a book on devolution and its speculation into mania.\nShiller says:\n“None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.”\nWhilst, Shiller mentions previous failed monetary experiences during the time and human life, Bitcoin [BTC], the largest cryptocurrency has been on the market for over a decade now. Despite its fluctuated rise and fall in the market, it’s market capitalization has bloomed to $143 billion according to CoinMarketCap.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rober shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josiah warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friedrich engels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "owen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert owen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karl marx", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national equitable labour exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati time store", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T00:50:31.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1a8c4152a5442a550b9c53bae5b9c389368b584", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3wveeLiwQeGE6R84JIptFNJBUevPN_YQi9pESzktQ_5GkjzF2s6Lqd9Mo1aU2TGg3X3D_YLJkAZi3S3J9hobHDQ-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "reddit: the front page of the internet", "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Payment by Cipherbook App : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin Lightning Payment by Cipherbook App : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1a8c4152a5442a550b9c53bae5b9c389368b584", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3wveeLiwQeGE6R84JIptFNJBUevPN_YQi9pESzktQ_5GkjzF2s6Lqd9Mo1aU2TGg3X3D_YLJkAZi3S3J9hobHDQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cipherdo", "published": "2018-05-24T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Payment by Cipherbook App : Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/cipherdo\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TgV9erLFFA"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T23:59:30.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "192c1c97d977093a1f5a0d58c95db51b862f0182", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQcSI_kUfLcS4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD -

The institution has partnered with the Latin America–focused exchange startup Bitex — founded in 2014 — to potentially compete with SWIFT , a global, bank-owned messaging network.\nSWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is built to handle and process international bank payments. Unfortunately, the project has been suffering from security issues since it first entered the monetary arena.\nBanco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to base its cross-border payment system on the Bitcoin network. The website states that the service is set to enable international transfers to as many as 50 countries and that payments can be processed in 24 hours or less. Translated from their website, the service “allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers, as there are no international banks [serving] as intermediaries.” The move was reportedly inspired by the bank’s goal to enhance its digital services and lower transaction costs.\nOne of the establishment’s principal shareholders, José Dakak, stated that the bank is also looking to grow its list of international customers. “One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad,” he explained.\nDakak then added, “The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider. For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin.”\nAside from accelerating transaction times, Bitex — according to its website — will provide heightened security for customers by enforcing “strictest compliance rules,” including know-your-client (KYC) measures. The company has also contracted one of the “Big Four” accounting and audit firms, Deloitte, to review and report on specific procedures, operations and balance funds.\nArgentina’s blockchain and cryptocurrency ambitions have witnessed regular growth over the past several months, and the Argentinian government has been relatively welcoming to the technology.

What are the differences?", "text": "There’s is much debate amongst the community regarding Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Which blockchain is better? Which one is superior? Seems to be the question at hand. A close look into community arguments rises what looks to be an ideological battle with memes and insults used as primary weapons. Comment threads often devolve into chaos with no useful information being presented at all and it leaves newcomers ignorant to the situation.\nSo what are the actually differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash? Let’s take a definitive look at both blockchains to shed some light on this argument.\nThe Scaling Debate The scaling debate is an issue at the heart of the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash controversy. The question of how to properly scale the network to handle ever increase demand is a challenging one, and the community is working hard to solve these issues. To give you some perspective, Visa claims their systems are capable of processing 65,000 transactions messages per second at capacity. Bitcoin on the other hand, currently, can handle a maximum of 10 transactions per-second , and Bitcoin Cash, 213tx/s . Transactions per-second is primarily determined by the blockchains block size. Because Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size of 32MB (compared to Bitcoins 1 - 4MB size), BCH is able to processes more transactions and at a lower fee, than BTC.\nSo does this mean Bitcoin Cash is superior to Bitcoin? Not necessarily, the Bitcoin network has another trick up its sleeve called the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer solution to the scaling issues Bitcoin is facing. In a nutshell, the way it works is a payment channel is opened between sender and receiver. Think of it as a tab between sender and receiver. Through this tab, payments would be extremely fast, secure, and lower fees. Only when the payment channel closes will the balance of the tabs be recorded on the blockchain, and users subjugated to BTC's fees. This is the goal of the Lightning Network, and I say goal because it is not yet completed and still in beta .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Maximum_transaction_rate", "https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2018/03/15/lnd-beta.html", "https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/aboutvisafactsheet.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:51:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66517b18060aec48bdb0ff1be7d59d317cb2db7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFT7FxcG7LpxXhyVLO3TOiW.yi6UXmd_Mx1Ph52PrawGKpi6g8ii_UxjDMtSurAtwyMJRwqvJvxmTLGtgKlUg5Ek", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "MIT Tests Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "title_full": "MIT Tests Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "published": "2018-05-24T00:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66517b18060aec48bdb0ff1be7d59d317cb2db7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFT7FxcG7LpxXhyVLO3TOiW.yi6UXmd_Mx1Ph52PrawGKpi6g8ii_UxjDMtSurAtwyMJRwqvJvxmTLGtgKlUg5Ek", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-24T00:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "MIT Tests Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

Now spend that amount of money on Ethereum. This is known as hashing the code to get some of that Bitcoin.”\nThe video also touches on the topic of blockchain, which a user can gain access to by installing “exploit.bin, and it will remind you every day of your biggest nightmares.”\nHaving Bitcoin - whose most popular form is the “Wild Richard” which can be used to pay for “counterfeit coffee” - is described as having advantages despite its risks:\n“One benefit of Bitcoin is that you can upload a version of your future self on the darknet, but it will kill your retirement account, because it is over 1,000 years old.”\nThe video ends with two warnings to all viewers, the first being that the “safest way to protect your Bitcoin wallet is simply to lose it,” and the second touching on a more personal subject:\n“Caution: the last time I mined a fresh Bitcoin, billionaire killer Mark February tried to patent my life.”\nCointelegraph has its own series of explainers that were not created with AI, including ones on Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, blockchain, and crypto wallets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "botnik studios", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:00:01.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d9dd38b3aeeab6a2df46ea4382d360abe03ea49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqarMrSifG4xey2.h5VwK3ki9c3fZUFgOGZe_IdUsdOnGi7Zp83hCC1yXp5iGcNzwQWCJblJqT31ZB6ZdZtb6JMhw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "Dutch company pays employees in bitcoin", "title_full": "Dutch company pays employees in bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T00:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d9dd38b3aeeab6a2df46ea4382d360abe03ea49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqarMrSifG4xey2.h5VwK3ki9c3fZUFgOGZe_IdUsdOnGi7Zp83hCC1yXp5iGcNzwQWCJblJqT31ZB6ZdZtb6JMhw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Exbu", "published": "2018-05-24T00:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dutch company pays employees in bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/Exbu\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ad.nl/economie/primeur-nederlands-bedrijf-betaalt-medewerkers-in-bitcoin~ab117702/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:49:55.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee981e657a20549e943b6e92eedd5b291a19f0fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VGISmYZvA8eFMBKLKRGGEf7gLRbTuCj8oqLcQDGPEF3foLeUWuBmWUj1uZsmnrcGZ3t_5EHfDyKEHsIY427KXR8Rbscyg9IA5TswvymK8Ul4P7HLZ2gPf4t0pt0oHpTXi82YNKQHdSm6mal5iNP05TJjAyasAhlpJQo6DtPA2_g--", "site_full": "www.zombiecommand.com", "site": "zombiecommand.com", "site_section": "http://www.zombiecommand.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Zombie Command", "title": "gute Professional Levitra 20 mg aus der apotheke – We Accept BitCoin – No Script Online Pharmacy", "title_full": "gute Professional Levitra 20 mg aus der apotheke – We Accept BitCoin – No Script Online Pharmacy", "published": "2018-05-24T00:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee981e657a20549e943b6e92eedd5b291a19f0fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VGISmYZvA8eFMBKLKRGGEf7gLRbTuCj8oqLcQDGPEF3foLeUWuBmWUj1uZsmnrcGZ3t_5EHfDyKEHsIY427KXR8Rbscyg9IA5TswvymK8Ul4P7HLZ2gPf4t0pt0oHpTXi82YNKQHdSm6mal5iNP05TJjAyasAhlpJQo6DtPA2_g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LendMeYourEyes", "published": "2018-05-24T00:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "gute Professional Levitra 20 mg aus der apotheke – We Accept BitCoin – No Script Online Pharmacy", "text": "gute Professional Levitra 20 mg aus der apotheke Generic Professional Levitra\nbestes Professional Levitra rezeptfrei.

000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nGerman stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse is “deep at work” on evaluating whether to offer bitcoin futures and other cryptocurrency-related products, one of the firm’s top executives said on Wednesday.\nSpeaking at an industry even in London sponsored by the Association for Financial Markets, Deutsche Boerse head of clients Jeffrey Tessler said that the firm is holding serious discussions about listing bitcoin products, though it still has reservations about the nascent asset class.\n“Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do,” Bloomberg quotes him as saying, “we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.”\n“We are deep at work with it,” he added.\nTessler said that the company is “not at the same stage” in its comfort level with bitcoin as CME, its Chicago-based rival and the world leader in regulated bitcoin futures trading. CME has also said that it is gauging client interest in an ethereum futures product, and its recent launch of an ether price index has laid the groundwork for that development.\nBut while CME and fellow Chicago exchange CBOE have seen as much as $670 million in combined bitcoin futures volume during a single trading session, no major European exchange has listed derivatives products for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.\nAs CCN reported, regulated UK trading platform Crypto Facilities has launched futures products for bitcoin, ether, and XRP. Pricing data from the exchange’s bitcoin and ether products is included in CME’s bitcoin and ether reference rate indices. However, these products have yet to catch on at larger venues like Deutsche Boerse.\nIn the US, meanwhile, the operators of both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are holding discussions about listing cryptocurrency products, and the NYSE is rumored to be considering whether to launch a full-fledged cryptocurrency exchange.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stock exchange deutsche boerse advertisement join", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association for financial markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:00:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9090c0a4e7a2eb173254604a29013d998edf25d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQPC5g1AI2_JpoA3hVCyRI.M1rxcOScJQ1FPzn90v2uGEEyT9nIhSJBZCnQrkp2nBQ-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Fmr.

Obama Aide Attacked for Taking Bitcoin Contributions for Political Campaign", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nTwo California Democrats running for Congress are at odds over one’s decision to accept bitcoin contributions. In his campaign ad, ex-SEC attorney Dave Min slammed former Barack Obama aide Brian Forde for accepting BTC political donations.\n“Brian Forde’s big donors? Bitcoin speculators who oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking,” Min’s ad trumpeted.\nThe video suggested that cryptocurrencies are only good for illegal activities, and that crypto investors are all potential criminals.\nIn the ad viewed by Motherboard, Forde’s smiling face is superimposed against a grainy background image of a menacing-looking hacker in a hoodie.\nDave Min’s campaign ad featuring Brian Forde. (Image credit: Motherboard) The state of California has recommended that politicians not accept virtual currencies as campaign contributions, but does not prohibit the practice.\nForde is a cryptocurrency bull who was previously senior advisor to the Obama administration on digital technologies. He’s outraged by Min’s campaign attack ad, which he slammed as “reckless.”\n‘Reckless and Sensationalist’ “These comments about my supporters are sensationalist, wildly inaccurate, and in line with my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology,” Forde told Motherboard. “If they were speculating, they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in bitcoin. They didn’t ‘HODL.’ They donated to my campaign in bitcoin because they believe in the technology.”\nForde said part of the reason why he’s running for Congress is to shine a spotlight on the potential of new technologies such as crypto, which he believes is misunderstood by the public.\nMin is a law professor at the University of California at Irvine who was previously an enforcement attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHis rep told Axios that Min “is a huge believer in the potential of distributed ledger technology,” but has “deep concerns about the deregulatory agenda being pushed by bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.”\nSenator Rand Paul Accepted BTC This is not the first time that cryptocurrency donations have been a bone of contention in politics.\nIn April 2018, ethics officials in the state of Wisconsin debated whether to allow political campaigns to accept crypto-contributions, as CCN has reported.\nNo final decision was reached, but if Wisconsin approves the move, it will join Montana, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. federal government in allowing cryptocurrency campaign donations.\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky famously accepted BTC contributions when he ran for president in 2016. He eventually lost to Donald Trump, but made history for becoming the first U.S. presidential candidate to accept bitcoin to fund his campaign.\nPaul is a Republican by party affiliation, but a libertarian by personal philosophy, so it’s no surprise that he embraces crypto.\nSenator Rand Paul. (YouTube) Meanwhile, if California congressional candidate Dave Min is concerned about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency industry, he may be heartened by recent developments.\nSince April 2018, U.S. and Canadian regulators have launched 70 investigations into crypto scams and fraudulent ICOs as part of a coordinated crackdown across North America called “Operation Crypto Sweep.”\nSEC Chair Praises ‘Operation Crypto Sweep’ The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) sent cease-and-desist letters to sham ICO operators in more than 40 jurisdictions across the United States and Canada. And that’s just in the past month.\nOperation Crypto Sweep is just getting started. The wide-ranging fraud crackdown won praise from SEC chairman Jay Clayton, as CCN has reported.\n“I applaud our fellow regulators in the United States and Canada who are coordinating and participating in efforts to police fraud,” Clayton said. “The enforcement actions…should be a strong warning to would-be fraudsters in this space that many sets of eyes are watching.”\nMany crypto evangelists welcome some regulation because ridding the space of con artists benefits the entire industry.

The Head of an Investment Firm Compares Bitcoin And Tulips By May 23, 2018 The chief economist of the world’s largest investment company flopped the cryptocurrency\nJoe Davis, chief economist and development director of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, highly appreciated the prospects of blocking technology. At the same time, he compared the growth in the popularity of cryptocurrencies with tulipmania, which originated in the Netherlands in the 17th century and has since been considered a classic example of an exchange bubble.\nDavis, whose firm manages $5.1 trillion, said:\nWhat can you say about bitcoin as a currency? There is a considerable probability that its price will be zero.\nDavis further made a banal comparison between the crypto-currency and the general fascination of the inhabitants of Holland with tulips in the 17th century.\nCrypto-currencies, unlike tulips, cannot be put in a vase to admire them.\nAccording to Davis, one can argue whether the Cryptocurrency is really a currency. Digital currencies can be considered a unit of account and a means of exchange, but not a means of saving.\nEven if the Cryptocurrencies take their place in the market, their prospects seem questionable.\nCryptocurrencies do not generate income or dividends, their price is formed on the basis of speculation, their value is not related to the value of blocking technology, and for investors traditional markets are more interesting. He gave an example:\nBitcoin is just as similar to the investment in blockbuster as the site Pets.com is similar to the investment in Internet technology.\nWhen Bitcoin’s rate fell last year, the Nasdaq exchange also compared BTC to tulipomania.\nThe fascination with tulipanomania is exaggerated. The researcher Ann Goldgher wrote in her book that “not many people took part in the tulip speculation, and the economic consequences were rather insignificant.”\nWarren Buffett also spoke sharply towards Bitcoin earlier this month, calling him “rat poison.” In response, the Cointelegraph published an article stating that Wall Street would fall behind if it did not start investing in promising technologies like blockbuster.

The online travel agency is now accepting bitcoin cash (BCH), dash (DASH), and litecoin (LTC) payments for its offerings.\nCheapAir Expands Cryptocurrency Support The three additions will strengthen the travel agency's cryptocurrency community support hold that has been growing over the years.\nIn 2013, CheapAir became the first travel agency to accept bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option for booking hotel rooms and Amtrak train seats. The company, later on, added support for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC), on bitcoin sales surging to $1.5 million .\nCheapAir 's support for cryptocurrencies payments has seen it cement its reputation when it comes to adoption of the new payment option. The addition of new cryptocurrencies was triggered by growing customer demand for such payment options. The travel agency also added the new digital currencies to address the shortcomings of current currencies and the challenges that have come to be, with the usage of bitcoin.\nAdding support for other cryptocurrencies will seek to address the shortcomings of bitcoin . Network congestion and higher transaction fees have seen most people shun the popular cryptocurrency, with the focus now shifting to the likes of bitcoin cash and litecoin.\n\"Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we've seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we've worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested,\" said CheapAir CEO Jeff Klee.\nSource: Twitter\nCryptocurrencies Payments Proliferation Cryptocurrencies bookings are also backed by the agency's Price Drop Payback , a price guarantee that gives customers up to $100 in travel credit in case a flight fare drops.\nAccepting cryptocurrencies payments on behalf of hotel suppliers and airlines has had its fair share of challenges given the constant price fluctuations. However, CheapAir insists it has solved a good number of the problems and should continue offering support for the foreseeable future.\nWhile CheapAir was the first to accept cryptocurrencies payments for hotel and flight bookings, it is no longer the only one offering such services. Integration of such payments into the mainstream sector has gained momentum in the recent past. ABitSky, BTCTrip, and Destinia are examples of other travel sites that allow people to purchase flights using bitcoin .\nSince Madrid-based Destinia started accepting bitcoin payments, the agency claims to have registered a spike in such payments in contrast to credit card payments.\nCryptocurrency Merchant Adoption There needs to be real merchant adoption if cryptocurrencies are to compete with fiat currencies in future . Very few merchants accept such payments and those that do, do not account for a considerable chunk of market share in their respective fields of operation.\nCryptocurrency merchant adoption is still lagging even with bitcoin's meteoric rise to become one of the most sought-after investment. Accelerated adoption has been stiffed by the fact that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile, something that affects their value, unlike fiat currencies that are relatively stable.\nMerchants have shied away from adopting such payment on concerns that they could affect their returns, given their constant value fluctuation. Regulatory concerns have also had a catastrophic impact on the adoption of cryptocurrencies as there are areas and countries where dealing in cryptocurrencies is banned. For instance, banks and other financial institutions in India are prohibited from providing support for cryptocurrencies payments.\nThe post CheapAir Adds Support For Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin for Flights and Hotel Bookings appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheapair", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheapair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amtrak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T00:09:52.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7240f61c545aeee01f3fc6bdbc0b9f75c59a741d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSYzbhbhKcuHvoKD7O82YnzaURxGILKMjiaWzLuB472tP9nlsq7rinMBe0CTkZFs60g--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "UK Mosque Opens Crypto Donations in National First 'Bitcoin Ramadan'", "title_full": "UK Mosque Opens Crypto Donations in National First 'Bitcoin Ramadan'", "published": "2018-05-24T00:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7240f61c545aeee01f3fc6bdbc0b9f75c59a741d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSYzbhbhKcuHvoKD7O82YnzaURxGILKMjiaWzLuB472tP9nlsq7rinMBe0CTkZFs60g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T00:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "UK Mosque Opens Crypto Donations in National First 'Bitcoin Ramadan'", "text": "UK Mosque Opens Crypto Donations in National First 'Bitcoin Ramadan'\nUK Mosque Opens Crypto Donations in National First 'Bitcoin Ramadan' Cointelegraph Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T00:08:34.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08c09573c51e7c491b128a669e2e7672ded69acd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7yRMtm77WYg2FPXSAssSAhYje5hhP121RKgL_gspN5CY_.rFIAXQoLeWmVSClaHmWKBEjXarrwHQVqccQuGWhWXikVZNUgkXfsVuSglmx_vtZJZdYwSghn27b2XmgWxKCw--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Would requesting a refund for a Bitcoin order be a better way to transform your Bitcoin in national currency?", "title_full": "Would requesting a refund for a Bitcoin order be a better way to transform your Bitcoin in national currency?", "published": "2018-05-24T00:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08c09573c51e7c491b128a669e2e7672ded69acd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7yRMtm77WYg2FPXSAssSAhYje5hhP121RKgL_gspN5CY_.rFIAXQoLeWmVSClaHmWKBEjXarrwHQVqccQuGWhWXikVZNUgkXfsVuSglmx_vtZJZdYwSghn27b2XmgWxKCw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ionică Bizău", "published": "2018-05-24T00:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Would requesting a refund for a Bitcoin order be a better way to transform your Bitcoin in national currency?", "text": "Let example.com be a shop on the internet accepting Bitcoin as payment system, along with USD payments.\nIn the context of a refund, the user gets back USD.\nNow, Alice has, let's say some bitcoins, and she wants to convert them into USD.

Paradex: The P2P ERC20 DEX Paradex isn’t your usual cryptocurrency exchange platform. It is a peer-to-peer (P2P) ERC20 DEX service that utilizes the 0x protocol. As a DEX, it offers users the ability to trade cryptos directly from their wallets rather than using centralized services like Coinbase, Gemini, etc. Thus, users have full custodial rights over their tokens and fiat capital.\nAccording to the platform’s website, Paradex is excited at the prospect of becoming part of the Coinbase crypto ecosystem. A statement on the site reads: It was clear from our first conversations with Coinbase that the excitement and optimism was mutual. Like Coinbase, we believe wholeheartedly in the power of an open financial system; it’s paramount to what we’re working towards at Paradex. In our next steps together, we’ll continue to build out the existing Paradex roadmap and continue to explore the world of decentralization and the amazing opportunities at hand.

Many cryptocurrency are making negative comments about Bitcoin price. They think Bitcoin condition will not be able to return to its previous state. But I do not think so. What do you think?\nHi there mdyeatul! Bitcoin price frustrate most of the people since it fall below the 15k mark. However, some could tolerate the price, but beyond that there are more people become frustrated especially those who invest in the 4th quarter last year. But for others who have invested long way enough, the bitcoin price today is still considered profitable. But I think that due to government never ending closure, clean up and intervention to regulate and make the bitcoin more secure becomes a double sided blade which hurt the bitcoin itself.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:23:41.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "023eb2a18f37c30fbd34241816966cee28458c9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPooDc21lOrP6ZEc62SZHZ0KF6cSwBlsav19Jrb3yjg_FJ4IYrnmdVVra89ut2KX0N.h7kFnuWYqqeJbYPx7NHtQ-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Putting aside who is right or wrong, I find it a bit funny that r/bitcoin which has 4 times the number of subscribers cant have more discussion.

On Wednesday, the cryptocurrency plunged below $8,000 and traded at around $7,500, essentially giving up most of the gains bitcoin had managed to make from mid-April to early May after hitting 2018 lows.\nBut not only does Lee believe Wednesday’s drop is solely due to “typical crypto volatility,” as he said in an email to CNBC, he also identifies three key factors that still have him believing bitcoin will hit $25,000. The first is the cost of producing and replicating bitcoin.\nWhen bitcoin was trading at around $8,000 on Tuesday, Lee appeared on CNBC’s “Futures Now” saying the digital currency was actually “trading at cost” because the price of production was actually about that amount. Despite the plunge, Lee also wrote to CNBC that the cost of production for bitcoin on Wednesday was at around $6,000, meaning that in Lee’s eyes, bitcoin is still actually worth more than its cost of production.\nBut among the big catalysts that will boost the crypto space, Lee is keeping an eye on institutional investors. “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,” he said on CNBC’s “Futures Now.”\n“But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.” And finally, data compiled by Fundstrat show a historical trend that has Lee encouraging investors to hold onto bitcoin.

Bitcoin cash fell more than 12% to below $1,000 on Wednesday. The cryptocurrency recently increased its block size fourfold to support more transactions. Follow bitcoin cash in real-time here.\nBitcoin cash sank more than 12% Wednesday, falling below $1,000 for the first time since April.\nThe fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now trading near $997 per token, even after its recent fork which increased its block size fourfold. Markets Insider\n“The Bitcoin Cash network has been displaying some erratic behaviour over the past few weeks, which has contributed to the downwards pressure on prices,” Iqbal Gandham, managing director for eToro, a British crypto firm, told Business Insider in an email. “Despite a recent surge, it’s now moving towards the head and shoulders pattern we’ve seen since last year.”\nLast week, bitcoin cash upgraded its software with a patch known as Bitcoin ABC, which increased the size of transaction blocks on the network from 8mb to 32mb. The upgrade also removed the Segwit protocol , short for segregated witness, a process by which the number of transactions in a block can be increased by moving certain signature data from transactions to the end of the block.\nBitcoin cash has been accused of misleading investors by piggy-backing off the bitcoin name. While the new cryptocurrency includes the history of the original bitcoin’s transactions up until the split, since the fork, the two currencies are unrelated except for their shared history and name.\nVocal bitcoin cash supporter Roger Ver, who owns bitcoin.com via an LLC registered at a Marriott resort on St. Kitts, and refers to the original bitcoin as “bitcoin core,” has appeared on numerous internet talk shows, including the conspiracy-theory site InfoWars, to promote the coin.\n“For over a year Bitcoin cash has been fighting the battle to become the ‘default’ bitcoin, a battle which traditionalists are not keen to lose,” Gandham said. “This lack of clarity, has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of Bitcoin cash, and until that is resolved the direction of price movement will always carry an air of uncertainty.

All major coins lost ground, with some of the top 10 coins losing as much as 15%. A major sell-off has been given as the main reason for the drop, although US and Canadian regulators have launched major investigations into at least 70 cryptocurrency investment schemes.\nBitcoin prices are more volatile than experienced investors are used to, but prices slid to a low of $7,507.88, shedding 8% from the start of the day and nearly 10% over the course of the past week. Prices had recovered slightly, reaching $7,595 at 21:00 GMT.\nEthereum (ETH), which is Bitcoin’s closest rival, had fallen 11% to $593.96 while Ripple (XRP) fell 8.3% down to $0.611. Other top 20 coins with notable movement include EOS, which has its mainnet release at the start of June, shed 13.85% down to $11.08.\nIn the top 50 coins, 0x and Bitcoin Private (BTCP) were the only two tokens to see gains, increasing 19.25% and 1.68% to $1.48 and $19.46 respectively.\nSome investors had expected a bull run following last week’s week-long Consensus blockchain conference , but prices have fallen since then.\nThe US and Canadian governments have launched a large scale investigation into potentially fraudulent Bitcoin investment schemes in recent days. The investigation will look at more than 70 schemes, but most people see this as a positive movement in the unregulated crypto market. The Securities and Exchange Commission have recently taken action against companies for using fraudulent details, misleading advertising campaigns, and for illegally and unlawfully using images of celebrities, claiming that they had invested in schemes that they hadn’t.\n Bitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T23:08:41.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "204c1eb534eae97bc8f293da48285be5b9f9657e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfUSwKKWtJ6wYs0_5lZcZQ0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "title_full": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "published": "2018-05-23T23:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.626, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "204c1eb534eae97bc8f293da48285be5b9f9657e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfUSwKKWtJ6wYs0_5lZcZQ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kjnfmplm", "published": "2018-05-23T23:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "text": "Bitcoin being a volatile currency, having a big loss, and the risk of being scammed or phished online are the main risks of investing in any cryptocurrency, in my opinion.

It seems only fitting to have the 2018 National Settlement Services Summit (NS3) close with a lively discussion of this topic.\nDuring the session titled “Blockchain, Bitcoin and You,” three industry insiders will discuss how the growth of Blockchain and cryptocurrency stands to benefit title agents, lenders, Realtors and borrowers.\n“I don’t want to sound too simplistic but it’s just going to change the way we do everything,” Crypto Realty Group CEO Piper Moretti said. “Rather than going to several different sources for all the information that we need as Realtors, we’ll be able to close on a house in a matter of a few days rather than a month to 45 or 60 days. Transactions will be infinitely faster. That’s the end goal, I believe.”\nMoretti will be joined by John Heck, director industry general manager at DXC Technology Co. and former of IBM, and Matt Einheber, principal at Transfer: Real Estate Intelligence.\nIn addition to speed, the speakers will detail how Blockchain could improve fraud mitigation, reduce errors, cut down on paperwork and much more.\nMoretti said she is working with some startups in the process of developing essentially a one-stop shop for all parts of the real estate transaction, from beginning to end. The efficiency of Blockchain enables them to dream big in terms of ushering in a new modern era of real estate transactions.\n“We’ll look at traditional recordkeeping, which is completely archaic, and what is hopefully coming down the pike,” she said. “It really just comes down to adoption. How fast can we do it and how fast can we learn it.”\nSome states already are taking steps to better accommodate Blockchain, she noted, such as Arizona and California. Both states have introduced legislation to make Blockchain a legal form of recordkeeping, which could alleviate issues with the use of cryptocurrency that continue to crop up.\nThe speakers also will touch on how companies can effectively protect borrowers’ sensitive information and keep them abreast of information that is pivotal to a smooth home-buying process.\nFor more information on the 2018 NS3, including the agenda and a list of speakers, click here .
