Streng said that Genesis will be revealing a giant billboard in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, “It says, ‘Warren we get your point, but we think you are not right.’”Last year, Genesis connected the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HVBTF: US), the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm. The company calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. In terms of the growth of the crypto-space, Streng said it is still very much in its infancy. “There is still room for the people trying this at home, we are still in the phase of the California gold rush [in crytpos],” Streng is a panelist at the Consensus 2018 conference, which will set participants back roughly $2,000 per ticket.

They announce the Presale Phase of the EMI Token will be launched on May 14, 2018\nCompetitive Video Gaming – known as Esports – is becoming increasingly popular year after year. In the latest report, market researcher Newzoo predicts esports global revenues will reach $905.6m in 2018, up 38.2% on last year, and $1.65bn in 2021. In its early years esports sponsorship was largely endemic brands associated with gaming or computer peripherals, but more recently large mainstream brands such as Mercedes, Gillette, Red Bull and many more are getting involved.\nThe esports audience is very valuable to mainstream advertisers. They are mostly in their 20s and 30s, passionate, very engaged, and with a higher than average disposable income. As audiences for traditional sports are declining, more fans are turning to esports. According to an LEK Consulting Survey, already 40% of millennials prefer esports to traditional sports. Mainstream brands are starting to follow.\nHowever, there are a number of issues facing the esports marketing world.\nComplexity of the Market – esports can be complicated for brands new to the market. There are several game titles, genres, leagues, teams and tournaments and it can be difficult to understand the best channels to reach the desired target audience.\nScale – Esports revolves mostly around major tournaments, unlike traditional sports where smaller local competitions and league games happen frequently. As the scale of these increases, it is difficult for brands and advertisers with more limited budgets to get involved. Likewise, it is becoming more difficult for smaller tournaments and teams, and streamers with smaller audiences to gain access to the large advertising budgets available to their more successful counterparts.\nAgencies and Intermediaries – These complicate the marketing landscape, fragmenting the industry and further reducing access to participants with lower budgets. Efficiency and return on investment is reduced by the number of “middlemen” involved in the industry.\nLack of Data – As a relatively new industry which is changing all the time mean it is difficult to get accurate and consistent data to measure the success of marketing campaigns.\nEIPlatform is being developed from the ground up to provide a solution to these issues by facilitating effective, direct interaction between brands, participants and the audience. One of the key aims of EIPlatform is to replace agencies with a single point of entry to the market for more personalized and efficient direct marketing. Security of transactions is a key element in the development of the platform, and one that is sadly missing from the current esports market.\nThe platform will simplify the current fragmented market and allow access for smaller teams to the large advertising budgets involved at the top level of the industry. At the same time, it will allow all sizes of new advertisers and brands to access the audience much more easily.\nEIPlatform’s advanced data management and analysis, made possible by blockchain and smart contracts, will allow brands and advertisers to understand and target their desired audience segment more effectively. They will be able to measure the performance of their investments and identify new opportunities within the esports marketplace.\nThe EIPlatform currently has no competition in esports. With the team’s technical ability and unique understanding of the problems faced by those in the esports industry, they are confident that the concepts underlying the project are solid. The team is headed by Sergey Nevodnichiy, the founder and CEO of international most successful esport team, Team Empire. He says, “The scope of the EIPlatform is ambitious, but there is no doubt that the EIP team have the right combination of abilities to succeed in this venture. EIPlatform has the potential to be a game-changer for the esports marketing industry.”\nIntroducing the EMI Token EIPlatform will be built on a blockchain system and all payments within the system will be via smart contracts using EMI. Smart contracts will provide the security and transparency for all transactions within the system that is crucial to such a project. EIPlatform is built on Ethereum architecture, chosen for its stability and security.\nEMI tokens are priced at 0.1USD and in total, 880,000,000 will be released. The esports industry is digital, making it the ideal place to use smart contracts and blockchain technology. All transactions between entities within the EIPlatform ecosphere will be made using EMI. Consequently, demand is expected to be high and continue to rise as the project approaches completion towards the end of 2018, and launches in Q1, 2019. The full roadmap is available on the EIPlatform website.\nEIPlatform is proud to announce the launch of the Pre-Sale Phase of the EMI token on May 14. This will run in 2 phases:\nPhase 1 is from May 14-23 and will feature 25% bonus to encourage early investors.\nPhase 2 of the presale phase will run from 24-30 May and will include 20% bonus.

The new service is expected to provide “reliable, real-time information” for six digital coins across major crypto exchanges. The stated goal is to encourage efficiency and transparency for cryptocurrency investors within the global market place.\nAlso read: Thomson Reuters and Marketpsych Launch Bitcoin Sentiment Index Six Cryptocurrencies Will Be Tracked\nThe new Cryptocurrency Real Time Rates are already accessible through a customized API interface on Thomson Reuters Eikon platform. The application is providing trading data from various crypto exchanges including Bitflyer and Bitpoint . More trading platforms will be added in the future, according to a Reuters report.\nThe announcement comes after a recent Thomson Reuters survey found that cryptocurrency trading by financial firms is likely increase this year. About 20% of 400 finance companies participating in the study are considering entering trading crypto assets within 12 months. That means that one in every five of the undisclosed businesses plans to establish direct contact with cryptocurrencies in 2018.\nPricing data for the real-time rates will cover six cryptocurrencies, not mentioned in the report. The launch of the service could be interpreted as an indication that Reuters is considering embracing the digital asset class on ‎its own trading platforms. In December, the mass media and information giant added bitcoin cash (BCH) to Eikon. BCH became only the third cryptocurrency to list on the platform after bitcoin core (BTC) and ethereum. ‎\nThe latest release comes after an announcement from CME Group which is launching a daily price benchmark for ‎Ethereum, as reported by Financial Magnets . The service will be provided in partnership with the cryptocurrency trading platform Crypto Facilities.‎\nEarlier this year, Thomson Reuters Corp. announced the launch of a new version of the Marketpsych Indices sentiment data feed, which includes analysis of bitcoin market sentiment. The service is provided in cooperation with Marketpsych Data LLC, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in March. 400 news and social media sites, including many specific to cryptocurrencies, have been added to the feed. Each one of them is scanned and scored in real time to ascertain market-moving sentiments and themes. Immense Growth Highlights Strong Momentum\nAccording to Michael Go, head of FX Market Development for Asia Pacific at Thomson Reuters, the immense growth in the cryptocurrency market in the last decade highlights the strong momentum around the new technology and the tradable asset class. “Thomson Reuters Cryptocurrency Real Time Rates enhances our rate offering and helps create a transparent and efficient global marketplace, vital to the future stability of cryptocurrency trading to support the investor,” he commented.\n“As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bitflyer has made efforts to facilitate the development of cryptocurrency markets,” said Yuzo Kano, CEO and co-founder of the trading platform. He noted that Bitflyer is the first company to obtain license to trade cryptocurrencies in Japan, the US and Europe. “We are delighted to be able to provide valuable data to customers worldwide through Thomson Reuters,” Kano added.\nPresident and representative director of Bitpoint, Genki Oda, also expressed satisfaction with the partnership on the real-time rates. “We are pleased to cooperate with Thomson Reuters in the further enhancement of its services and hope that our data will become a benchmark for the cryptocurrency industry as a global cryptocurrency trading exchange,” Oda said.\nDo you think the introduction of services like the real-time crypto rates helps the adoption of cryptocurrencies?

Resolving an Expensive Issue\nIn an official announcement dated May 14 th , Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County’s Tax Collector, disclosed that his office will be accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as means for payment of different services beginning this summer.\nFor a long time, users who chose to pay their taxes with a credit or debit card were charged with hefty fees. This was because they were using a third-party payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard. Now, as the agency will begin accepting cryptocurrencies, these days will be no more.\nThanks to Bitcoin technology, the Seminole County Tax Collector will reduce transactions fees and improve payment accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. Greenberg:\nWe live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government, […] The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options. Saving on Fees\nThe agency subtly states that by allowing its taxpayers to use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the heavy fees which are associated with using third-party payment processors will be eliminated. That’s great, but who’s the one who has to pay those fees in the first place?\n“Interchange is a small fee paid by a merchant’s bank (acquirer) to a cardholder’s bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments,” MasterCard’s official website reads.\nThus, Seminole County’s Tax Collector claims that the main premise of the new payments option is to reduce the costs paid by the government. The more money saved on fees, the more tax money for spending for social benefits. Though, the words used in the announcement may lead taxpayers to believe that they will be saving money. But Why Pay Taxes in Bitcoin?\nIt goes without saying that an official tax agency recognizing cryptocurrencies as an official payments method is significant. But how necessary is it really?\nThere are two types of taxpayers: those who own cryptocurrencies and those who don’t. In order for the latter to take advantage of the implanted change, one would have to jump through various hoops: research and learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet, register on an exchange and go through the KYC process to buy BTC or BCH, and only then can they send it to the Tax Collector’s receiving address.\nThis is quite bothersome and there doesn’t seem to be much incentive for the layman to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes compared to existing methods.\nThe former group however is more likely to take advantage of the new payment option since they already have cryptocurrency and are familiar with how it works. But let’s stop for a moment and think about this.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is its pseudonymous privacy. Therefore, some may see this as a Trojan Horse getting bitcoin holders to reveal their identities, and to the local taxman no less. What do you think?\nWould you pay your taxes with cryptocurrencies if you could?

A hard fork is usually a fundamental change of the blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology, underpinning a coin. Typically, a hard fork results in two separate coins created, like when Bitcoin Cash forked from core bitcoin in a contentious split over scalability in August , resulting in core and cash versions of the virtual currency. The cash version represented an upgrade to processing power to 8-megabyte units, rather than the one-megabyte block core bitcoin.\nThis hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, however, differs from a conventional hark fork in that no new coins will be created and the older version of BCH will carry no economic value and become obsolete—if all goes well. The upgraded BCH will mean blocksizes will be increased to 32MB, resulting in even faster transactions and lower network fees, according to market participants.\nWhat are altcoins and futures doing?

The ride has been wild and the opinions on the outlook in the market have been shifting. We hold a steady course and strive to filter out all the noise to give you the most relevant information. An there’s rarely a more important time than now for that. The tide might have turned and we’re on the lookout for a confirmation of the trigger. Such a confirmation could increase the profits on our hypothetical position. The South Korean government moved to raid the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the country. On Reuters, we read : South Korean prosecutors raided the country’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, on Thursday and Friday on suspicion of fraud, Yonhap news agency reported. The agency did not give details. Neither Upbit nor the financial investigation team of the Seoul Southern District public prosecutors’ office was immediately available for comment.. Upbit sent a note to its clients that it is co-operating with the prosecutors and that it can guarantee that all its clients’ assets are secure. Four executives from two other South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges were detained in April in connection with the alleged embezzlement of billions of won. It is important not to panic at this moment. The government is not out there to get your bitcoins. The action of South Korean prosecutors is most likely an extension of their usual activities. The only special thing about the whole situation is that it involves Bitcoin. For the government, it doesn’t really matter if potential fraud is committed with checks, credit cards or Bitcoin. Sorry if this doesn’t quite sound as exciting as a conspiracy theory involving malicious activities on the part of the South Korean authorities. But we would rather give you a story which is true than one which is exciting but false. The one thing to keep in mind as a Bitcoin trader is to always conduct your own due diligence before committing funds to any particular exchange. Review the legal standing of the exchange, check the opinions of its users and so forth. However, even if a specific exchange doesn’t do anything inherently illegal, it is still possible that the regulator doesn’t have a full grasp of the concept of cryptocurrencies and might overreact to Bitcoin exchanges. It might be wise to diversify between Bitcoin exchanges in order to not have all your funds locked into one specific platform. Bitcoin at Short-term Resistance On BitStamp, from the short-term perspective, the recent rally and the subsequent move down have given us the opportunity to apply Fibonacci retracements to the recent local top, which was not really possible earlier. This analysis shows that something important might be going on in the market. Bitcoin went down from the recent local top and right to the 38.2% retracement. This might be significant for the next couple of days. At the moment of writing these words, the currency is fluctuating around this level. If we see a confirmed move below this level, the move down might accelerate. It is possible that we could see a move up from here, but the move might be limited by the level of the recent local top around $10,000. On the other hand, the move down might bring Bitcoin down to around $6,000-6,500. It increasingly looks like the recent consolidation might be over and the move down might resume from here. Looking for Bearish Trigger On the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see that the move down of the last couple of days has brought Bitcoin to yet another Fibonacci retracement level. This time, we have the 78.6% level based on the move from around $5,500 to around $20,000 in mind. We have mentioned a couple of times in the past that this level is not a particularly strong one as far as the bullish implications are concerned. The situation now is slightly different. The 78.6% level might not be as important as other levels but the fact that we are now back at this level and that the recent appreciation has been denied might be taken as a mildly bearish indication. If we see a confirmed breakdown below this level, the implications might become slightly more important. Another bearish indication comes from the fact that the recent moves to the downside seem to have transpired on higher volume than the recent moves up. This might suggest that the momentum is now shifting to the downside as far as short-term action is concerned. From the long-term perspective, we are seeing that the recent rally might have been simply a correction within a larger decline. As no significant bullish indications have emerged and we have some bearish hint and the general trend to the downside, the situation remains bearish. If we see a bearish trigger , like a confirmed move below the 78.6% level, we might have an acceleration of the decline on our hands. Actually, if you consider the rising resistance line based on the February and March local lows, we might have seen a confirmed move down, a confirmed slowdown in the rally and a potential bearish trigger. Whether the decline accelerates immediately or we have to see more bearish confirmations, the current outlook remains bearish and the profits on our hypothetical positions might increase. We are looking for this trigger for you. Summing up, the tide might have turned and we might have more declines on our hands.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

With so many exchanges advertising their services, one can easily get lost in a miasma of confusion. Most users get confused on where to buy bitcoin safely because of the security concerns. Here are 3 suggestions for where to buy Bitcoin safely and securely: Buying from an established exchange\nUsing an established exchange is not only the easiest but also the safest way for where to buy Bitcoin. An exchange makes it possible to buy Bitcoin using your credit card or bank balance. The payment processors supported depend on the method of exchange you use. Most exchanges also have a digital wallet where you can store the digital coins you purchase. Examples of popular exchanges include Coinbase, Changelly and CEX. Buying using cash\nIf you do not what to share your information with an exchange, you can buy your Bitcoins with cash. There are a number of services that facilitate this. For instance, Localbitcoins acts as an escrow platform that allows sellers and buyers of digital currencies to trade anonymously. You can use their website to identify a seller near you and buy from them using cash. Take precautions to be safe though. Buy with Amazon gift card\nPurse.io is a service that makes it possible to convert your Amazon gift card into Bitcoin. Buyers post their wishlist items on the website and all you have to do is find one that matches the value of your gift card. You then order the item which is shipped directly to them. As soon as they get confirmation of the order, they, in turn, release the equivalent amount in Bitcoins. Funds are held in escrow to prevent fraud.\nDigital currencies are unregulated and this makes them easy targets for fraud. It is incumbent on you to do your due diligence to avoid falling prey to scammers. One way to be safe for where to buy Bitcoin is to only use trusted exchanges when doing trades. Also, ensure your wallet is well secured through strong passwords, two-factor authentication and all available security measures as advised by your provider.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR.

Therefore, the RBI cannot unilaterally decide for the government on the legality of bitcoins\nIn its response, the RBI also confirmed that the committee is due to submit a report on cryptocurrencies come June 30 and insisted that the working group will study the regulatory approach taken by other countries before proposing a regulatory framework in India.\nMeanwhile, despite mainstream reports to the contrary this year, bitcoin isn’t banned in India despite recent curbs led by the central bank which effectively barred Indian citizens from purchasing cryptocurrency through their bank accounts.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.

Understanding The Ban\nWhereas many see bans on crypto mining as a hindrance to entrepreneurship and the crypto house, really, it’s an effort to guard and improve cities, states, and international locations’ pure, historic, cultural, and electrical sources.\nAgain in March, a moratorium was enacted in Plattsburgh, New York, the first major U.S. city to pause any and all mining operations as a consequence of an operation that had almost drained the town of its electrical sources, on the expense of the residents who have been those paying for it. Plattsburgh’s ban stated that it might subject a penalty of as much as $1,000/day on any agency, individual, company, or different entity that established or ran a business cryptocurrency mining operation as soon as the ban went into impact. Why Is Russia a ‘Sizzling Spot’ For Mining?\nFor its half, Russia will quickly change into house to one of many largest authorized mining operations on the earth, positioned in Siberia. Earlier this 12 months, the Financial institution of Russia, Russia’s central financial institution, offered to permit the mining of cryptocurrencies, however proposed that miners promote their cash exterior the nation. The primary deputy governor of the financial institution emphasised the necessity to take a “taxation standpoint” and think about how it may be managed and reported. Nonetheless, promoting cryptocurrencies exterior the nation doesn’t take away the requirement that miners file and pay their taxes.\nOne firm, Minery , lately introduced that it intends to ascertain 5 mining complexes with a complete capability of 55 megawatts on a 59,000 sq. foot website inside the Irkutsk area. It has partnered with Bratsk Electrical Grid Firm JSC, a regional energy provider.\nThe corporate is taken into account a ‘turnkey’ mining answer, offering all mandatory {hardware}, set up, and configuration. Within the occasion of any service wants or breakdowns, the corporate makes the mandatory repairs on the spot. Such a operation turns out to be useful when participating in contracts with cloud mining suppliers, mining swimming pools, or third-party internet hosting platforms. Working on the lowest electrical energy charges, it’s nonetheless thought-about authorized in gentle of the insurance policies proposed by the Russian Federation and Financial institution.\nRussia’s vitality sources and local weather make for a number of the greatest situations for crypto mining. Consequently, greater than 1.5 million Russians have began to have interaction in solo mining (house mining). Doing so comes with nice dangers, as this technique of operation tends to trigger an annoyance and nuisance to these round, to not point out security hazards. Oftentimes, these operations are working illegally, and fairly than offering worth to communities, they’re draining them.\nFor instance, many unlawful mining farms are closed and people behind them are arrested. Why? Effectively, you have got (1) people stealing electrical energy that belongs to a delegated space and those that pay cash for it, (2) the land and premises getting used for different functions on the expense of space residents, and (3) gear being smuggled throughout state traces and worldwide borders.\n“Having been mining since 2016, we have now encountered restrictions [on] house mining, and got here up with an answer when it comes to scalability and authorized operations,” says Ilya Bruman, co-founder and CEO of Minery. “The thought is to construct a complete infrastructure, offering highly-efficient, highly effective, and a steady electrical energy provide for our buyers, guaranteeing easy operation of their mining companies.”\nUnderneath Russia’s proposed laws, the vast majority of such companies will change into unlawful. Minery shouldn’t be amongst them. Staying Inside The Volts\nThe largest subject with lots of the mining operations which are later deemed unlawful is that the electrical energy getting used is finished so with out authorization—usually draining cities and cities of this extremely used and worthwhile useful resource. It’s even gone digital, within the case of cryptojacking malware which assaults computer systems and servers, draining their CPU energy and sources .\nMinery’s mining complexes are positioned in a number of cities within the Irkutsk (Siberia) area – Bratsk, Irkutsk and Ust-Ilimsk. The native local weather situations – the typical annual temperature is 28.4° Fahrenheit, or -2° Celsius – are optimum for miners’ warmth switch and cooling techniques, which reduces internet hosting bills. The challenge depends on renewable electrical energy from high-pressure hydroelectric energy vegetation – the Bratsk, Irkutsk, and Ust-Ilimsk Hydroelectric Energy Stations. The vegetation are positioned on the Angara River, which drains Lake Baikal – the biggest freshwater lake on the earth.\nTo make sure optimum working situations, any mining operation ought to scale back vitality prices whereas sustaining the gear itself. “This objective is achieved by putting mining amenities close to the sources of the most affordable and most eco-friendly electrical energy – hydroelectric energy stations,” says Alexei Paikin, co-founder and managing director of Minery. “This method minimizes the price of delivering electrical energy to the purpose of consumption.” Russia Prepares for Massive-Scale Bitcoin Mining Operation Following Minery Launch was last modified: May 16th, 2018 by Editor Share on: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin news hub  with", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plattsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T05:43:31.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0d40a3ad0c1f3046fc1ad7a2d57415c310222c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOupe3OP3U3lnzF0ojQd6jS3NHamoxiALCYiq.vn_ANCdhEIRUV4beLetF4OSh.7o2mxsj144f9f340OsL.RgwVqCqfIXZMpg_", "site_full": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Rev-A-Shelf 6552-ETH-10 Euro Face Frame Tip-Out Tray Hinge, Chrome - Bitcoins Channel", "title_full": "Rev-A-Shelf 6552-ETH-10 Euro Face Frame Tip-Out Tray Hinge, Chrome - Bitcoins Channel", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.117, "main_image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pPkA6I5-L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0d40a3ad0c1f3046fc1ad7a2d57415c310222c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOupe3OP3U3lnzF0ojQd6jS3NHamoxiALCYiq.vn_ANCdhEIRUV4beLetF4OSh.7o2mxsj144f9f340OsL.RgwVqCqfIXZMpg_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rev-A-Shelf 6552-ETH-10 Euro Face Frame Tip-Out Tray Hinge, Chrome - Bitcoins Channel", "text": "5 Views\nPrice: $11.89 Rev-A-Shelf 6552-ETH-10 Euro Face Frame Tip-Out Tray Hinge, ChromeRev-A-Shelf 6552-ETH-10 Euro Face Frame Tip-Out Tray Hinge, Chrome Features: Includes two hinges Designed for long sink frontfalse panels” Features an adjustable opening of 45 – 90 degreesRev-A-Shelf6552-ETH-10 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chromerev-a-shelf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T01:06:44.060+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce7dd00fd33364e5bcc331dda0cc2e4ac2dd2b03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL92b9ckyu8cRa9visP0tppXbD2OldgeyL3L5E5CK._HmwRlOrF5qCf3fKopvNzcDU4khJ5I9UOCg6JE835RTcd3J2OguISfmVKAA4l.0A_qmJFYalX6BRQ0YhkkuwzM463iTqpCfX76.ZFOVgskyg", "site_full": "forex0127.com", "site": "forex0127.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Is This The Proper time to Acquire Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin?

And while digital currency is still not widely used or understood by many average consumers, Chicago's two main exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, became the first traditional exchanges to trade the financial products late last year, lending credibility to bitcoin and its lesser-known digital brethren.\nCoinbase is already one of the largest digital currency exchanges around the world. Coinbase's Chicago office will serve as a central hub for some back-office technology behind the company's products, said Paul Bauerschmidt, a former CME executive, who is leading the Chicago office.\n\"It's similar to an exchange that you'd see with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) or CME or CBOE,\" he said.\nRecruiting people who are able to build and maintain these complicated systems, especially with financial experience, is difficult in other cities, Bauerschmidt said.\n\"The talent that's here in Chicago, you can't find anywhere else,\" he said. \"And especially getting as many of the key staff as we need. It's really exciting to be able to build it here.\"\nThe Chicago office also will focus on courting institutional investors, which manage assets on others' behalf, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds or pension funds, Bauerschmidt said.\nIn concert with the Chicago launch, Coinbase is unveiling Coinbase Prime, a collection of tools and services specifically for those institutional investors. The products make it easier for these large investors to start trading and manage sophisticated trading systems, Bauerschmidt said.\nThe Chicago office currently has just six employees, but it plans to get that number up to 30 this year and reach 100 within three years.\nBitcoin's initial trading value was just pennies in 2010, surging to more than $17,000 at one point in late 2017. It's now trading at just under $9,000. At this point last year, a single bitcoin was worth about $1,800; two years ago it was $445.\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as an alternative to government-issued currency. A number of big companies accept it, from travel website Expedia.com to Subway sandwich shops and even online dating site OkCupid. But because it isn't regulated by a country or other single entity like traditional currency, the price can be volatile.

The movement has sped up over the past two weeks as Morgan Stanley has fallen behind in the headlines with respect to Goldman Sachs and others.\nThe conversations have been focused and the competition incredibly robust. In truth, GDAX and Gemini are locked in what looks like an epic battle to court traditional global investment banks as their clients kick and scream for services connected to cryptos. Gemini has had the lead for months, but Coinbase/GDAX is fighting back.\nMorgan Stanley. according to anonymous sources on background, has been engaged with due diligence connected to a client-focused crypto desk since late 2017. The firms’ lawyers have coalesced around risk management and protecting the firm in case of a crypto market meltdown. In fact, this deal would have gotten done sooner had the extreme downside volatility not occurred in Q1 of 2018. That being said, Morgan Stanley is close to pulling the trigger and allowing the news of a GDAX ‘market maker’ to find its way into the public domain.\nA second development worth noting here is this (and could potentially be bigger news than using GDAX to clear client crypto trades) – Morgan Stanley is also engaging several firms that are fashioning ‘crypto baskets’ that would look to the world like ETF’s tailor-made for crypto curious clients who are seeking diversification before dipping their toes into the volatility that is crypto.\nWe know of two firms that are packaging ‘crypto baskets’ with 5, 10, 25, and 50 coins at a time to ‘index’ the crypto market.\nMorgan Stanley is having meetings with those firms this week.\nThe GDAX news in the headline, but the longer term eye opener could be the crypto ETF products that are sure to follow.

So we're seeing participants come back to trading.\"\nEssentially, participants place a bet on what bitcoin's price will look like at some point in the future. If the price grows to that level within the time period, the participants recoup their investment. In the event that it doesn't, participants can sell their coins and receive fiat currency from the profit on that sale.\nThis is \"by far the largest trade that we've seen people coming in to do,\" Chou said. \"I would say that more than half our volume has been in this kind of trade.\"\n\"The contract that people are entering into here is such that they're selling an upside call option, so probably call it [two times] where bitcoin is now. If bitcoin tanks, they still collect the exact same premium and if bitcoin goes up then they end up selling bitcoin at about [two times],\" she explained.\nChou added that \"overall, I think the volatility is what impacts us ... the more [bitcoin's price] moves, the more fiat [investors] can collect.\"\nOnly eligible contract participants, as defined by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, can trade in these call options, however. Users need to undergo \"the same [know-your-customer] and application process as standard LedgerX\" participants, said Chou.\nShe concluded:\n\"I think given the price action people are going to be more and more interested ... we're very excited, because this is something we've seen a lot of on the LedgerX platform.\"\nZach Dexter, Juthica Chou and Paul Chou image courtesy Juthica Chou The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

In addition to claiming to have licenses in 38 states, the company also claimed partnerships with Bancorp, Visa, and Mastercard to issue its own cards.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nThree Founders Indicted\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Monday that the founders of a cryptocurrency-related company have been indicted in the Manhattan federal court.\nFlorida residents Sohrab Sharma, 27, Raymond Trapani, 27, and Robert Farkas, 31, are co-founders of a startup called Centra Tech. The company purported to offer cryptocurrency-related financial products including the Centra Card, a debit card which supposedly “allowed users to spend various types of cryptocurrency to make purchases at any establishment that accepts Visa or Mastercard payment cards,” the DOJ described.\nThe three were arrested last month. The US Attorney’s Office of Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized 91,000 ether which was “raised from victims as part of the charged scheme” in an initial coin offering (ICO).\nThe attorney for the United States, Robert Khuzami, explained:\nAs alleged, the defendants conspired to capitalize on investor interest in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. They allegedly made false claims about their product and about relationships they had with credible financial institutions, even creating a fictitious Centra Tech CEO. Whether traditional or cutting-edge, investment vehicles can’t legally be peddled with falsehoods and lies.\nICO Worth $60+ Million\nThe three began “soliciting investors to purchase unregistered securities, in the form of digital tokens issued by Centra Tech” through an ICO in approximately July. In oral and written materials, they falsely represented that Centra Tech had an experienced executive team and “had formed partnerships with Bancorp, Visa, and Mastercard to issue Centra Cards licensed by Visa or Mastercard.” They also represented that the company “had money transmitter and other licenses in 38 states, among other claims,” the DOJ revealed, adding:\nBased in part on these claims, victims provided millions of dollars’ worth of digital funds in investments for the purchase of Centra Tech tokens.\n“In or about October 2017, at the end of Centra Tech’s ICO, those digital funds raised from victims were worth more than $25 million” – the amount which has now appreciated to more than $60 million.\nFalse Statements\nThe Department of Justice found that statements made by the three to secure these investments “were false,” emphasizing that the three “were well aware of the falsity of such claims.”\nFor example, “the purported CEO ‘Michael Edwards’ and another supposed member of Centra Tech’s executive team are fictitious people who were fabricated to dupe investors.”\nThe DOJ then described the scheme used to fabricate the CEO and another executive:\nSharma text-messaged Trapani on or about July 29, 2017, that they ‘Need to find someone who looks like Michael’…Similarly, Sharma later wrote during that same exchange: ‘Gonna kill both CEO and her [another executive],’‘Gonna say they were married and got into an accident.’\nFurthermore, the company’s claimed partnerships and licenses were non-existent, the DOJ revealed, citing text messages between Trapani and Sharma discussing “Centra Tech’s lack of actual partnerships with banks or credit card companies.” Another text message from Sharma to Trapani and Farkas says, “Gotta apply for all licenses,” “Should I even say this.”\nFour-Count Indictment\nAccording to the Justice Department’s announcement:\nAll three of them are charged in a four-count Indictment.\nOne count is “conspiracy to commit securities fraud, Facebook Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sohrab sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert farkas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond trapani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us court indicts founders of crypto company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "centra tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bancorp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centra card", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mastercard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T04:28:34.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fc2767c62d482315a31fddc58e39a4d7abbe890", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw7IGOFcf1Xo_2oo2xJUMm8-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

It also makes the NYSDFS the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise Zcash.”\nLater in the letter, Winklevoss explained that part of the appeal of Zcash is a privacy-protecting feature that allows counterparties to engage in trade without knowing anything about each other. Called zk-snarks, the technology that can be added to any number of blockchains provides the same certainty of the Bitcoin blockchain but does not require that individuals using it know one another’s public addresses. The ‘zk’ stands for “zero-knowledge.”\nAs a result, the cryptocurrency offers privacy to those in oppressed nations, criminals, and privacy-focused individuals, drawing the attention of both supporters and detractors. In addition to Zcash having a $32.4 million daily trading volume, the zk-snark technology has been integrated into a number of open-source projects, most notably Quorum, originally developed by

2018 Taxation in Thailand\nBANGKOK – Thailand is toughening the rules about the use, exchange, or sale of cryptocurrency, and calling for heavy fines and jail time for unregistered exchange.\nAs of May 14th new regulations came into effect in Thailand regarding the trading of and profits from cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, which will see higher levels of oversight and taxation.\nCryptocurrency transactions will soon bear the burden of a heavy taxation, with a 22 percent duty on profits to be enacted soon, on top of the already announced 15 percent tax on capital gains.\nAlong with the new taxes, the sellers of digital currencies have also been told that they will be required to register with the national Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) within the next 90 days.\nThose who do not follow the requirement to register could face jail time of up to two years, but will also face fines of twice the amount of their transaction, up to a maximum of BHT 500 000.\nThe rules are expected to be expanded further to require all privately held exchanges, dealers, and brokers of cryptocurrency to be registered.\nThe new rules are expected to help the fight against tax evasion and money laundering.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sec",

Tim Draper, Renowned Investor: It’s Safer Than Fiat", "text": "by Jose Antonio Lanz\nYou may have asked the question: is Bitcoin safe? on multiple occasions. Should you really think to put your money into Bitcoin? Well, Tim Draper is an investor with renowned opinions about the cryptomarket. He is an avid believer in the positivities of crypto and his bullish position has earned him many followers and detractors. On multiple occasions, his predicted forecasts have proved successful despite adverse scenarios, and this is something to take into consideration.\nA few years ago, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would increase by more than 10k, a figure that only a few believed possible at the time. His prediction was met in about one year.\nA month ago, Mr. Draper also predicted that Bitcoin would cost 250k by 2022. Quite a controversial and yet not impossible figure compared to Bitcoin’s previous performance over time.\nThis Thursday, in an interview for CNBC, Tim Draper spoke about the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system. For the well-known investor, one of the most important aspects is that of security. If his opinion is to be considered once again, then it would seem that Bitcoin is safer than traditional fiat currency:\n“Right now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money. And the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away, but they are getting hacked all the time. No-one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. And so, as a store of value, it is a great place to be. And if you’re in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” Is Bitcoin Safe?\nThis statement is true, Bitcoin has never been successfully hacked but this still doesn’t make it infallible. Is Bitcoin Safe? Perhaps there could be the use of exchanges as trusted third parties to convert digital resources into cash — just like banks? However, there have been significant hackings into large exchanges resulting in multi-million dollar losses for investors, but this risk is equally there for standard banks. Hacking though in general, is caused by faults in the internal system of the exchanges, as well as by a security failure in the banks. Can it be really be considered a flaw in the actual economic system?\nFor this reason, it is always recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet (preferably a cold one) to avoid security breaches inherent in the use of third-party platforms. Mobilizing accounts to exchanges is only recommended for trading, and once finished relocating the crypto to a personal wallet is always recommended. So with that added element – an outside wallet holding your bitcoin, Its fair to say that that makes Bitcoin safer, whether or not more than fiat lies on several factors.\nYou can’t ask “is Bitcoin safe?” without considering another vital aspect that provides security to users; the decentralized nature of crypto. This characteristic means it is out of the control of third parties such as governments or economic influencers.\n“If you are in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30% every year because those countries tend to implode about every year, and people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into Bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.”\nThis statement is critical because in these countries inflation exceeds the Bitcoin’s price volatility. Taking Argentina as an example, the country is so incapable of paying its debt that it had to issue 100-year bonds to try to alleviate the current crisis.

Song is a blockchain skeptic whose personal wealth is unknown.\nThe details, Lubin said, could be ironed out on Twitter. The two shook on the bet on stage, amid cheers and hoots from the fully packed 2,500-capacity room at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in New York City.\nThe pair were on stage with Amber Baldet, the former head of blockchain projects at JP Morgan. Minutes earlier, she had announced her new project, Clovyr , which she billed as a “pragmatic connection between enterprise and public chains.” Baldet and Lubin were clearly on one side of the blockchain debate, with Song on the other. When Baldet asked Song what he thought of Clovyr, his reply was acid: “I didn’t see anything other than buzzwords. It’s like, let’s play buzzword bingo!” The crowd cheered.\nSong argued that nearly all the uses of a blockchain by big corporations could be achieved more efficiently with other technologies. “You’re a hammer-thrower looking for nails at this point,” he said. “Blockchain is not this magical thing that you sprinkle blockchain dust over it and it’s okay,” he added later.\nThe speakers represent two camps in an increasingly divided blockchain world. Song is a “bitcoin maximalist”—those who place huge weight on decentralization—while Baldet and Lubin are part of a growing chorus of technologists who believe private blockchains run by corporations and other hybrid systems will gain traction. Although ethereum has a native cryptocurrency, ether, its leading lights have also formed the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, to create versions of the protocol that could be adopted by banks and other big companies. Lubin’s company ConsenSys is a member of that effort. Bitcoin maximalists see these solutions as a watering down of bitcoin’s true potential. Lubin’s retort was that “layer two, sidechains, plasma architectures, sharded systems” would deliver on blockchain tech’s promise—the jargon-laden response almost underlining Song’s point.\nCrypto Twitter will be watching with interest as the bet between ethereum billionaire Lubin and bitcoin maximalist Song takes shape.

That’s where the fake protest comes in.\nAs the 2018 Consensus blockchain conference kicked off today in Midtown Manhattan, one bitcoin mining company apparently decided that the best way to make a splash was with a few shouts. As the event was getting started, a group of people could be found marching in front of the hotel hosting the 8,500-person-strong gathering. They chanted slogans like “hey hey, ho ho, Bitcoin has got to go,” and held signs informing anyone who passed by that “paper checks use less electricity!”\nAnd, as things often go in the world of Bitcoin, everything was not as it seemed.\nThe “protest” was ostensibly organized by a group calling itself Bankers Against Bitcoin, which, as you have probably guessed, is not a 100-percent real protest group. It does have real backing, though. Specifically, that of Bitcoin mining company Genesis Mining .\nImportantly, it’s not like Genesis Mining is trying to hide it. As the organizer’s website explains, the company wants everyone to get on the cryptocurrency rocket ship before it’s too late.\n“This protest is representative of what will happen to those industries and companies that fail to understand times have changed,” explained Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng on the Bankers Against Bitcoin website. “The consumer abuse that’s been possible due to a lack of competition is over. The biggest competitor big banks have ever faced has arrived and it’s not a company or organization, it’s a decentralized technology.”\nAnd Genesis Mining is here to help you avoid the soon-to-be grisly fate of the big banks with a “small,”“medium,” or “large” mining package for the low cost of $1,520, $4,440, or $12,960, respectively.\nAct now! Before it’s too late!\nWe reached out to Genesis Mining with the hope of getting a little more background info on what appears to be, in effect, a well executed publicity stunt. Were the protesters, for example, paid? Unfortunately we don’t know, as we didn’t hear back as of press time.\nBut that shouldn’t surprise anyone. After all, when it comes to making it in the world of cryptocurrency, simply grabbing headlines is often good enough.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

This is a $200 jump from where it stood just 24 hours ago, and investors are receiving a glimmer of hope for the future. The price bump suggests that bitcoin’s power is continuing to grow stronger, and despite a few ups and downs this week, the currency is finding it relatively easy to recover from negative hype. Granted bitcoin can keep up its momentum, we may witness the currency spiking into the $9,000 range again this week. The price had recently been marred by activity in both Japan (Mt. Gox) and South Korea (Upbit), but now it appears recovery is on its way, as the currency has incurred $200 to $300 spikes each day since its initial drop to $8,250 – the lowest it had been since early April. One reason for the sudden price surge comes from an unlikely place – New York. Recently, the Big Apple has garnered a reputation for being unfriendly towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency businesses thanks to the BitLicense , which was implemented in 2015. Many digital currency companies ultimately left New York or refused to perform business in the state, saying that they were being subjected to unfair fees and taxes. Today offers a different story. New York is now hosting a three-day event known as Coindesk’s Consensus Conference. The event is slated to bring in over 8,000 attendees, and with tickets costing as much as $2,000 each, the Conference organizers are expecting to make nearly $20 million in sales this year. The event begins today – Monday morning – and is occurring at the New York Hilton, Midtown. “It’s a bit chaotic in here,” says Ronnie Moas, head of the independent market research firm Standpoint Research. “I think they sold too many tickets.” The hoopla is a positive sign, to say the least. Over the last week, bitcoin has been subjected to newfound volatility, dropping from a new high of roughly $9,800 to less than $8,300 in just a matter of days. That’s a $1,500 drop in less than a week. This, combined with New York’s relatively hostile attitude towards cryptocurrency ventures, could have easily marred the Conference’s success. Instead, the opposite result seems to have emerged. So many people are trying to get in that organizers are now offering last-minute tickets to individuals for approximately $3,000 each. It’s a hard bargain, but if you’re that passionate about crypto, maybe it’s $3,000 well spent… Many attending reporters have claimed that it took them anywhere from an hour to an hour-and-a-half to garner their reporter badges so they could properly proceed. The line for entry spread across the hotel lobby, and extended onto a second floor by way of an elevator and stairs. “I’ve never seen anything like this for registration,” said Consensus attendee Jeff Denton, senior director of global secure supply chain at AmerisourceBergen in Philadelphia. At that time, Denton had been waiting in line for approximately one hour. “It’s expensive, but it’s the largest conference in the U.S., so hopefully that brings the value for the cost,” he added, stating that he was predominantly interested in learning how blockchain technology could be applied to healthcare. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:53:55.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35bb5cca1ccd053e3a8ceb3a39ce2bdd4e258542", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6okEPTVzFHaviLzYRNtQbqHM5gs21PVBg7aSsy2o6O98AX1f3xRNLKPUOp7.emAB0vjADJ34ZKaek_uXHAQeO0nmBLEYM9b29uZXmkpVhN.T_330V9kl3", "site_full": "whylose.com", "site": "whylose.com", "site_section": "https://whylose.com/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Lion Asset Management", "title": "Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’", "title_full": "Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’", "published": "2018-05-15T01:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://whylose.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cryptocurrency.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35bb5cca1ccd053e3a8ceb3a39ce2bdd4e258542", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6okEPTVzFHaviLzYRNtQbqHM5gs21PVBg7aSsy2o6O98AX1f3xRNLKPUOp7.emAB0vjADJ34ZKaek_uXHAQeO0nmBLEYM9b29uZXmkpVhN.T_330V9kl3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Floyd", "published": "2018-05-15T01:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’", "text": "Facebook Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’ Lion Asset Management Crypto & FX News Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’ Did You Know?\nThe founder of WhyLose.com has been a member of the Personal Finance Society and its predecessor since 1987.\nThe Personal Finance Society is part of the CII Group which was granted its Royal Charter in 1912.

Where there are payments to process or data to secure, blockchain technology can be extremely useful. Another exciting aspect is how it can empower the underbanked and unbanked populations of the world. Put simply, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are for everyone . These aspects are most apparent when they are evidenced by real-world people, businesses, and use cases. I recently heard about a Chicagoland orthopedic practice beginning to accept Bitcoin as a payment method and reached out to them. The practice was started and operated by Dr. Chadwick Prodromos, and he was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to talk to me about integrating Bitcoin into his practice. Dr. Prodromos Doctor Prodromos, how long have you practiced medicine and how long has your practice been open? I have been in the practice of orthopedic surgery for 32 years, and heavily involved in stem cell and regenerative medicine for 7 years. When was the first time you heard about Bitcoin, and what convinced you to add it as a payment method for your patients? I heard about it several years ago and read Paul Vigna and Michael Casey’s The Age of Cryptocurrency. I believed it would be particularly useful for international patients. The book used Argentinians as a specific group, for example. And I liked the idea of disintermediated payment in general and wanted to do my part to foster it. Actually, intermediaries in medicine – insurance companies, hospital systems, et cetera – are responsible for most of the excess cost in medicine. Medicine – healthcare – used to be much less costly and much more about the doctor and the patient without other administrative intrusions. Allowing cryptocurrency payments is a small step toward trying to restore that paradigm. And in general, I believe in the ideals of the blockchain community and wanted to be a functioning part of it. What was the greatest challenge in accepting bitcoin as a payment method? Greatest benefit? I am fortunate that my daughter Lexy works in the blockchain industry for Bloq and the Chicago Blockchain Center . She set up our system for me. However, it is relatively simple for anyone to set up. As far as benefit, this would accrue to any patient who wished to use this form of payment. As we treat more and more patients from afar, including overseas, with stem cell treatments, I think the benefit to them will be more apparent. How many patients have paid in Bitcoin thus far? How do they like it? Do you actively let your patients know it is an option? We had our first patient formally pay with Bitcoin last week. We have it as a payment option on our website. I intend, however, to actively promote it as a payment option for my practice going forward. How do your staff and colleagues feel about Bitcoin and accepting Bitcoin? Most had heard of it, but only vaguely. All were fine with using it. What are your opinions about blockchain technology as a method to secure health records and identifying information? Is your practice exploring that side of blockchain technology as well? Actually, medical records are already heavily protected with digital, encrypted, but non-blockchain technology. So there is no real need there from that perspective. However, there is interest in using blockchain technology to help keep provider directories up to date – a problem that is hugely expensive to the health care system. The current lack of transparency involved in that process would be greatly alleviated by having a blockchain [based] distributed database instead of the current centralized ones. What predictions do you have about other medical professionals accepting cryptocurrencies? I think it will grow slowly over time. There is still hesitation as to the use of cryptocurrency in a world where generally third party intermediaries are trusted in the United States. Some aspects of accepting cryptocurrency as well can be quite risky – for example, if a loss of private keys occurs or if there is a threat of an exchange hacking – so I can see the reluctance other service providers might have in using it. However, I am confident that as the technology becomes more sophisticated and user-friendly, user adoption will continue to grow. Outside of Bitcoin, what is your favorite cryptocurrency? Litecoin seems to have potential; I like the fact that the transactions process very quickly and it seems scalable. Also, I just read that Telegram, in a departure from their core business, will be introducing a new token that they think will be able to viably compete with Visa and Mastercard. Easier said than done, but I will be watching for more information going forward. Should our readers wish to learn more about your practice, where should they look? The best source of information is our website. The URL is ismoc.net . I am a knee and shoulder surgeon, fellowship trained at Harvard/MGH in sports medicine, and editor of the textbook for orthopedic surgeons on the ACL. I am also heavily involved in stem cell and PRP (platelet rich plasma) regenerative medicine injections. We have a prospective study of more than 2,600 such injections as an alternative to joint replacement and other surgery that is one of the largest by an orthopedic surgeon in the United States with an overall success rate of about 80%. I try to use surgery only as a last resort, and the advances in regenerative medicine have made this increasingly possible. Our phone number is 847-699-6810 for any questions. We are located in the Chicago suburbs but evaluate patients remotely from all over the country, and beyond, at no charge. * Dr. Prodromos and his practice are a great example of how cryptocurrencies can be used for daily necessities such as healthcare. I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Prodromos again for taking time out of his busy schedule to speak with me and to share his cryptocurrency story with our readers. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chadwick prodromos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prodromos doctor prodromos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicagoland", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:53:52.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5685950303fbb70c66e055c6778500e457efc31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCGR68Z4AT21U1ayThm8zfUBfMTEQyV7Bdx4alBo_oiCtPE_Q1Wlh.BSZp0isvoliW0jusL6AQRqJvHMV.b0FJHg--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Goldman Sachs Opens Bitcoin to Institutional Investors", "title_full": "Goldman Sachs Opens Bitcoin to Institutional Investors", "published": "2018-05-15T01:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526310500_15745069.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5685950303fbb70c66e055c6778500e457efc31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCGR68Z4AT21U1ayThm8zfUBfMTEQyV7Bdx4alBo_oiCtPE_Q1Wlh.BSZp0isvoliW0jusL6AQRqJvHMV.b0FJHg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T01:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Goldman Sachs Opens Bitcoin to Institutional Investors", "text": "5 hours ago Crypto and Laws Bitcoinist 57 Goldman Sachs will help institutional investors bet on Bitcoin price — but what will it do to the cryptocurrency market? Goldman Goes All In Following a slew of inquiries from hedge funds, foundations, and endowments benefiting from Bitcoin millionaires, Goldman Sachs has become the first regulated financial institution to afford clients the ability to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks, according to Forbes . What this means is that the Wall Street titan will essentially help shepherd the herd of institutional investors into the trading of Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs will not actually trade Bitcoin, of course. Rather, the bank will trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients using its own funds, in addition to non-deliverable forward futures. Such a glowing endorsement from the most profitable securities firm in history should undoubtedly signal confidence in not only Bitcoin but the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Fashionably Late The injection of investment funds into the cryptocurrency market comes after eToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan predicted a wave of Wall Street investment entering the space. Specifically, he explained that institutional investors were interested in catching Bitcoin at the bottom after missing the boat last year. Greenspan explained : So they were trying hard to catch that bull run, and it seems they did miss the party. November was a very interesting time […] I imagine that the clients in the Wall Street banks also wanted to get in on that party. Goldman Sachs is now chauffeuring clients to said party, but it remains unclear which direction these futures traders will push the market. “Whether they’re going to go full-on bull or full-on bear we don’t know, but the important thing is that they’re ready to take on and ready to inject new liquidity into this market — which at least should even things out and stabilize the price,” explained Greenspan. Beaten by BitMEX Goldman Sachs official entrance into the Bitcoin futures market comes after BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivative exchange, has already been offering derivative products to retail investors. As noted by Forbes , the exchange has a daily trading volume upwards of $3 million and posted a revenue of $83 million in 2017. In fact, BitMEX posted $21 million in revenue in January alone, when the market experienced a significant correction. Arthur Hayes, the company’s CEO said: This is the best thing you could ever have. We make more money when the market goes down. We love this volatility. What do you think about Goldman Sachs entrance into the Bitcoin futures market?

Companies are looking for ways to divest themselves of the traditional blockchain mining ecosystem. While once a perfect fit, mining is now running head first into scalability issues. Between advancing hardware and intense power consumption, the average miner can no longer turn a profit. The recent proliferation of ASIC mining rigs is even damaging the core concept of blockchain technology – decentralization. If a single entity can produce enough mining power, they can control a majority of newly minted coins. As such, proof of work (PoW) is becoming less attractive. In its stead, established projects and ICOs alike are looking to proof of stake (PoS) to offer a new solution. Rather than require arbitrary computations and shifting difficulties to meter the release of new currency, PoS relies on an investment in the project itself. Users that hold a portion of the currency can serve as validators – rather than a series of mining rigs. The Shift to Proof of Stake Ethereum is easily the largest project to plan a switch to a PoS algorithm. Their dominance of the smart contract environment put them in a poor position at the beginning of 2018. Transaction speed slowed to a crawl and mining fees started to grow. A proof of stake algorithm would free resources to focus on transaction validation rather than coin creation. Further, it would remove ASIC mining rigs from the equation – and the associated centralization that goes along with it. Many of the newer proof of stake coins use MasterNode systems. In these environments, users must possess a certain minimum amount to be considered vested in the project. At this point, they have proven their stake in the success of the coin and are considered trusted parties to validate transactions. However, this also ensures that only those with MasterNodes can collect transaction fees – leaving smaller investors out. Upcoming exchange DECOIN avoids this all together. Instead, every user that holds a minimum amount of their DECOIN currency is entitled to a return on their investment – proportional to the stored value and without the need for establishing a MasterNode. As such, they are using proof of stake as a means of sharing the value produced by their exchange – and to validate transactions on their blockchain. DECOIN’s PoS setup helps to create a community within their exchange. Users benefit from holding the native currency, while DECOIN rewards their loyalty to the platform. We’ve seen examples of native exchange coins in the past, but few have been so specifically integrated to provide digital dividends. Non-Financial Benefits of Proof of Stake While the internal benefits of a PoS system are considerable, there is also an environmental impact to the alternative. PoW algorithms and the associated mining ecosystem consumes an incredible amount of electricity. This electricity is created through a variety of means, but almost all require some sort of finite resource. Untethering cryptocurrency from mining will go a long way towards easing public fears about the industry. Considering at least one northern New York city has banned mining altogether, the shift may need to happen sooner, rather than later.
