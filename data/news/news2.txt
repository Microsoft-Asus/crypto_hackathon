Nevertheless, also other crypto-currencies are always popular. According to a report published by a global Broadcasting media house, the Bitcoin price in the short term, up to $ 6,500.\nIt didn’t take long, as the price dropped recently from 9.320 USD 7.350 USD. This was a significant decline. At one point it fell below $ 7.300. Several factors led to this Situation, we hereby want to introduce you to some of them. Lack of Momentum\n2018 has been a difficult year for the largest crypto-currency. BTC has so far experienced three major price corrections.\nThe first correction was made on 7. February, the second on 10. April and the third on 25. May. In the case of the first correction of the Bitcoin exchange rate fell from 19.900 to 6,100.\nThis corresponds to a price decline of more than 69%. The second correction was a decrease of 46% from 12,000 to 6,400 USD. In the third correction, the price fell by 28% (almost) of 10,000 to 7,200 US dollars.\nThe first correction lasted for about two months, during the last two corrections about a month to complete. On average, Bitcoin has experienced a five-month price movement. It is likely that the price will recover in a few months. Therefore, it is currencies of other Crypto in the long term, competition is fierce to supply.\nDespite the positive development plan, it is important to understand that Bitcoin and the entire crypto market is currently in a bearish market.\nConsequently, analysts like Willy Woo have predicted that BTC can fall up to $ 5,000. But this is possible only if the crypto-currency falls under the $ 6,500 mark, and the $ 6.800 brand no price support. At the Moment, it is unlikely that Bitcoin falls below the 6,000 $ mark. Altcoins and Tokens\nTo invest In a difficult Phase in an unpredictable market in alternative Tokens and crypto-currencies, is equivalent to the forced trade. This is due to the fact that tokens have been moving the price up and down. You are exposed to a massive price movement, the movement is similar to that of BTC.\nEthereum and Bitcoin currencies (in comparison with other Crypto) a relatively stable price in this bearish market. Quite the negative price movements, the two could not avoid, however. Other crypto as Zcash, ICON, 0x, and WanChain technological developments and other Upgrades, had currencies price experienced however, still losses in the last couple of weeks.\nCurrently, it looks as if investors and traders have a great selling pressure. Experts are of course not completely agree, many see limited potential for further large price losses and keep a price lower than $6,000 for Bitcoin to be unlikely. In any case, few believe that the total market capitalization of crypto-currencies under the $300 billion Dollar brand.

Currently, the price per BCH is around $1,120 after dropping below the $1K range the week prior. Moreover, since the fork this past May the BCH-ecosystem has seen all types of application development and community projects launched with a new announcement nearly every day.\nAlso Read: IMF Says Bitcoin Could Create Less Demand for Regular Debt-based Fiat Money Today’s Bitcoin Cash Statistics\nIt’s been over 10 months since the August 1 fork and today the BCH chain is roughly 7201 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain. Since then, the decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem has performed two successful hard forks, one of which changed the currency’s difficulty algorithm, while the other fork added new OP_Codes, and raised the base block size to 32 MB. Over the past year, the BCH hashrate has grown exponentially and this week the hashrate is averaging close to 5 exahash per second between roughly 12 different mining pools. This Friday, June 8, the Bitcoin Cash chain is 1.5% more profitable to mine according to Coin Dance statistics. Further Coin Dance data details that it is 5.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC network today.\nMarket data shows that BCH is down 2 percent today but has gained 13 percent over the last seven days. The market has a lot more trade volume today than a few days prior with $516Mn BCH swapped over the past 24-hours. The top exchanges trading the most BCH liquidity include Okex, Binance, L Bank, EXX, and Huobi. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth highest market capitalization still but also holds the fourth highest trade volume for June 8, 2018. The strongest currency pair with BCH is BTC which captures 41 percent of trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30.8%), USD (15.1%), KRW (7.9%), and ETH (1.3%). New Platform Announcements, the Miners Choice Initiative, and Development Funding\nOverall, the sentiment within the BCH community has been very positive, as there have been lots of announcements over the past couple of weeks. For instance, this past week 100+ coders met in China to develop BCH-based applications and organizers detail the event was a huge success. The Cryptonize.it team announced the launch of a new BCH-centric wallet called Cash Pay that allows anyone to purchase anything online. A few days later, the Cryptonize.it founder Ari explained to news.Bitcoin.com about how his team helped an anonymous developer create a new decentralized fundraising platform called Lighthouse.cash .\nEarlier this week, we reported on a “Miners Choice” initiative started by the mining pools operated by Nchain, and Coingeek which aims to remove the BCH dust limit if 546 satoshis, alongside allowing some free transactions per block. Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright spoke with news.Bitcoin.com about the initiative and he encouraged other mining pools to join the cause. So far since we reported on the topic, the mining pools Bitcoin.com and Viabtc have pledged to support the initiative. In addition to this, the Bitcoin.com pool has started to donate a fraction of block rewards to BCH development and has donated funds to the Bitcoin ABC development team this week. Bitcoin Cash Community Energy Still at Full Throttle\nOther BCH announcements include the popular streaming gaming platform Twitch now allows BCH tips by utilizing the Streamlabs app tethered to their Coinbase accounts. An encrypted messaging service was launched this week that’s tethered to the BCH network called Keyport . Bitcoin Cash was featured in the UK’s popular financial magazine Moneyweek two days ago in an editorial detailing why investors should invest in BCH. Last but not least, the trading platform Boaexchange has added BCH as their base currency and default values. The Coinex exchange is another trading platform that also offers BCH trading pairs with other popular cryptocurrencies. The trading platform Boaexchange offers BCH pairs.\nOverall, the BCH community is optimistic about the future and pleased with the latest developments and announcements concerning the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One unique headline this week came from the Philippines, as there’s a decked out customized BCH Jeepney that drives between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila every day.

The previous bullish momentum was capable of printing its all-time high near $20,000, but many questions have arisen since then, particularly in regard to regulatory grey areas. Adoption and compliance to governments regulation for the cryptocurrency market and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are expected to drive the price of Bitcoin upwards. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Bitcoin Could Shoot up as Coinbase and Circle Seek SEC License\nCoinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is attempting to become a fully SEC-regulated brokerage firm and electronic-trading venue in order to better navigate the financial system and become a valuable option for retail and institutional players. For that purpose, the operator has announced it will acquire Keystone Capital.\nThis move is evidence that regulation is smoothing out and could be an uplifting variable for Bitcoin prices, according to Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, in a note to clients. Here he calls the announcement an implicit recognition that the regulatory tide is shifting.\n“We believe the regulatory picture is now improving — best evidenced by Coinbase and Circle ‘running towards’ regulation. We are basing this on the notion that Coinbase and Circle would only take these actions if such was the case.”\nCircle, a cryptocurrency platform backed by Goldman Sachs, is seeking a federal banking license as it looks to make moves into the highly regulated realm of U.S. banks and brokerages. As of yet, however, no crypto-related organization has obtained such status with U.S. regulators.\n“We believe both companies would only make these moves if their perception of regulatory risks in crypto was improving”.\nA key issue yet to solve is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not decided which cryptocurrencies are to be considered securities. The regulatory body has explained that the Howey Test, created by the supreme court in 1946, is able to determine whether a digital token can be subject to the same regulations as stocks and bonds.\nSEC chair Jay Clayton has recently admitted that digital tokens from ICOs are securities. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has previously stipulated that cryptocurrencies are commodities and subject to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nAt the New York Blockchain and Digital Assets Summit, the SEC’s cyber unit division chief Robert Cohen has said the regulator does not wish to hurt the development of the ecosystem.\n“We want to encourage innovation and new ways of raising capital. If there’s a new and exciting tech people should have an opportunity to invest in it (…) Every time there’s an exciting new technology, people are afraid of missing out they see people becoming millionaires overnight, there’s a high risk of people falling victim to fraud.”\nAdding to Coinbase and Circle, Templum LLC has also registered with the SEC to operate as a licensed brokerage firm and alternative trading system. The operator plans to offer a trading platform for regulated tokens.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Currently, the price per BCH is around $1,120 after dropping below the $1K range the week prior. Moreover, since the fork this past May the BCH-ecosystem has seen all types of application development and community projects launched with a new announcement nearly every day.\nAlso Read: IMF Says Bitcoin Could Create Less Demand for Regular Debt-based Fiat Money\nToday's Bitcoin Cash Statistics It's been over 10 months since the August 1 fork and today the BCH chain is roughly 7201 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain. Since then, the decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem has performed two successful hard forks, one of which changed the currency's difficulty algorithm, while the other fork added new OP_Codes, and raised the base block size to 32 MB. Over the past year, the BCH hashrate has grown exponentially and this week the hashrate is averaging close to 5 exahash per second between roughly 12 different mining pools. This Friday, June 8, the Bitcoin Cash chain is 1.5% more profitable to mine according to Coin Dance statistics. Further Coin Dance data details that it is 5.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC network today.\nMarket data shows that BCH is down 2 percent today but has gained 13 percent over the last seven days. The market has a lot more trade volume today than a few days prior with $516Mn BCH swapped over the past 24-hours. The top exchanges trading the most BCH liquidity include Okex, Binance, L Bank, EXX, and Huobi. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth highest market capitalization still but also holds the fourth highest trade volume for June 8, 2018. The strongest currency pair with BCH is BTC which captures 41 percent of trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30.8%), USD (15.1%), KRW (7.9%), and ETH (1.3%).\nNew Platform Announcements, the Miners Choice Initiative, and Development Funding Overall, the sentiment within the BCH community has been very positive, as there have been lots of announcements over the past couple of weeks. For instance, this past week 100+ coders met in China to develop BCH-based applications and organizers detail the event was a huge success. The Cryptonize.it team announced the launch of a new BCH-centric wallet called Cash Pay that allows anyone to purchase anything online. A few days later, the Cryptonize.it founder Ari explained to news.Bitcoin.com about how his team helped an anonymous developer create a new decentralized fundraising platform called Lighthouse.cash .\nEarlier this week, we reported on a \"Miners Choice\" initiative started by the mining pools operated by Nchain, and Coingeek which aims to remove the BCH dust limit if 546 satoshis, alongside allowing some free transactions per block. Nchain's Dr. Craig Wright spoke with news.Bitcoin.com about the initiative and he encouraged other mining pools to join the cause. So far since we reported on the topic, the mining pools Bitcoin.com and Viabtc have pledged to support the initiative. In addition to this, the Bitcoin.com pool has started to donate a fraction of block rewards to BCH development and has donated the funds to the Bitcoin ABC development team this week.\nBitcoin Cash Community Energy Still at Full Throttle Other BCH announcements include the popular streaming gaming platform Twitch now allows BCH tips by utilizing the Streamlabs app tethered to their Coinbase accounts. An encrypted messaging service was launched this week that's tethered to the BCH network called Keyport . Bitcoin Cash was featured in the UK's popular financial magazine Moneyweek two days ago in an editorial detailing why investors should invest in BCH. Last but not least, the trading platform Boaexchange has added BCH as their base currency and default values. The Coinex exchange is another trading platform that also offers BCH trading pairs with other popular cryptocurrencies.\nThe trading platform Boaexchange offers BCH pairs. Overall, the BCH community is optimistic about the future and pleased with the latest developments and announcements concerning the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One unique headline this week came from the Philippines, as there's a decked out customized BCH Jeepney that drives between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila every day. The BCH Jeepney project was initiated by 20 BCH community members who donated 0.5 BCH each, and the bus plans to accept bitcoin cash in the near future.\nThe customized BCH Jeepney that drives throughout Manila. There's been a lot going on which has invoked a positive energy around the entire community, so far this fervor has been at full throttle.\nWhat do you think about the BCH market and infrastructure the past few weeks?

I don't actually read any post over one sentence long so I wouldn't know. Regulation may be a long way off. That's one complicated equation. And will it legitimize cryptos or will it stifle volatility? I mean who do think the \"robber\" banks sleep with at night. Yea, exactly, governments, politicians, reserve banks, other banks. And do you think collectively they want the crypto crowd to cut into their action? Of course not. My simple point was Bitcoin has been stuck in range for 6 months and suddenly it's... Ignored My wild guess on this crypto price may be anywhere for the time being but to the point of governments claiming what their actual crypto reserves are this is rating agencies job I think, of course you can not produce more than 21 million bitcoins but the main point is the sanctions disputes in the open and regulated market will be gone for the most part so that's half the problem gone for at least one group point of view. It will be somewheat more difficult to impose prosperity on a particular region and shake out commities as well. But the good thing is the internet communities will reset to 2001 era.

DPW Holdings (DPW) Uses Bitcoin to Reduce Debt; Shares Climb S.A. Team - June 8, 2018, 3:03 PM EDT SHARE ON:\nDPW Holdings’ (NYSE: DPW ) long-suffering bulls finally have a reason to cheer: The company announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining (SCM) has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis.\nDPW shares reacted to the news, rising as much as 23% in the morning before giving back most of those gains.\nSCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (Enertec), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide.\n“We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault emphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dpw"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dpw holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "author s.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shares climb s.a. team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "super crypto mining", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T22:29:02.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b1f8bbe18b132d886c7d981896ba3935b5c67b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVpeDdkEAba0Le9oxqICfD0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin become an asset", "title_full": "Bitcoin become an asset", "published": "2018-06-08T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.189, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b1f8bbe18b132d886c7d981896ba3935b5c67b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVpeDdkEAba0Le9oxqICfD0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kingkonjac", "published": "2018-06-08T21:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin become an asset", "text": "bitcoin`s mission was to be a currency and until a long time it was considered as a currency and is considered now also but the way it is treated is more like an asset and with those high fees of transaction it will remain to be treated as an asset.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T17:16:57.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbf3d8fd297defcd4c8c071244c0d28129e5a5cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdEh3Cb.3L_jIlk5myF4WuE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=192.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoins (Bahasa Indonesia)", "title": "🔥🚀 [ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown-Cryptocurrency untuk Pecinta Game online 🔥🚀", "title_full": "🔥🚀 [ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown-Cryptocurrency untuk Pecinta Game online 🔥🚀", "published": "2018-06-08T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbf3d8fd297defcd4c8c071244c0d28129e5a5cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdEh3Cb.3L_jIlk5myF4WuE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "suprex333", "published": "2018-06-08T21:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔥🚀 [ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown-Cryptocurrency untuk Pecinta Game online 🔥🚀", "text": "Quote: from: bitjoin on Today at 12:43:39 PM Quote: from: allfriends88 on June 07, 2018, 08:00:15 AM Quote: from: kincit88 on June 07, 2018, 07:37:38 AM Quote: from: fauzan Ichsan on June 07, 2018, 02:27:24 AM Quote: from: gaj ahmada on June 06, 2018, 09:14:50 PM Quote: from: kbhutto on June 06, 2018, 08:09:24 PM Quote: from: Falconer on June 06, 2018, 07:48:37 PM Quote: from: Pre55gopo on June 06, 2018, 07:44:48 PM Quote: from: bitcointemon on June 06, 2018, 07:40:49 PM Quote: from: novemberwoah on June 06, 2018, 06:26:04 PM Quote: from: sarfield on June 06, 2018, 08:43:28 AM Quote: from: kikukk on June 06, 2018, 06:15:24 AM BTCC sudah mulai di distribusikan.

Keberhasilan sudah diambang pintu dan nantinya akan berjalan sesuai roadmap dan mendapatkan market yang populer.\nSelamat juga ane ucapkan untuk partisipan bounty nya semoga hasil dari kerja keras selama ini bisa memuaskan dengan ratr tinggi di market nya.bagus juga nie proyek begitu selesai proyek nya langsung token di bagikan untuk peserta bounty nya.\nmungkin karena tim yakin banget jika ico akan berhasil sukses makanya para peserta yang join di proyek ini langsung di bayar meskipun ico belum kelar gan dan saat ico kelar tim tinggal mikirin market yang besar aja,, kerja tim memang sangat bagus coba aja semua proyek memiliki tim yang kerja cepat gini pasti para peserta yang gabung bakalan pada seneng\nwah manteb juga nih project bayar bounty sebelum ico kelar, ngomong2 kalo yang ikutan invest apakah langsung mendapatkan tokennya setelah beli ?\nkalau setelah invest biasanya ada yang sudah otomatis sudah transfer token dan ada juga yang transfer setelah ICO selesai, tapi kalau sekarang token sudah distribusi untuk bounty berarti investor sudah duluan mendapatkan token\nUntuk pendistribusian memang iya gan awal untuk investor baru bouny nyusul di belakang.Saya lihat banyak juga peserta dapat token di proyek ini dari kampanye telegram bisa dapat 12k.semoga rate di market nanti sama seperti rate ico pasti panen besar peserta bounty nya\nkalau telegram saja dapatnya sampai 12k token ya gambaran nya pasti nanti harga token nya bakalan receh gan saat masuk market, yang sudah sudah saja ikutan signature dapet segitu hasilnya tidak memuaskan karena harga token tidak mencapai 0,02 dollar, apalagi ini telegram saja sudah dapet segitu berarti yang signature pasti dapatnya bisa ratusan ribu token tuh. jadi ya gak mungkin jika rate nya nanti bagus.\nkalau dikalikan kan juga sudah lumayan besar itu gan. tetapi melihat kondisi saat ini rerata kalau pertama listing di exchange harganya langsung dump gan, betul kata agan bisa jadi tidak sampai segitu rate nya nanti\nLebih dari 50% ico tahun ini kayakny gitu gan, ketika masuk ke exchange hargany selalu drop dibawah harga ico tetapi harga banyak turun karena efek market juga sih yang sedang gak stabil...\nKalau rateny bisa tinggi bener\" wow banget tuh pendapatan para peserta dari proyek ini, apakah terkait market udah ada inpo listing dimana yah gan\nane lihat di telegramnya katanya ada di Bitox gan coba aja cek disitu dan yang terpenting untuk saat ini adalah token bisa mendarat dulu di wallet masing-masing peserta dulu gan.\nBagus juga jika sudah list di bitox, untuk harganya apa sudah ada yang tau !\nItulah yang di tunggu-tunggu dari peserta yang ikut di project ini berharap semoga token nya cepat di salurkan, dan saya pikir jika harganya greget di botox pasti akan langsung sale ni kayaknya\nBener gan, akan banyak yang menjual karena kesempatan bagus, biasanya kalau token dari game itu memiliki rate yang lumayan dengan profit yang baik. BTCC akan menjadi token yang memiliki rate bagus di Bitox.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:00:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2834b3ee6b0c85e5e130e8b9ec0784dc65cd857c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYW8YjggBtqdrTGOGvIOJfk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "title_full": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "published": "2018-06-08T21:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2834b3ee6b0c85e5e130e8b9ec0784dc65cd857c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYW8YjggBtqdrTGOGvIOJfk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cryptojaani", "published": "2018-06-08T21:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "text": "Quote: from: emezh10 on Today at 12:08:41 PM Quote: from: kauban2018 on April 22, 2018, 08:33:23 AM I just want to know how those people behind bitcoin secure the money they will invest because as far as I know there are lots of hackers all over the world.\nNo matter how secure bitcoin technology is, cyber theft are so clever that whenever you lower your guard, they are going to attack you on all angles, so, the best way to secure your bitcoin is maintaining your awareness and always have precautionary measures in terms of password and personal data related to your bitcoin wallet.

By: Bloomberg 6:38 PM To make his fortune on cryptocurrency, Jake Benson doesn’t have to choose a winner among the hundreds of firms hawking digital tokens. (Image: Reuters)\nTo make his fortune on cryptocurrency, Jake Benson doesn’t have to choose a winner among the hundreds of firms hawking digital tokens. He just needs to do their taxes. Benson is following the ’49er model — as in 1849. Like industrious shopkeepers during the California Gold Rush, he’s offering the digital equivalent of picks and shovels. In his case, accounting services.\nThe world of digital currency is poised to draw billions of dollars from institutional investors if it can provide boring back-office services like custody banking and trading systems along with tax accounting. While the functions are essentially the same as in traditional businesses, crypto presents unique challenges.\n“Just to name one difference, the number of decimal places in a crypto asset can be up to 18-plus digits,” said Benson, whose Libra back-office firm caters exclusively to the crypto crowd. “That fact alone actually breaks a lot of accounting systems.”\nHundreds of firms like Benson’s are competing to sell the nuts and bolts of the burgeoning market. Startups financed by venture capital and token sales are fighting for advantage as the field begins to get crowded. Like the sellers of mining implements during the Gold Rush, they plan to profit whether or not Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies turn out to be digital treasure.\nTraditional Solutions\n“What really excites me is this whole picks-and-shovels approach,” said David Wills, chief operating officer of Caspian, a Hong Kong-based provider of crypto trading systems and related technologies for hedge funds. “As long as the asset class has a pulse, those companies will be the ones to succeed.”\nIf established firms such as State Street Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. decide to do business with the virtual-currency world, it would lend credibility to the industry even if the firms aren’t that knowledgeable about crypto, said Morgan Hill, a partner at the $30 million Turing Funds in New York.\n“There are no off-the-shelf solutions from traditional finance,” Hill said. “Everything is still getting pieced together. The expertise in this space are people who got in early and have learned the pitfalls.”\nAt a trio of crypto conferences in New York last month, hundreds of companies clamored for one of two things, Hill said: investors in their initial coin offerings or customers for their back-office businesses.\nAlmost all the companies are startups, and most have yet to create what Hill calls an “MVP” — a minimum viable product. A few, like Libra, Benson’s firm, have been around a few years and are adding clients and staff as demand surges. The trick is to get customers to stay, said Caspian’s Wills.\nCreatures of Habit\n“Human beings are creatures of habit,” Wills said. “Once a trading system is built into your operational workflow, it’s hard to remove it. In crypto, there are many different levels of workflow that need to be in place.”\nWills said Caspian is planning to sell a so-called utility token that can be used to pay trading fees. It will also be used to compensate developers of applications available through Caspian’s system.\nSince money managers are required to keep customer assets secure, a pressing need is a custodial bank. Custody banks such as BNY Mellon and State Street would fit the bill, but they haven’t committed to crypto.\nJob Opening\nThat leaves the job open for digital-money companies. Omega One, an agency brokerage for cryptocurrencies that’s opening an office in Bermuda, says it will work with insurers and the island’s government to set up a custody business there.\n“Bermuda has an incredibly strong legal, technical, reputational jurisdiction for financial services in general, but particularly for custody of assets and reinsurance,” said Alex Gordon-Brander, Omega One’s chief executive officer.\nToday’s crypto scene looks a lot like the birth of the dot-com boom in the mid-1990s, Gordon-Brander said.\n“Obviously, not everybody survives the cut,” he said. “But it’s clear that the revolution is happening and the leaders are emerging.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "https://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "benson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake benson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T16:17:41.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "821d4ace890516ca715bbd80780be3dfa9019e24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseAxsZXTPBE6nxlL5fn9w25aSVp0o6awoKG.rGBKGs0cN0soXwEWcgk2UR..wk3YQDshVwsdX4kkB.rKhDGEEFDK.F_I8HfDiEW", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/real-time/feed2/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes Real Time", "title": "What is Next For Bitcoin $14,000 or $1,600?", "title_full": "What is Next For Bitcoin $14,000 or $1,600?", "published": "2018-06-08T21:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F1107991589%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "821d4ace890516ca715bbd80780be3dfa9019e24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseAxsZXTPBE6nxlL5fn9w25aSVp0o6awoKG.rGBKGs0cN0soXwEWcgk2UR..wk3YQDshVwsdX4kkB.rKhDGEEFDK.F_I8HfDiEW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Naeem Aslam", "published": "2018-06-08T21:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is Next For Bitcoin $14,000 or $1,600?", "text": "Investors are aching to see some kind of a meaningful trend emerging for Bitcoin.

Currently, the price per BCH is around $1,120 after dropping below the $1K range the week prior. Moreover, since the fork this past May the BCH-ecosystem has seen all types of application development and community projects launched with a new announcement nearly every day.\nAlso Read: IMF Says Bitcoin Could Create Less Demand for Regular Debt-based Fiat Money Today’s Bitcoin Cash Statistics\nIt’s been over 10 months since the August 1 fork and today the BCH chain is roughly 7201 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain. Since then, the decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem has performed two successful hard forks, one of which changed the currency’s difficulty algorithm, while the other fork added new OP_Codes, and raised the base block size to 32 MB. Over the past year, the BCH hashrate has grown exponentially and this week the hashrate is averaging close to 5 exahash per second between roughly 12 different mining pools. This Friday, June 8, the Bitcoin Cash chain is 1.5% more profitable to mine according to Coin Dance statistics. Further Coin Dance data details that it is 5.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC network today.\nMarket data shows that BCH is down 2 percent today but has gained 13 percent over the last seven days. The market has a lot more trade volume today than a few days prior with $516Mn BCH swapped over the past 24-hours. The top exchanges trading the most BCH liquidity include Okex, Binance, L Bank, EXX, and Huobi. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth highest market capitalization still but also holds the fourth highest trade volume for June 8, 2018. The strongest currency pair with BCH is BTC which captures 41 percent of trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30.8%), USD (15.1%), KRW (7.9%), and ETH (1.3%). New Platform Announcements, the Miners Choice Initiative, and Development Funding\nOverall, the sentiment within the BCH community has been very positive, as there have been lots of announcements over the past couple of weeks. For instance, this past week 100+ coders met in China to develop BCH-based applications and organizers detail the event was a huge success. The Cryptonize.it team announced the launch of a new BCH-centric wallet called Cash Pay that allows anyone to purchase anything online. A few days later, the Cryptonize.it founder Ari explained to news.Bitcoin.com about how his team helped an anonymous developer create a new decentralized fundraising platform called Lighthouse.cash .\nEarlier this week, we reported on a “Miners Choice” initiative started by the mining pools operated by Nchain, and Coingeek which aims to remove the BCH dust limit if 546 satoshis, alongside allowing some free transactions per block. Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright spoke with news.Bitcoin.com about the initiative and he encouraged other mining pools to join the cause. So far since we reported on the topic, the mining pools Bitcoin.com and Viabtc have pledged to support the initiative. In addition to this, the Bitcoin.com pool has started to donate a fraction of block rewards to BCH development and has donated funds to the Bitcoin ABC development team this week. Bitcoin Cash Community Energy Still at Full Throttle\nOther BCH announcements include the popular streaming gaming platform Twitch now allows BCH tips by utilizing the Streamlabs app tethered to their Coinbase accounts. An encrypted messaging service was launched this week that’s tethered to the BCH network called Keyport . Bitcoin Cash was featured in the UK’s popular financial magazine Moneyweek two days ago in an editorial detailing why investors should invest in BCH. Last but not least, the trading platform Boaexchange has added BCH as their base currency and default values. The Coinex exchange is another trading platform that also offers BCH trading pairs with other popular cryptocurrencies. The trading platform Boaexchange offers BCH pairs.\nOverall, the BCH community is optimistic about the future and pleased with the latest developments and announcements concerning the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One unique headline this week came from the Philippines, as there’s a decked out customized BCH Jeepney that drives between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila every day.

The Financial Times reports that there is as much Bitcoin (BTC) owned by short-term speculators as there is by HODLers, or long-term investors, now. Bitcoin Day Traders Catching Up\nBlockchain research company Chainalysis discovered the Bitcoin data. This data shows that the amount of BTC held by day traders has increased to 5.1 million Bitcoin since December 2017. Bitcoin HODLers, people who have held BTC for longer than a year, together hold around 6 million Bitcoin.\nWhile these numbers aren’t quite on par yet, the chief economist at Chainalysis, Philip Gradwell, believes that this might be a “fundamental driver” behind the biggest crypto’s recent price decline.\nGradwell explained that the growing number of Bitcoin day traders is causing a rise in liquidity for the coin, which could be part of what’s causing the Bitcoin price to drop. Whaling It Up\nOther data discovered by Chainalysis should come as no surprise to most. Chainalysis also pointed out that a large amount of BTC is held by Bitcoin whales. Whales in crypto are typically large corporations or groups.\nThere is around 17 million Bitcoin available and circulating. Of that, almost a third is held by only a few Bitcoin wallets. The Chainalysis data revealed that approximately 1,600 Bitcoin wallets each held about 1,000 BTCs, which, all together, would amount to around 5 million Bitcoin.\nThis may also be affecting Bitcoin’s price. It’s very possible that the Bitcoin whales could be manipulating prices (for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) to their advantage. If a whale sells some BTC, it’s enough to cause the price to drop, thus creating a chain reaction of FUD making others sell their BTC and making the Bitcoin price drop even further. Then, the whale(s) buy up even more BTC when the price is lower than they initially sold it for.\nThis may or may not be happening, but there are concerns circulating that this could be the case.\nWhat do you think?\n>> Crypto Bears vs. Crypto Bulls: The Who’s Who in Cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) Price\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently selling for $7,647.09, which puts the coin down 0.63% in

The Top Cryptocurrency Stories for June 8, 2018 While markets have been waiting for large Wall Street institutions to tap into cryptocurrencies, it appears that another big set of investors are diving in headfirst. John Lore, founder of Capital Fund Law Group, told Business Insider this week that a growing number of academic institutions are getting more involved with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Universities have billions of dollars in assets, and many are looking to diversify away from hedge funds and equities. Following Bitcoin's recent slide to $7,000, Fundstrat Global Advisors came out and argued a bullish case for the top cryptocurrency. Robert Sluymer, the firm's head of technical strategy, told CNBC that the market may have found its bottom. \"When we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000, and we think it's going to start a recovery process here,\" Sluymer said. According to a report out of London, the art gallery Dadiani Fine Art is working with blockchain platform Maecenas Fine Art to host the world's first cryptocurrency art auction. \"We aim to render the future of fine art investments to global reach. The cryptocurrency will broaden the market, bringing a new type of buyer to art and luxury,\" said the founder of Dadiani Syndicate, Eleesa Dadiani. Finally, Ethereum prices have dropped nearly 20% since the start of 2018, but analysts are getting bullish on ETH and expect it to climb to $800 by July 1.

(NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc., or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide.\n“We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault emphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.”\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.\nHeadquartered in Newport Beach, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc.

Some languages have died out because no one really uses it anymore. But English - is the language that is globally accepted. Think about it - even people, who never live in English speaking country, know 'Yes' and 'No' (or 'Thank you'). Plus, asian countries (they have own language) use English in academic research papers. Why? Because English is the only language that widely used (not just in one continent).\nMoreover, the language 'English' is the gateway for other languages. The first foreign language people learn is mostly English. Of course people don't need to learn English first, and they can learn different languages (altcoins) - but everywhere in the world uses/knows English. So it's good to know English.\nIf money is a language, Bitcoin is English. It's a gateway for other altcoins. You don't need to use Bitcoin, but you probably want to hold a little bit of Bitcoin since it IS accepted globally. I do not see any exchange that doesn't accept Bitcoin.\nHowever, I do not think Bitcoin would be the only currency, but I do believe Bitcoin will be the currency that will be accepted by EVERYONE.\nsubmitted by /u/singularityissonear\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T20:26:55.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ba367f7d5605b5b901535696ad676a365430043", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa3bulNuRjMOw5lcgk5Nk.ISfo0EkKslNyBzCiFUVZUBv7nChPEXlLMx9u9jJ9v0qhnD3dr_Eq3j1dVAmTFXtf_A--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "India’s bitcoin boom is fueling a surge in cryptocurrency crime", "title_full": "India’s bitcoin boom is fueling a surge in cryptocurrency crime : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-08T20:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ba367f7d5605b5b901535696ad676a365430043", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa3bulNuRjMOw5lcgk5Nk.ISfo0EkKslNyBzCiFUVZUBv7nChPEXlLMx9u9jJ9v0qhnD3dr_Eq3j1dVAmTFXtf_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fallenkeith75", "published": "2018-06-08T20:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "India’s bitcoin boom is fueling a surge in cryptocurrency crime", "text": "submitted by /u/Fallenkeith75\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://qz.com/1299642/indias-bitcoin-boom-is-fueling-a-surge-in-cryptocurrency-crime/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T16:15:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "976123e322bff72c889719280c41d08017de3a0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTN68u9e8ebZ9ROZxMz006I.AuJrJvV4iQPiWH0.zdSUWx3ZC04MT45kRkZ5li1WXmVau9o_Htwsw--", "site_full": "www.flickr.com", "site": "flickr.com", "site_section": "http://flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Uploads from everyone", "title": "PR: EO Obtains Licenses for Crypto-Fiat Exchange and Wallet as Its Initial Coin Sale Continues - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "PR: EO Obtains Licenses for Crypto-Fiat Exchange and Wallet as Its Initial Coin Sale Continues - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-08T20:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1729/42675643481_0f2c44dd97_b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 176, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "976123e322bff72c889719280c41d08017de3a0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTN68u9e8ebZ9ROZxMz006I.AuJrJvV4iQPiWH0.zdSUWx3ZC04MT45kRkZ5li1WXmVau9o_Htwsw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vipcryptosignalscom", "published": "2018-06-08T20:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "PR: EO Obtains Licenses for Crypto-Fiat Exchange and Wallet as Its Initial Coin Sale Continues - Bitcoin News", "text": "Vip Crypto Signals By: Vip Crypto Signals PR: EO Obtains Licenses for Crypto-Fiat Exchange and Wallet as Its Initial Coin Sale Continues - Bitcoin News\nThis is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material.

He first considered buying Bitcoin but decided it was too expensive More\nLast year I built my own cryptocurrency factory – in my bedroom. When the soaring price of Bitcoin started to be discussed on television and among my friends in 2017, understanding cryptocurrencies became a social necessity.\nEveryone was talking about it, so I was forced to investigate just to be able to participate in the conversations.\nThe more I read, the more intrigued I became: I saw that digital currencies were a platform for innovation – not just a way to make money but a possible replacement for existing currencies worldwide. As a 17-year-old at the time, I found the idea hugely exciting.\nHow I got started as crypto miner I spent a month last summer getting to grips with the different types of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple, and learning the technical terms.\nAt the beginning I saw myself as a potential investor and buying, like many others, into the currencies in the hope of making huge, quick profits as the price continued to soar. I could even see my Bitcoin profits funding my university course, which is due to begin this autumn.\nSo I was excited to get straight into the buying and selling of the currency – until I realised that a single Bitcoin already cost $4,000 (£2,980), which was well out of my reach. As I could not afford to invest other than in a tiny fraction of the currency, which seemed unappealing, I turned my attention to “mining”: making my own.\nWhat is cryptocurrency, how does it work and why do we use it? More I already possessed the makings of a crypto factory in the form of my own personal computer. I discovered that, when I wasn’t using it for gaming, my very efficient computer was perfectly capable of mining digital currency.\nHowever, I decided to invest in upgrading the PC with a faster graphics card, which would allow it to produce cryptocurrency more quickly. I spent £355 on one of the best graphics cards for mining on the market.\nI then found out that mining Bitcoin involved consuming extremely large amounts of power, so I decided to investigate other cryptocurrencies that I might be able to produce more efficiently.\nBrowsing online, I found a video about an alternative cryptocurrency called Zcash. It seemed to have all the potential of Bitcoin – advanced “blockchain” technology and security – but was much cheaper to produce. I found some free software online for mining Zcash and was ready to go.\nA Bitcoin mining machine in Canada Credit: Christinne Muschi/Bloomberg More", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aCZ2rp.IDFFSoZO_yrJPGg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/c77b489dfa05edac40ee817ecd7e39b9", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hSTWJ5M3W0y8_2_nxjHwVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/ce08d9e868b9f7df282a0f652e204374);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aCZ2rp.IDFFSoZO_yrJPGg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/c77b489dfa05edac40ee817ecd7e39b9);", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/what-is-bitcoin-everything-need-know-about-the-cryptocurrency/&quot;", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/what-is-bitcoin-everything-need-know-about-the-cryptocurrency/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c7R9LEnAzzes3ENkcLtrXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/59580a6909396658cfd5c6912d9ab6c8", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hSTWJ5M3W0y8_2_nxjHwVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/ce08d9e868b9f7df282a0f652e204374"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "demitrios achilleos", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:50:33.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cd5701ec588744fece805cb2f85ae714427f852", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY7muKyJ93NK2Hhcq40IOuiqjy74us1m4XRrU338o0TaOBDCsCqYacNjHDKKRctrDFw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Critic Jamie Dimon Says to ‘Just Beware’", "title_full": "Bitcoin Critic Jamie Dimon Says to ‘Just Beware’", "published": "2018-06-08T20:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0cd5701ec588744fece805cb2f85ae714427f852", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY7muKyJ93NK2Hhcq40IOuiqjy74us1m4XRrU338o0TaOBDCsCqYacNjHDKKRctrDFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T20:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Critic Jamie Dimon Says to ‘Just Beware’", "text": "After catching their breath, two of Bitcoin's biggest critics, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett, have once again spoken briefly about the digital currency, saying that investors should be cautious of it .\nJamie Dimon: 'Just Beware' Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and Warren Buffett, CEO and chair of Berkshire Hathaway, were speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box , yesterday in a joint interview.\nDuring the brief discussion on the cryptocurrency market, the two were asked which hated Bitcoin the most. After a slight pause from the two, Buffett spoke up first and said:\nI set a high standard. I don't know whether Jamie can top me or not.\nDimon then pitched in by adding:\nI don't want to be a bitcoin spokesman. Just beware.\nWhat exactly Bitcoin traders should beware about is not known, but the two have not been shy about expressing their feelings regarding the cryptocurrency in the past.\nLast September, Dimon made a bold claim when he said that Bitcoin was a \"fraud\" and that he would fire any employee found to be trading the cryptocurrency. Notably, though, months after making that statement, JPMorgan has launched a crypto strategy . The bank appears to be taking a keener interest in the market even if its CEO doesn't like it.\nClearly seen as softening his stance on the market, Dimon was reported as saying that he \" regretted \" making his comments about Bitcoin being a fraud. He went on to clarify, though, that he still wasn't interested in it.\nWarren Buffett: 'Rat Poison Squared' Clearly not one to miss out on taking a hit at Bitcoin , Buffett has also become known as one of its vocal critics. In the past, the Oracle of Omaha has warned investors not to get involved with it.\nUsing his creativity with words, the 87-year-old investor argued that Bitcoin is \" probably rat poison squared \" last month. When it comes to insults, however, Buffett's ranks at number one for originality. U.S. billionaire and vice-chair of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Charles Munger, has also called the number one digital currency a \"noxious poison.\" There's no question in doubt that the 94-year-old is not a fan of it.\nWhether you like Dimon, Buffett, or Munger, and the opinionated things they say regarding the crypto market, what they say is somewhat amusing. Of course, their opinions are often taken with a grain of salt. Yet, that doesn't seem to stop them from voicing their thoughts in the first place.\nDo you think Dimon and Buffett should just stop talking about Bitcoin?

(“Virtual Crypto”, or the “Company”) (OTCQB: VRCP), a technology company dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the TechCrunch Tel Aviv event tomorrow (June 7, 2018). In contrast to most bitcoin ATM platforms, which only allow the purchase of bitcoin, Virtual Crypto’s NetoBit ATM is a bi-directional platform that enables users to sell bitcoin as well, i.e. convert bitcoin currencies to regular fiat money, and to buy bitcoin, i.e. convert fiat money to bitcoin. NetoBit ATM is the world’s first and only ATM that allows real time conversion, purchase and sale of bitcoin. The product, which already supports most common currencies, is available for purchase globally. NetoBit ATM is the second product in Virtual Crypto’s NetoBit software and hardware products portfolio. In April 2018, the Company launched its first product, NetoBit Pay, a retail point-of-sale (“POS”) device that enables businesses worldwide to securely receive payments in bitcoin in real time, while enjoying protection against exchange rate volatility and guaranteeing transactions up to a value of $3,000. The cryptocurrencies ATM market, in which Virtual Crypto operates, enjoys exceptional growth rates. According to a study by Coherent Market Insights from October 2017, the size of the market in 2017 was around $14 billion, but it is expected to grow at a compound average growth rate of 46% between the years 2017 and 2025. NetoBit solutions, including Netobit ATM, are different from many other solutions in at least three ways. First, Virtual Crypto’s validation algorithm can very precisely and quickly predict if a cryptocurrency transaction will be approved immediately by a blockchain at the moment of the transaction, before the block is digitally signed. This quick process allows the approval of the crypto transaction within seconds to minutes, rather than between 10 minutes and 24 hours and following a process of six confirmations, as is the case today. This way, Virtual Crypto can create a pleasant and immediate transaction experience, minimizing the risk of fraud, which can occur in the usual lengthy transaction approval processes. Consequently, NetoBit ATM users can draw cash and transfer money from and to their digital wallets in seconds. Second, cryptocurrency trading platforms usually allow the customer carrying out the transaction to interact with only one crypto exchange, shackling the customer to the exchange rate which that exchange offers. Virtual Crypto allows the customer to work with several crypto exchanges simultaneously for each transaction. In this way, the Virtual Crypto algorithms can immediately locate the best crypto deal and offer the most attractive exchange rate while the transaction is underway. This ability enables the Company to protect the transaction from currency volatility that is liable to occur during the current lengthy transaction approval process and offer guarantee for transactions of up to $3,000. Third, the implementation of Virtual Crypto’s financial management system allows the operation of a large number of cryptocurrency ATMs and points of sale and provides tools that help manage and track the flow of money in each and every terminal. The back-office capabilities include setting currency price limits for each transaction, defining the KYC (Know Your Customer – customer identification), conforming to different regulations and configurations in different countries, managing risk and providing useful statistical data on transactions and points of sale. These capabilities are different from many other solutions that offer back-office capabilities which can manage only one transaction center. Alon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. commented on the announcement, “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from 10 to 60 minutes to several seconds. At this stage, NetoBit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T22:43:19.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d18a099b75ec973f0e8481e012042163f5c5629", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QVxtWoI94YHs.kn0BuqOCvTMrRUCQlX9rYI25fiiGIKS7Eaf857aDnC_7X7FD7NptK8zuFsvlPs00hOGZ0D8uLDZyZ6nFXMkHZCnD0FDbg2qxWealwq8vy", "site_full": "askkristi.com", "site": "askkristi.com", "site_section": "http://askkristi.com/feed", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Ask Kristi", "title": "$8000? $8500? $7250?

While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a “virtual human agent.” Also read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Bitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo Bitpanda , one of Europe’s established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option. “Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said. The trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions. Komodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future. Microsoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center One of Microsoft’s data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands . Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore. The data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider. Natick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean. Another strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented. Initially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users. Tokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain A Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a “Virtual Human Agent” (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind. A video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings. Couger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies. The Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome. Couger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments. What are your thoughts on the topics in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

But on the other hand, it is reaping the dark side of the digital currency.\nI think Bitcoin is very useful for criminals who want to hide money from their crimes. Because if they save money in the bank, the money from the crime can be easily traced. Bitcoin can also be abused by people who want to hide their income from government, and avoid paying taxes. Then, the state revenue from the tax will be lost because of the money that is not tracked. Not only in the criminal acts alone, the most basic lack of Bitcoin also occurs because of its unreal form.\nNot to mention the instability of the value of Bitcoin currency if converted to other conventional currencies are very volatile. Today, maybe the owner can be very rich by having Bitcoin worth 1,000 US dollars. However, who knows if in the future the value of money is only left 50 US dollars.\nsome minor events that cause huge losses for Bitcoin owners. A man once lost about 600 US dollars for doing a reset on his smart phone and in fact, he accidentally permanently remove the Bitcoin digital wallet.\nA number of online platforms are testing the payment with Bitcoin currency, among others WordPress, Reddit, Namecheap, Mega, and Zynga. However, some countries even banned transactions with Bitcoin. The Chinese government, for example, forbids all financial institutions from receiving Bitcoin transactions. While the EU rate Bitcoin more easily stolen. In terms of investment is also bad because the currency is determined only based on market demand and has a high fluctuation rate.\nThere are a lot of dark side In bitcoins almost everythingbhas a dark side in them but of course the dark side of the bitcoins are because of the dark minded people those who always commit bad things. Like for example those who used the bitcoins to do some illegal transaction those who sell drugs or other illegal things. Of course that will always be a part of the world because everything have that side even if you wanted or not you can always have that motive.

During a Bitcoin price explanation, Sluymer said that he believes there is “some very important levels coming up for Bitcoin literally in the next couple of days.” Even though Bitcoin’s price had failed to make the expected rally in May — one predicted by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee — Sluymer notes that Bitcoin’s longer term price trend is still “technically up” with $9,500 as its critical level. According to Sluymer, Bitcoin is now set up to “challenge its downtrend:” “When we think about what does it take to turn a security, a market, a cryptocurrency around, it first needs to bottom, then it needs to reverse through that uptrend or downtrend, and then it needs to turn that trend positive. In spite of the failed rally, Tom Lee stated in May that he still maintains his prediction of Bitcoin hitting $25,000 by the end of the year. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $7,592, down almost 1.5 percent over a 24 hour period to press time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T21:51:03.007+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 32008, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=200", "requestsLeft": 660}
