Do your due diligence before investing in anything.\nI may have missed the crypto bloom, being the last person in town to ride the boat. My involvement in bitcoin started just because I want to collect a free $10 from Coinbase (so kiasu) . And if anyone likes to send me free bitcoins, I have an address to receive. In the process, I found that cryptocurrencies are not as scary as I think. It takes just two steps and twenty minutes to set things up. Where have I been all this while?\nFirst, you have to create a wallet. A wallet is like a bank account where store the coins. Each wallet comes with a number and a key. The public bitcoin address is your account number to deposit money while the private bitcoin key allows you to transfer the money. Like your atm card pin, the private key should be kept secret.\nThere are three types of wallet: A cloud-based, paper and hardware.\nPaper wallet: I opt for the paper wallet because it's safer than cloud-based and it's free. This is the wallet that I use if I decide to store the coins for the long run. You could generate a wallet from an open source like WalletGenerator .\nCloud-based wallet: You could have multiple bitcoin addresses for a different purpose. My wallet at Wirex is like a current account to me. Here I store a smaller amount of coins for the daily transactions. It's a cloud-based address, and the security depends very much on the company. If you are a UK citizen, Wirex is one of the best crypto debit card provider.\nHardware wallet: If you like to invest in the best option, you could buy hardware wallet (USB like password device) like Ledger Nano S. Make sure you got the original Ledger.\nHardware wallet requires you to plug in the USB device to transfer out any coins in a wallet.\nSecond, the exchange platform You will need exchange provider if you want to buy or trade your bitcoin into other cryptocurrency or convert to cash. Like a bank provider, these exchange charges fees for transactions.\nThe most widely used platform in Malaysia is probably Luno and Localbitcoins . However, there are incidents where the government freeze Luno accounts in Malaysia. Coinbase is an alternative if you have VPN because the service is not available to Malaysia. The problem with most exchange platform is 1. History record of being hacked. 2. The clearance takes x-days on a volatile market.\nAll these platforms will give you a bitcoin address like a wallet, but try not to keep them inside for more than a week. I personally only use these platform to sell coins and transfer to a bank.\nCoin Mining If you are more interested in mining bitcoin, consider HashFlare . All my bitcoin are mined here. Mining is cheaper than buying a coin and lower in initial investment.\nThe risk of using paid mining service is you may not get any bitcoin if the mining company are fraud. I have only invested $9.90, and I have got my returns. It is more of an experiment than a real financial gain. Invest at your own risk.\nConclusion\nNo one knows for sure where cryptocurrency will be heading. I am in view that as long as people accept your coin for their service, there will be some value peg to the currencies, just like any other fiat money.

This is for security, because the private keys are all you need to spend the coins sent to the corresponding address, so they should be kept as secure as possible.\nSo if I go export keys it should have two keys? Or is the wallet the only key that will be exported\nYour wallet can have multiple private keys in it, usually one private key per address (at least for addresses starting with a 1 ). So the number of keys exported will just be the number of keys in your wallet. Your bitcoins will have been sent to one or a few of these addresses, other addresses might have no coins sent to them.\nand I can import that in to Bitcoin Core even though the imported key is not showing in the export and the keys, bitcoin address, history nor are my coin balances are showing in the wallet?\nYes, the keys are all you need in order to import the addresses into another wallet program like Bitcoin Core. The wallet will then calculate the corresponding address, and look through the blockchain for transactions sent to that address (as long as you import with the rescan option set to true ).\nI had 0 transactions. Just imported, checked how many I have and value and left it only with install and again before changing HDD did I check and it then showed the balance.\nWhat do you mean you had 0 transactions?

The tax agency demands in those letters that the recipients will divulge all of their involvement in the cryptocurrency market including all past transaction history and current holdings. People are being asked to list all exchange accounts and wallets they ever had and report their trade earnings. Additionally, the agency demands that people will reveal if they are engaged in mining.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General\nCheck Your Mailbox The agency appears to be be very confident in its suspicions as some local tax offices have not even bothered with sending out the letters with demands for information, instead they just opened a business case for anyone they think is trading bitcoin. Those people are simply informed they must pay income taxes as business owners now, fill reports retroactively back from 2013 as well as keep balanced books and report taxes on salaries to employees as any other business, as if they were restaurant or factory owners.\nEarlier this year the tax agency issued a circular on the matter, declaring that bitcoin is an asset, and thus anyone trading it must pay the capital gains tax of 25% and anyone considered to be running a business must also pay the VAT of 17%. The Tax Authority commented to Israel's Globes newspaper: \"Following the publication of the circular, which reflects the Authority's position on the taxation method of trading and investing in virtual currencies, the Authority is working to locate those active in the field who do not manage a case in the tax authorities. We recommend that those who conduct unregistered activity in these areas take advantage of the existing channels to settle their issues before they will have to endure the unpleasantness that accompanies enforcement. \"\nMonitoring Social Media Groups The Tax Authority is not exposing how it got its hands on a list of bitcoin traders in the country to check if they report or not, but there a few obvious ways. The banking system in Israel is very hostile to any bitcoin dealings, and the banks thus probably proactively report all inbound and outbound transactions involving known accounts of exchanges abroad as possible money laundering and tax evasion. And the few local trading avenues available to Israelis can easily be compelled to hand over a list of their clients with a warrant.\nInvestigators have used more creative means, however, people familiar with the tax scene told the Globes newspaper. They claim that undercover agents are monitoring local groups for peer to peer buying and selling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Facebook, Telegram and Whatsapp. The information gathered there is said to be sophisticatedly cross-referenced with other available data.\nWhat should Israeli bitcoin do with this information?

Only East Asia, Australia and Polynesia are still dark.\nThe presence of Bitcoin satellites in the atmosphere was announced August 15th, 2017 by Blockstream’s Adam Back.\nBlockstream is one of the companies funding Bitcoin Core development and building extensions on the network including a forthcoming ‘Liquid’ sidechain.\nAdam Back is a British cryptographer and “cryptography-hacker” who invented the hashcash proof-of-work system used by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin.\nBlockstream satellites could theoretically allow the four billion people on the planet with low-to-no Internet to access the Bitcoin network and transmit money in any of the areas covered. The cost of connecting a Bitcoin node to the network? About $100 US.\nThe Blockstream website states that the satellites use, “the latest open-source Software Defined Radio technologies,” which, along with the satellites themselves, “offer a breakthrough in the cost-effectiveness of satellite communications”: “Over the course of a month, a Bitcoin node downloads approximately 8.7 GB (gigabytes) of new blocks. As the cost of many internet connectivity options throughout the world is often based on how much data is transferred, running a full Bitcoin node can be an expensive venture. Until now… Blockstream Satellite…enables people to receive blocks at no cost, allowing more people to utilize Bitcoin and participate in the Bitcoin network.”\nBack told the audience at a recent conference in Toronto that Blockstream Satellite-accessing nodes are immune to Internet connectivity failures and will only experience a slight delay before re-synching if one of the network nodes fails. “Peer-to-peer networks like BTC can route around failure…(which) prevents any participating node from becoming isolated or partitioned,” states the Blockstream website: “Anyone in the coverage area with a small satellite antenna and an inexpensive USB receiver can receive these blocks and ensure that their (Bitcoin) node is always in sync.”\nForbes contributor and Hong Kong resident Leonard Weese has written that the satellites could help Chinese citizens to bypass their country’s ban on Bitcoin, a ban partly enforced by heavy-censorship of the Internet there.\nThe Blockstream website does not explain why the satellite intended to close the hole over China has yet to be launched.\nReese reported that in 2015, Jeff Garzik of Bloq announced his company would send 24 satellites into space to create Bitcoin “network redundancy.”\nAccording to Weese, the project never happened, but Bloq did rent satellite frequency from other providers.\nAnother company called MinerOne, who are preparing an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) procedure in which they hope to raise $200 million dollars to start a massive mining operation in Sweden, recently used a balloon to briefly launch a Bitcoin miner into space.\nWhile Bitcoin mining in space is not particularly required at this time, the incident did constitute an admirable instance of spectacle PR.\nFor the record, the cryptocurrency mining sphere is notoriously rife with scams and pyramid schemes and it is important to say that MinerOne’s mention here does not constitute an endorsement. ICOs also typically grant zero rights to investors. While #Bitcoin mining in space is not particularly required at this time, the incident did constitute an admirable instance of spectacle PR. Click To Tweet\nParticipants in a Reddit forum have examined the MinerOne company’s proposals. One commented about whether the returns on simply buying Bitcoin are better than those generated by mining through a third party:\n“They sell it as if mining is somehow less risky than buying BTC. This is in fact not true and perhaps more risky because you are exposed to the risk of ASICs going obsolete, completely blowing up your initial investment. But there is one scenario where mining is less risky. Thats when BTC drops. If you buy at $10k and you hold down to $5k, you lose. But if you mine and systematically sell it, you can break even from 8 months to 16 months. There will still be a break even point if you mine even if prices fall.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bloq.com/", "https://blockstream.com/satellite/blockstream-satellite/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonhardweese/2017/08/18/why-one-startups-plan-to-use-satellites-to-beam-bitcoin-data-around-the-world-might-anger-china/#ddecee01a886", "https://blockstream.com/2017/08/15/announcing-blockstream-satellite.html", "https://twitter.com/share?text=While+%23Bitcoin+mining+in+space+is+not+particularly+required+at+this+time%2C+the+incident+did+constitute+an+admirable+instance+of+spectacle+PR&url=https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2018/05/133274-the-current-state-of-bitcoin-in-space/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cali haan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam back", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockstream", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:42:41.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35abf905203efddcbb9f5af79384a199c3075d14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQrN.ar_9uysqXDNsRETefDTMIZCUSbGKUcaamF4tVOJr0Z0jCVk5yQ6zMyWeC5wOE-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones", "title_full": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones", "published": "2018-05-11T06:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35abf905203efddcbb9f5af79384a199c3075d14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQrN.ar_9uysqXDNsRETefDTMIZCUSbGKUcaamF4tVOJr0Z0jCVk5yQ6zMyWeC5wOE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T06:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones", "text": "Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese multinational communications technology company, has announced that mobile phone users will be able to download Bitcoin(BTC) wallets on new Huawei devices starting Friday, Bloomberg reported May 10. Huawei is releasing BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet in its AppGallery app store, which will be pre-installed on all new Huawei smartphones, according to Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com. It will reportedly be the first digital currency app offered on Huawei devices. Access to apps like BTC.com’s is limited in China as the government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some parts of Apple’s App Store. While Chinese authorities shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned initial coin offerings, people can still own cryptocurrencies. De la Torre told Bloomberg: It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there. In March, it was reported that Huawei is planning to develop a smartphone that will support decentralized applications (DApp) running on blockchain technology. Last year, Huawei shipped 90.9 mln units in the Chinese market, where it enjoys a dominant market share of 20.4 percent. Huawei’s global market share was 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement: From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future. Last month, Huawei announced the launch of a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform focused on smart contract development, “a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security blockchain technology platform service for enterprises and developers.” Meanwhile, China is planning to release nationwide blockchain standards by the end of 2019. A dedicated working group has reportedly already begun work on the project.

Worried that the process is too complicated? Well, fear not — trading bitcoin couldn’t be any easier. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to make your first bitcoin trade using SimpleFX. Getting Registered\nFirst and foremost, you will need an account to start trading on SimpleFX — and creating one is a simple process.\nSimply head on over to SimpleFX.com and click the green “CREATE ACCOUNT” button on the top right-hand side of the screen.\nYou may create a SimpleFX account using your Facebook or Google accounts, or use an existing email. Afterward, you will need to check your email address to complete the steps required for verification and the transfer of funds.\nOnce you’ve completed these initial registration steps, you’ll be ready to start trading! Make Your Move\nFirst, you will need to select your desired market from the left-hand side. For this guide, let’s assume you would like to start by trading Bitcoin.\nAfter clicking BTCUSD, you will need to choose a side — buy or sell. If you’ve already deposited bitcoin or another cryptocurrency into your wallet, you will be able to open buy or sell position (hopefully for a profit).\nHowever, let’s assume this is your first ever bitcoin trade. In this case, we’re obviously looking to buy\nYou will also want to choose between a market order — an order which is filled immediately at the current market price — or a pending order. With the latter order type, you choose the price you’d like to buy-in at, and the order will fill if and when that price is met.\nFor example, if the current buy price is 9399.04 USD, and you think the price of bitcoin will drop to 9200 USD, you may place a pending order at 9200 USD — which will fill if bitcoin market price will reach that level.\nNext, you simply need to choose the size of your order. You may purchase position worth whole bitcoins or fractions of bitcoins.\nThe trade value, required margin, and point value are all displayed for your convenience below the trade side box. Simply click the plus or minus buttons to increase or decrease your desired purchase amount.\nOnce you’ve selected how big position you would like to open, you may set prices for both profit taking and loss prevention.\n“Take Profit” is the price at which you would like to sell your bitcoin for a profit. For example, if you think Bitcoin will meet strong resistance at 10,000 USD, you may set an order to take profit at that price — in the hopes of possibly buying back in when it retraces.\nStop losses, on the other hand, may be set to minimize losses if the market should suddenly take an unexpected downturn. Many traders find these crucial, as it helps prevent large-scale losses in times of volatility and uncertainty.\nFinally, all that’s left to do is click buy!\nOf course, the process works exactly the same in reverse, should you be looking to sell.\nThat’s all there is to it. Now get out there and start making some money!\nWhat do you think of SimpleFX’s easy platform for bitcoin trading ? Do you use SimpleFX?

The tax agency demands in those letters that the recipients will divulge all of their involvement in the cryptocurrency market including all past transaction history and current holdings. People are being asked to list all exchange accounts and wallets they ever had and report their trade earnings. Additionally, the agency demands that people will reveal if they are engaged in mining.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General Check Your Mailbox\nThe agency appears to be be very confident in its suspicions as some local tax offices have not even bothered with sending out the letters with demands for information, instead they just opened a business case for anyone they think is trading bitcoin. Those people are simply informed they must pay income taxes as business owners now, fill reports retroactively back from 2013 as well as keep balanced books and report taxes on salaries to employees as any other business, as if they were restaurant or factory owners.\nEarlier this year the tax agency issued a circular on the matter, declaring that bitcoin is an asset, and thus anyone trading it must pay the capital gains tax of 25% and anyone considered to be running a business must also pay the VAT of 17%. The Tax Authority commented to Israel’s Globes newspaper: “Following the publication of the circular, which reflects the Authority’s position on the taxation method of trading and investing in virtual currencies, the Authority is working to locate those active in the field who do not manage a case in the tax authorities. We recommend that those who conduct unregistered activity in these areas take advantage of the existing channels to settle their issues before they will have to endure the unpleasantness that accompanies enforcement. ” Monitoring Social Media Groups\nThe Tax Authority is not exposing how it got its hands on a list of bitcoin traders in the country to check if they report or not, but there a few obvious ways. The banking system in Israel is very hostile to any bitcoin dealings, and the banks thus probably proactively report all inbound and outbound transactions involving known accounts of exchanges abroad as possible money laundering and tax evasion. And the few local trading avenues available to Israelis can easily be compelled to hand over a list of their clients with a warrant.\nInvestigators have used more creative means, however, people familiar with the tax scene told the Globes newspaper. They claim that undercover agents are monitoring local groups for peer to peer buying and selling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Facebook, Telegram and Whatsapp. The information gathered there is said to be sophisticatedly cross-referenced with other available data.\nWhat should Israeli bitcoin do with this information?

Bitcoin is set to continue down the path towards mainstream adoption thanks, in no small part, to mobile phone giant Huawei Technologies Co. On Friday, the third largest mobile handset maker in the world will begin affording their users the ability to download Bitcoin wallets on their devices.\nThe announcement comes from BTC.com's vice president of business operations, Alejandro de la Torre, as the BTC.com wallet is slated to become the first cryptocurrency app offered by Huawei's AppGallery. Explained de la Torre in a phone interview with Bloomberg :\nIt's a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there's a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the wallet will not only come pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones but will also be rolled out on older devices in the months ahead – meaning virtually all users of the third most popular mobile phone brand will become owners of Bitcoin wallets.\nPutting Bitcoin in the Palm of Everyone's Hands This move from Huawei most notably impacts the Chinese market, which doesn't exactly have a track record of being cryptocurrency friendly.\nDespite interest from Chinese citizens, the country's government has taken a hardline approach to the buying and selling of Bitcoin, outright banning exchanges earlier this year. However, Chinese citizens are not forbidden from owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nAs noted by Bloomberg , the government of China also blocks Android's Google Play Store and many sections of Apple's iTunes, which has effectively served to limit exposure to apps like BTC.com's cryptocurrency wallet. With Huawei set to provide said wallet to almost all of its users, lack of exposure will no longer be a problem.\nOf course, it's also worth noting that BTC.com is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies and is in control of the world's largest mining pool for the dominant cryptocurrency.\nWhat do you think of Huawei putting Bitcoin wallets into the hands of all its users? Do you think providing convenient wallets to the Chinese population will help facilitate mainstream adoption in the crypto-strict country?

If this is all done by the most efficient AntMiner S9 hardware, at 13.5 TH/s, then there are around 1.5 million devices.\nEach device draws around 30KWh each day, and they are probably paying around 8 cents KWh, for a daily cost of about $2.40 USD each.\nSo: $2.40 per day * 1.5 million devices = $3.7 million daily electricity cost How much is being earned?\nThere are around 144 blocks mined every day, with a value of 12.5 BTC, which currently goes for about $9,000.\nSo the total income is about $16.2 million every day. How low could prices fall before miners can't even pay their electrical bill? 144 blocks * 12.5 BTC * $X cost == $3.7 million electricity cost solve for X: X = $2,055\nSo, when the price of a BTC gets close to $2,000, miners will no longer be able to even pay their electrical bills. Then there is hardware, staff, maintenance, overhead, profit, etc. Side issues:\nI assumed the most efficient S9 hardware, but some devices are more wasteful. It is possible that more efficient miners will be coming out too.\nI used some of the lowest US costs for electricity. Its likely that costs in other countries are less. I also assumed perfectly efficient power supplies, but checking on some online posts, it seems real-world power consumption may be 30% higher than what I estimated.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T07:06:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f440cc0ffcda1ae75ec737c9cd65454485d2441", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRljdr8PFdejV3AmysxkO.E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] [BTCP] BitcoinPrivate: A Truly Private Bitcoin [Equihash]", "title_full": "[ANN] [BTCP] BitcoinPrivate: A Truly Private Bitcoin [Equihash]", "published": "2018-05-11T05:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f440cc0ffcda1ae75ec737c9cd65454485d2441", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRljdr8PFdejV3AmysxkO.E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pawelsalsa45", "published": "2018-05-11T05:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] [BTCP] BitcoinPrivate: A Truly Private Bitcoin [Equihash]", "text": "Quote: from: Islapdonkey on Today at 03:45:04 AM To any investor interested visit Zclassic thread/whalecoin thread to get a better idea of Rhett, the creator of BTCP or better yet research Rhett Creighton .\n And for the naive individual posting a pic of donkey. You do realize my moniker is I SLAP DONKEY . Thus I Slap fools, so when you post a pic of a donkey after i make a comment directed at you, you literally posting a pic of yourself SMFH.\n Oh, and again, this poor, broke and mentally impaired loser showed up and tries to discourage people from buying, holding or even thinking about BTCP. Dear loser, please read this post carefully cuz I'm not gonna repeat myself anytime soon. There is nothing wrong with the fact that people responsible for a given project leave it and go to the next one after a while, especially when the project is already mature has a growing community and is presented on well known exchanges. It doesn't mean that they leave investors with nothing because, their functions can be easily replace by others. This is just a business, like all cryptocurrency is, the risk is included and investors know it and no one is irreplaceable. If they they chose to do smth else, no problem for me, there is no way that the coin that is worth 30 usd as of now will not find decent programmers and developers in a near future.\n But to leave one project and go to another as a act is one thing, and exaggeration, discouragement and sowing of confusion on a public forum, the other thing. If you feel like being cheated that is your problem, not ours, I do not share your opinion and many other investor as well. I can wait a little longer for the coin to grow, when the situation stabilizes with new team and I understand that it was the risk I took when I decided to invest in this project. This is not a tragedy, it is called life! So please loser , stop spreading your stupidity and mental illness every second post on this forum, your opinions are created by your low capacity brain that is unable to process such simple task like comprehending reality around you! Be more positive , help others and one day you will notice that the coin you just invested in will gain you a huge profit!!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T02:36:02.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7968302d4f96d8822a20c9295d3c04d4c7b84418", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaj.uTHG4er3tSEwvqEk3y8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "What is the best Altcoin besides bitcoin?", "title_full": "What is the best Altcoin besides bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-11T05:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7968302d4f96d8822a20c9295d3c04d4c7b84418", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaj.uTHG4er3tSEwvqEk3y8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "coolstory", "published": "2018-05-11T05:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the best Altcoin besides bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: newuser20 on May 10, 2018, 09:00:18 PM In my opinion the best coin after bitcoin is the ethereum because it is believed and invested in it and now it shows very good growth\nEthereum is said by everyone when the best is asked after bitcoin.

Did Somebody Say ‘Mass Adoption?’\nBitcoin is set to continue down the path towards mainstream adoption thanks, in no small part, to mobile phone giant Huawei Technologies Co. On Friday, the third largest mobile handset maker in the world will begin affording their users the ability to download Bitcoin wallets on their devices.\nThe announcement comes from BTC.com’s vice president of business operations, Alejandro de la Torre, as the BTC.com wallet is slated to become the first cryptocurrency app offered by Huawei’s AppGallery. Explained de la Torre in a phone interview with Bloomberg :\nIt’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the wallet will not only come pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones but will also be rolled out on older devices in the months ahead – meaning virtually all users of the third most popular mobile phone brand will become owners of Bitcoin wallets. Putting Bitcoin in the Palm of Everyone’s Hands\nThis move from Huawei most notably impacts the Chinese market, which doesn’t exactly have a track record of being cryptocurrency friendly.\nDespite interest from Chinese citizens, the country’s government has taken a hardline approach to the buying and selling of Bitcoin, outright banning exchanges earlier this year. However, Chinese citizens are not forbidden from owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nAs noted by Bloomberg , the government of China also blocks Android’s Google Play Store and many sections of Apple’s iTunes, which has effectively served to limit exposure to apps like BTC.com’s cryptocurrency wallet. With Huawei set to provide said wallet to almost all of its users, lack of exposure will no longer be a problem.\nOf course, it’s also worth noting that BTC.com is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies and is in control of the world’s largest mining pool for the dominant cryptocurrency.\nWhat do you think of Huawei putting Bitcoin wallets into the hands of all its users? Do you think providing convenient wallets to the Chinese population will help facilitate mainstream adoption in the crypto-strict country?

Macau Almost identical to Baccarat with some added gamble, as two more betting features are available for players opposed to the usual Banker, Player and Tie; players can bet on ‘Player Pair’ or ‘Banker Pair’ meaning that player believes that the first two cards handed out will be a pair of either a Suit or Rank. The payout for a win on a Pair is 11:1, putting a lot of people under pressure to play it. If 8 or 9 is not obtained in the first two cards, a third is dealt in accordance to the rules, and if neither third set amounts either then winner goes to the highest card values.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts.

As reported by CCN , this has proven to be a “reliable long-term support level” for the flagship cryptocurrency, and future mining infrastructure development will “underpin bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.”\n“We expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple” (Fundstrat analyst, Sam Doctor).\nAlthough it is important to note that Fundstrat has always been quick to talk up Bitcoin, it is true that crypto-mining firms have been scaling up their operations following last year’s bull market (even after the crash).\nAs reported by CCN , Bitmain, the world’s dominant mining hardware manufacturer, “Is said to have made as much as $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, and Canaan — its largest competitor — is preparing to hold an initial public offering (IPO) that it believes will provide it with a $1 billion valuation.”\nThis, combined with the news that Wall Street’s biggest financial institutions (Goldman Sachs and The New York Stock Exchange) are, as reported by The New York Times , “Working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin,” should be enough for the digital currency’s advocates to continue seeing their bank accounts through gold-tinted glasses.\nAnd in the meantime?

Bitcoin is created through an energy-intensive process known as mining, in which computers receive the cryptocurrency as reward for solving complex mathematical equations.\nProcessing power to guess the solution is known as “hash power,” which Fundstrat predicts will grow 350 percent through 2019. “We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report.\nPerformance of bitcoin over the last 12 months Bitcoin traded near $9,300 midday Thursday. Last year, the cryptocurrency surged from less than $1,000 to above $19,000, helped by a flood of investor interest.\nConcerns about a regulatory crackdown have helped send prices lower so far this year. However, the economics of bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said.\nHe said bitcoin miners are more likely to hold bitcoin as its price falls to breakeven for operating costs, and sell as its price rises, leading to greater profits. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,” Doctor said during a conference call Thursday.

Chemin De Fer This variation is very similar to the original but players bet on each other as one player is determined as the Banker, where as the others act as the Player. The Banker then states an amount they are willing to lose and other players can either match the amount, meaning no other players can wager and they act as Player, or keep wagering until the amount is reached thus higher bidder is Player. If neither have an 8 or 9 then decision for a third card goes to players and then the Banker, a winner is then determined. Title of Banker moves clockwise to prior holder.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2GYokfZ"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "may/10/2018 chemin de fer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chemin de fer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T04:58:41.082+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6bccc88e856f58d1bfa53a40236403c09567a01b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRCFKr2BKzwIpdh0Xl9XfJQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is bitcoin secure?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin secure?", "published": "2018-05-11T03:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.046, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6bccc88e856f58d1bfa53a40236403c09567a01b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRCFKr2BKzwIpdh0Xl9XfJQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "t39", "published": "2018-05-11T03:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin secure?", "text": "Bitcoins are valuable because they are accepted as payment.

Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills to identify users on Telegram’s blockchain platform TON.\nAlso read: After Telegram, Viber May Be Blocked, Russian Minister Says Telegram Passport to Prevent Anonymous Crypto Payments\nDevelopers at Telegram are conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store personal data, according to sources quoted by Russian media. Telegram Passport will be used to verify identities of users on the messenger’s Telegram Open Network. They will be able to buy goods and pay for services on the TON blockchain platform with Telegram’s crypto token called Gram.\nCustomers will provide their personal details and documents, such as copies of IDs, passports, drivers’ licenses, utility bills, bank statements, and possibly photographs. Once uploaded, the information can be potentially shared with Telegram’s partners within the platform, but also on their systems, Vedomosti reported, quoting two sources close to the company.\nTelegram Passport, which may be launched by the summer, is expected to effectively prevent anonymity associated with crypto payments, which is a worrisome aspect for regulators around the world, explained Alexander Filatov, partner at SP Capital. His consulting company has invested in TON and facilitated investments of other interested parties.\nA number of partner businesses will be able to take advantage of the service. The Russian payments services provider Qiwi has already been granted access to the system, according to the report. The company is said to be cooperating with the messenger on the launch of Telegram Passport.\nInitially, only the users, not even Telegram, will have access to their details and documents. They will be able to secure the data with a password and two factor authentication. The company will use the information only with the account holder‘s consent, according to information shared on the closed pages of telegram.org cited by the Russian outlet. Once Telegram’s partners receive the data, they can verify it according to their own standards. Others are Working on Similar Concepts\nTelegram’s main competitors in that field are mature systems that use authorization services provided by third-party platforms via Google, Facebook, or Windows Live, said Dmitry Ufaev, head of the Russian operations of Bitfury, a leading manufacturer of software and hardware blockchain solutions. In his words, Telegram Passport will allow the messenger to circumvent these established services, providing greater privacy and data security to its users. This will be a reputational advantage, Ufaev noted.\nOther major companies are working in the same direction as well, and Telegram is likely to face hefty competition. The Chinese messenger Wechat has already implemented money transfers for users and service providers on its platform. The company is currently testing a digital identity verification system with face detection functionality which should be more efficient than verification based on copies of documents. The tech giant Apple is also working on its Face ID system.\nAccording to Alexei Prokofiev, partner at two venture capital funds, states will eventually switch to identity verification based on biometrics. “It’s a matter of digital sovereignty,” he believes. In his opinion, if Telegram does not establish relations with government authorities, it may fail to acquire licenses for providing services in jurisdictions where biometric verification is required by law.\nNews that Telegram is working on its blockchain platform TON came out in January. The company founded by entrepreneur Pavel Durov was able to attract investments worth a total of $1.7 billion dollars to finance the project. Goods, services and other content on TON will be paid with Gram, Telegram’s own crypto. Recently, the messenger called off a planned public initial coin offering.\nDurov’s company has been involved in a bitter conflict with authorities in Moscow following its refusal to hand over its encryptions keys to FSB, the Federal Security Service. Despite some interruptions, attempts by Russian regulators to block the service in the country have been unsuccessful so far. Russia’s telecom regulator Roskomnadzor has been trying to restrict access to the messenger since April 16 after a decision by a district court in Moscow from April 13.\nWhat do you think of Telegram’s plan to introduce identity verification for users of services offered on its blockchain platform?

Huawei is releasing BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet in its AppGallery app store, which will be pre-installed on all new Huawei smartphones, according to Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com. It will reportedly be the first digital currency app offered on Huawei devices. Access to apps like BTC.com’s is limited in China as the government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some parts of Apple’s App Store. While Chinese authorities shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned initial coin offerings, people can still own cryptocurrencies. De la Torre told Bloomberg: “It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.” In March, it was reported that Huawei is planning to develop a smartphone that will support decentralized applications (DApp) running on blockchain technology. Last year, Huawei shipped 90.9 mln units in the Chinese market, where it enjoys a dominant market share of 20.4 percent. Huawei’s global market share was 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement: “From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.” Last month, Huawei announced the launch of a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform focused on smart contract development, “a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security blockchain technology platform service for enterprises and developers.”\nMeanwhile, China is planning to release nationwide blockchain standards by the end of 2019. A dedicated working group has reportedly already begun work on the project.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/huawei-reportedly-seeks-sirin-os-license-to-introduce-blockchain-based-smartphone", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange", "https://www.statista.com/statistics/299128/global-market-share-held-by-huawei-smartphones/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-telecom-giant-huawei-launches-blockchain-as-a-service-platform", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-10/huawei-is-about-to-give-chinese-users-easier-access-to-bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/search?query=Huawei+", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-govt-reiterates-strict-stance-on-crypto-focuses-on-illegal-fundraising", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-will-issue-blockchain-standards-in-2019-says-govt-official", "https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinas-smartphone-market-declined-15-7-percent-for-q4-2017-idc/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "awei technologies co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese multinational communications technology company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T05:47:46.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8cb63663a2cb255a042b366638304278f09fcdb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.soAzHkr8fKK8S7IP694p.Q4Emudw0tgcP0u4oNMTcDkHhTCPE7R34snVekSvNbvlEg--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "It doesn’t work.

renew a nuclear deal with Iran, citizens of the country are turning to Bitcoin. Iran is facing renewed sanctions from the United States which could signal the start of new economic problems. There are also reports that the Iranian government is looking to create a state-owned cryptocurrency.\nImpending Economic Troubles Fresh sanctions from the U.S. will adversely affect Iran's exports especially oil which forms a considerable portion of its GDP. The country's currency, the rial has lost a lot of ground on the U.S. dollar. This decrease in value follows several months of forex shortage and financial difficulties in the banking sector. As a result, the local economy has been declining with the situation expected to worsen with the issuing of fresh sanctions. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has tried to remedy the situation but seemingly to no avail. The apex bank unified the official and black-market forex rates, but the rial has continued to plummet.\nIran Sanctions: People Are Turning To #Bitcoin To Get Money Out https://t.co/ascSmWuI17\n— Dennis Parker (@Xentagz) May 10, 2018\nA State-owned Crypto Solution. There have been numerous reports that the Iranian government is developing a state-owned cryptocurrency. Jayad Azari-Jahromi, the country's ICT Minister, announced in April that an experimental model of the local crypto project was ready. This announcement followed the ban placed by the CBI on Bitcoin and other cryptos. The country's apex bank prohibited all banks and lending institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.\nIf Iran does develop a local crypto, it will be following in the footsteps of Venezuela. The Latin-American nation launched its petro cryptocurrency earlier in the year. Many see the petro as a way of circumventing economic restrictions affecting the country. In response, the United States has banned the petro, and this will likely diminish its exchangeability. If Iran decides to follow the same route, its local cryptocurrency will likely suffer the same ban.\nBitcoin to the Rescue\nDespite the Bitcoin ban, Iranians are still using bitcoin to send money out of the country. According to reports in the local media, residents of the nation have spent more than $2.5 billion in acquiring cryptos in recent months. The CBI ban, however, is expected to significantly reduce the outflow by making more significant transactions a lot more difficult.\nMohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, the Chairman of the Iranian Parliament's Economic Commission, believes most of the crypto activities in the country are speculative investments. He also said that foreign cryptocurrencies are a threat to Iran's banking system. As such, it is necessary for the government to develop a national virtual currency.\nCan Iran navigate the problems brought about by economic sanctions using cryptocurrency?

As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Dandelion Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was first published in June of last year, backed by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, and several other faculty members and students from the school.\nThe proposal initially aimed to introduce a two-phase route for bitcoin transactions: “stem,” which is the transaction itself, and “fluff,” which is an obfuscation phase that would eventually obscure the original IP address of a bitcoin sender.\nHowever, following the proposal’s publication, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell pointed out that the tech may run into deanonymization over time, which means attackers will still be able to identify the origin by cross-checking transaction patterns.\nYet in the latest update, the team behind the Dandelion project have suggested a “per-inbound-edge,” which essentially aims to ensure Dandelion transactions sent from one node will be routed in different paths in the network in order to block the identification of traceable data.\nSubsequently, the team has built a prototype and moved to test the project on its own small network, finding that so far Dandelion is compatible with existing versions of bitcoin, the team said.\n“Dandelion does not conflict with existing versions of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin node that supports Dandelion appears no differently to Bitcoin nodes running older software versions. Bitcoin nodes that support Dandelion can identify feature support through a probe message,” the team wrote in an implementation document.\nDandelion image via Shutterstock\nBitcoin ProtocolBIPDandelion ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of illinois", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T03:59:07.094+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9385f53c8b35a6e9d373b53a2366b00ec7210dba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTyEdYUaFRuXbBYrzSkWxqO7ck50iuKmJeUQnzChaFigiNKtWHtFvc4BPJGnbOoJaz5BzyTPy_xyIgmkgk_Jedw9PeqcgNh6hUlwtQ4bjuuoOoMhjLr2BEHW9eC_mwJ3bACa2ENAE0KOq5dg8_g5yttqD3X9oUoFP7mC2kooG289zqDgcKJ9y7MCnOb3lwaGvsTbZQnV9Ky_48AM2APoWss", "site_full": "www.hostingdiscussion.com", "site": "hostingdiscussion.com", "site_section": "https://www.hostingdiscussion.com/vps-hosting-offers/", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult", "internet_technology"], "section_title": "VPS Hosting Offers - Hosting Discussion", "title": "Warez-Host.Com ★ Offshore Managed SSD VPS ★ NL,BG,RU ★ 15% OFF ★ Bitcoin Accepted! - Hosting Discussion", "title_full": "Warez-Host.Com ★ Offshore Managed SSD VPS ★ NL,BG,RU ★ 15% OFF ★ Bitcoin Accepted! - Hosting Discussion", "published": "2018-05-11T03:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9385f53c8b35a6e9d373b53a2366b00ec7210dba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTyEdYUaFRuXbBYrzSkWxqO7ck50iuKmJeUQnzChaFigiNKtWHtFvc4BPJGnbOoJaz5BzyTPy_xyIgmkgk_Jedw9PeqcgNh6hUlwtQ4bjuuoOoMhjLr2BEHW9eC_mwJ3bACa2ENAE0KOq5dg8_g5yttqD3X9oUoFP7mC2kooG289zqDgcKJ9y7MCnOb3lwaGvsTbZQnV9Ky_48AM2APoWss", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IWSNetworks", "published": "2018-05-11T03:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Warez-Host.Com ★ Offshore Managed SSD VPS ★ NL,BG,RU ★ 15% OFF ★ Bitcoin Accepted! - Hosting Discussion", "text": "Hi All\nWarez-Host was founded in 2007 and offering quality, reliable and affordable offshore vps hosting.\nWe have a rock solid infrastructure in place and guaranteed to serve you the next several years to come.\nWarez-Host tailored standard VPS Server plans to the needs web application developers, businesses, and web hosting resellers.\nAll servers are fully managed by our Expert Team according to your request.\nVPS Features:\n* Dual Processor Xeon E5-2440 v2 Servers, 48GB RAM DDR3\n* Dual Processor Xeon E5-2620 v2 Servers, 64GB RAM DDR3\n* Solid State Disk (SSD Servers)\n* Over 9 Years of Experience in the Hosting Industry\n* 24x7x365 Premium Support\n* Live Chat Support\n* 99.9% Uptime Guarantee\n* 1Gbps Uplink Port\n* Full Root Access\n* Competitive pricing\n* Fully Managed Servers\n* OpenVZ/Xen Virtualizations\n* SolusVM Control Panel\n* Real rDNS\n* 24x7 Monitoring\nNetwork & Facilities:\n* Fast, Secure and Stable Network\n* High Performance Servers inside Our Private Colocation of Europe\n* Choice of Network Location: Netherlands / Bulgaria / Sweden / Russia\nWarez-Host.Com Celebrate this New Year by Offering 15% Discount on VPS Plans for lifetime.

Here’s a look at some of the headlines that were moving the cryptocurrency market today — and which currencies were on the move.\nHeadlines\nFormer Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) President Gary Cohn told CNBC the world will eventually have a global digital currency, but it won’t be bitcoin. The ultimate universal cryptocurrency would be simpler to understand than bitcoin and would remove variables such as mining and electricity costs from the equation, he said.\nA new report from the San Francisco Federal Reserve claims the roughly 50-percent decline in bitcoin prices following its late-2017 peak of around $20,000 was a direct result of the launch of bitcoin futures trading. According to the report, bitcoin buying went unchecked until the futures market was launched, which allowed short sellers to take the other side of the crypto trade for the first time and drive prices lower.\nThe 2018 Cannes Film Festival kicked off Tuesday, and this year’s event features “Blockchain Corner,” with booths from six companies that are developing blockchain technology to help distribute films and protect against piracy. Companies in attendance include Cinezen Blockchain Entertainment, Cinemarket, SingularDTV, Dream Channel and TVZAR.\nPrice Action\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC (OTC: GBTC) traded at $14.61, down 2.4 percent.\nHere’s how several top crypto investments fared Tuesday. Prices are as of 3:45 p.m. ET and reflect the previous 24 hours.\nBitcoin declined 1.7 percent to $9,257; Ethereum declined 0.4 percent to $749; Ripple declined 2 percent to 81 cents; Bitcoin Cash declined 3.7 percent to $1,597; EOS gained 1.2 percent to $18.40.\nThe three cryptocurrencies with at least $1-million market caps that have made the biggest gains over the past 24 hours are:\nBitTokens: $1.1-million market cap, 175-percent gain.

One Bitcoin could be worth around $36,000 by the end of 2019, Fundstrat’s Sam Doctor wrote in a report for clients Thursday, noting that the value of the top digital token could range from $20,000 to $64,000.\nIt traded around $9,300 on Thursday. The researcher’s call was based in part on the notion that improving cryptocurrency mining economics support price appreciation.\n“Bitcoin miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees,” Fundstrat said. “We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” Fundstrat’s latest call comes three days after managing partner Tom Lee predicted the price of Bitcoin will rally during Consensus, a major virtual-currency conference next week in Manhattan that is expected to draw more than 6,500 attendees.\nAt the time, Fundstrat estimated that the top digital token will cost $25,000 by the end of this year, though its projections have varied substantially over time. The researchers forecast in January that Bitcoin would be worth $125,000 by 2022.\n— With assistance by Luke Kawa Read more from bloomberg.com…\n bloomberg.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-10/bitcoin-to-the-moon-refrain-grows-louder-as-enthusiasts-gather"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T03:24:04.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f602120efaf399afc0d2d14af3a70978efd1452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS9z._cFRy7NFbB4g.EsMeAhNUddhCg_DCFifg.thd_gx6RWfTyCeAvTkHrc5Sc3ttQ--", "site_full": "www.moneytalkvillage.com", "site": "moneytalkvillage.com", "site_section": "http://www.moneytalkvillage.com/external.php?s=413ac4c392919d00c44cab303e72d096&type=RSS2&forumids=42", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "MoneyTalkVillage - Payment Processors / Digital ECurrencies", "title": "BITCOIN", "title_full": "BITCOIN", "published": "2018-05-11T03:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f602120efaf399afc0d2d14af3a70978efd1452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS9z._cFRy7NFbB4g.EsMeAhNUddhCg_DCFifg.thd_gx6RWfTyCeAvTkHrc5Sc3ttQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "megathinker", "published": "2018-05-11T03:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN", "text": "Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts BITCOIN Bitcoin is an international electronic currency.

Bitcoin has experienced close to 0% gain in the last 7-day average. It has been very unstable in the range of -2% to +2% today. It keeps dropping and increasing between this range.\nBitcoin, which recently was very close to crossing the $10000 mark is now seeing a very neutral growth rate. It surges at 0.77% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.\nThe price has been more or less the same throughout the day, it has surged and declined with a difference of 100 odd dollars. Ranging between, $9250 and $9350, the price has taken a hit since May 6th and since that day has declined by around $600.\nThe current 7-day average hangs in a balance because of the surge Bitcoin experienced in the first 3 days of the week and the decline it experienced in the last 4 days. Both the surge and the decline are complementing each other really well to keep the 7-day average close to 0. Even in the last 1 hour, Bitcoin has surged only by 0.12% but it is the first time in the day that Bitcoin witnessed green numbers next to its name on the 1 hour scale, 24 hour scale and 7 day scale at the same time.\nAs far as today is concerned, Bitcoin seems like a very stable cryptocurrency. It has not seen breathtaking surges or declines. Many Bitcoin followers have come compared today’s performance to that of a traditional market security.\nGeorge Kennedy tweeted:\n“Oh my God! The future is here, Bitcoin is stable, this stability allows it to enter the mainstream so Fuck the people who said its instability will never allow it to be a mainstream currency.”\nMany experts believe that a fall back to $9000 or below is highly possible despite the neutral performance given the bearish market. Other cryptocurrencies have suffered quite a bit from this bearish market but the biggest hit was taken by optimists who believed that Bitcoin would cross $10000 and now a likelihood of the speculation of it falling back to $9000 coming true will leave these optimists flabbergasted.\nAman Swami is an Economics major from Christ University.

Required fields are marked * Comment Bitcoin [BTC] versus Bitcoin Cash [BCH], the fiery debate continues with insights from Vinny Lingham\nPublished Aman Swami Source: Wikipedia\nCivic CEO popularly known as the Bitcoin Oracle, Vinny Lingham, has weighed in on the Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash debate.\nLingham has been involved in the cryptocurrency industry for years and describes himself as an active investor focused on blockchain technology projects.\nLingham’s Civic is an identity verification project which allows users to prove their identity with blockchain technology.\nThe debate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash advocates has raged since the inception of the ‘Cash’ cryptocurrency during a hard fork in 2017. Proponents of both coins laud their cryptocurrency as the one true Bitcoin, often pointing out the limitations of the opposing technology to substantiate their claims.\nOne of the major differences between the two blockchains is their approach towards scaling. While Bitcoin opts to implement Segregated Witness and second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, Bitcoin Cash relies on increased block sizes.\nCurrently, Bitcoin Cash is a lot cheaper to transfer and use, while Bitcoin is perceived to be more stable and widespread.\nLingham said:\n“At the moment, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are focusing on two completely different markets. Bitcoin Cash is most commonly used for fast payments, as a medium of exchange, and Bitcoin is the better suited for store of value, in my opinion”\nHe added:\n“When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold, given the size and velocity of the markets.”\nHe further said that however there is still uncertainty about the potential adoption of Bitcoin Cash. It remains to be seen if the network effect around Bitcoin Cash can grow faster than Bitcoin’s. The question remains about Bitcoin Cash’s capability to catch up to Bitcoin if it focuses just on payments.\nBitcoin Cash is designed to function as a substitute, and possible replacement, for cash as it offers fungibility and security. While cryptocurrencies have steadily gained the attention of mainstream consumers, Lingham said there is a long way to go before they could replace cash as a medium of exchange.\nHe said what we are seeing now is the beginning of a token economy.\nLingham says:\n“Blockchain technologies are changing the way the world functions, and I believe this is just the beginning of the token economy. The adoption of the infrastructure, the cost of transactions and network security will be in relation to primary value of the token infrastructure. It will not be pegged to the value of the underlying assets on that network, but rather the activity levels for trading those assets”\nHe predicted the demand for Ethereum and Bitcoin would rise on fiat-to-crypto exchanges in the short term, leading to possible widespread adoption and utilization of the technology in mainstream applications.\nLingham concluded:\n“Given that these token assets can typically only be purchased on exchanges that accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum will rise at the fiat onramps.
