However, if you feel the city is too crowded, this resident is entirely different.\ndx.exchange, to be released next month, is the first crypto data exchange, powered by NASDAQ . “The advantage of this cooperation is threefold: brand name, technology, and regulations,” said DX Exchange Executive Director Daniel Skowronski , commenting on the issue exclusively for Finance Magistrates.\nWhile the first advantage is very explicable , Daniel Skowronski further explained that their technology would be based on the NASDAQ infrastructure, such as the matching engine used by over 70 exchanges around the world. Not for US clients, for now\nRegarding regulations, Skowronski remarked that working with NASDAQ mandates means that exchange meets the highest regulatory standards, thus avoiding frequent errors and bugs, such as double counting, and will generally prevent false volume.\nThe standards mentioned above include a recently acquired Estonian license, as well as a market license from the Cypriot regulator, CySEC. This framework will allow DX to offer its customers the full range of crypto trading options and to hold funds and customer deposits.\nUS clients will be rejected from the platform approach at this time. Still, management is currently engaged in a dialogue with US regulators to obtain a federal license. Vetting the Coins\nThe exchange will allow clients to buy crypto with fiat money, token-to-token trading as well as convert the coins back into the fiat and withdraw them.\nWe have created a one-stop shop for fiat and crypto exchange, which has coins and wallet services, Skowronski notes.\nAt first, the platform is scheduled to include the top six coins, such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin.\nIn the second phase, the top 20-25 coins will be presented, as well as some smaller tokens “both utility and security.” We support blockchain technology. Moreover, how we can contribute to the progress of this ecosystem is by checking the tokens and ensuring that the good ones are promoted. We will not list coins, just because they pay us. Those who are worthy will be posted.\nNew coins wishing to apply for listings will go through a three-step process: Initial Application Interview A legal opinion by the in-house team and due diligence: inspecting the team and the whitepaper.\nThe platform will not charge fees for trading transactions, but traders will pay a monthly fee of about 10 euros per month.\nAccording to Skowronski, KYC process will be done by sending an email and a phone number and is expected to be very fast and friendly.\nWithout undermining the required KYC and AML components needed by the regulator, he writes.\nCybersecurity is another primary concern of crypto exchanges, as we have seen in many cases. This issue will also be addressed with the NASDAQ infrastructure, and Skowronski promises to hire the best specialists in the field to avoid hacking and other malware attacks.\nPeople are looking for safety and security. We try to be very clear, so customers know what they get.\nThe platform also provides an internal conversation that will allow users to interact and share views as well as aggregate news and coin information. European license, Israeli R&D\nThree veterans of the trade industry lead the company. Skowronski was CEO and general manager at OANDA Europe and America. COO Raz Kaplan was previously Head of Risk Management at SpotBroker. Moreover, CTO Yaron Ben Shoshan was Director of Strategic Development at Forex Manage.\nDX Exchange hired a large team of 72 employees in Israel for its R & D team, which will lead the foundation, as well as its future development.

Bitfury has hired Michael DuBose, the former head of the Computer Crime unit at the U.S. Department of Justice, to roll out its bitcoin blockchain tracking product, Crystal.\nDuBose said in a statement: Sponsored Links\n“Crystal makes it much easier to identify and track criminal activities on the blockchain, thereby providing a vital service to law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, and other groups.”\nDuBose, an attorney who graduated from Harvard Law School, added, “I look forward to helping those groups identify bad actors and build a more secure bitcoin blockchain.” ‘Risk-Scoring System’\nBitfury, a provider of bitcoin mining hardware, launched Crystal in January 2018, as BTCManager previously reported.\nCrystal tracks and scores transactions on the bitcoin blockchain to identify suspicious transactions that could be associated with illegal activities such as illicit drug sales or money-laundering.\nThe company said:\n“Crystal was designed to be used by law enforcement agencies to track suspicious bitcoin transactions to real-world entities and determine relationships between criminal actors.” (YouTube)\nBitfury CEO Valery Vavilov said the cryptocurrency industry needs a user-friendly way to track bitcoin transactions and to determine if a bitcoin address is legit.\nVavilov said:\n“Public blockchains have the potential to fundamentally improve our day-to-day lives and be strong forces for social good.Unfortunately, there are people who exploit public blockchains and take advantage of their pseudonymity to commit crimes.”\nBitfury, which launched in 2011 as a bitcoin mining operation, has since expanded into a full-service blockchain company. The aggressive rollout of its blockchain analytical tool comes amid escalating regulatory scrutiny of the virtual currency industry around the world. Winklevoss Twins Target Market Manipulators\nBitfury is not the only cryptocurrency group that is enhancing its security measures. The Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, have teamed up with Nasdaq to crack down on fraudulent bitcoin and ether trading on their cryptocurrency exchange, the Gemini Trust Company.\nThe move is part of an effort to stem price manipulation amid volcanic criticism of the erratic price fluctuations of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. (YouTube)\nThe cryptocurrency market’s head-spinning volatility is part of the reason why avowed skeptics like billionaire Warren Buffett have dismissed crypto trading as reckless gambling.\nBuffett’s observations semi-echoed the sentiments of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who mocked the crypto nouveau riche for thinking they are smarter than “the masses” for buying crypto before it became trendy.\nButerin underscored that no one could have foreseen the bitcoin bubble and ensuing riches it bestowed on early adopters. “It’s the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,” he laughed. Hacks And Scams Under Microscope\nAs bitcoin’s profile has skyrocketed amid heavy media coverage, hacks and scams within the digital currency space have also climbed, underscoring the need for structured government regulation and/or better industry-wide deterrence mechanisms.\nOn May 10, 2018, authorities raided the offices of Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as BTCManager has reported.\nWhile the exact reason for the raid is unknown, there are rumors that Upbit is being investigated for illegally moving crypto from the wallets of its clients without their consent. Upbit is also accused of doctoring its accounting books to cover up mass-wrongdoing.\nThis latest news had a dampening trickle-down effect on bitcoin prices, which plunged below $8,300 following a two-week rally. But never fear: The price will rise again soon. Why? Because bitcoin is extremely volatile.

Thanks to solid Bitcoin price increases, the demand for such hardware is accelerating. Two specific firms are both looking to get listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Both Canaan Creative and Zhejiang Ebang Communication hope these listings will push their individual valuation to $1bn respectively. The Lesser Known Chinese Mining Manufacturers\nIn the world of Bitcoin mining hardware, the name Bitmain is well-known. However, other big players have come to market in the past two years. While Canaan Creative and Zhejiang Ebang Communication may not be household names, they shouldn’t be overlooked. Both companies have filed a listing application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. If successful, both companies aim to prop up their respective valuation to $1 billion later this year.\nIt is worth noting Zhejiang Ebang Communication was previously listed on the China National Equities Exchange and Quotations. The firm was delisted in March of 2018. That decision is a direct result of seeking a Hong Kong listing in favor of being traded over-the-counter in China. It seems China is not a favorable market for these particular companies. Hong Kong is a bit more open-minded toward cryptocurrencies at this stage.\nWhether or not this venture will play out for Ebang, remains to be seen. Its listing request has yet to be approved by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Chinese Bitcoin hardware manufacturers show an appetite for additional capital. They all want to keep growing and further solidify its position on the market. Competing with the likes of Bitmain will not be easy, but with enough funding, it may become a legitimate “arms race”. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is Appealing\nCanaan, the vendor of Avalon mining units, has netted a significant revenue throughout 2017. A net revenue of 1 billion yuan is rather significant for this company. It also shows the demand for the company’s dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware is on the rise. A listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will only increase the company’s exposure in this regard.\nIt seems this particular company already has significant support. Local sources report how Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Suisse are all in favor of seeing Canaan valued at $1 billion when it goes live on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This further confirms major companies are paying close attention to the cryptocurrency industry as well. It is unclear if these companies plan to invest in Canaan if the listing gets approved.\nThe big question is how the volatility of cryptocurrencies affects both companies’ chances. More specifically, valuing a company at $1bn when the Bitcoin price has dropped significantly makes little sense. Even so, it is possible both companies will have their requests approved in the coming weeks. More exposure for Bitcoin-related firms will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.\nImage from Shutterstock Chinese Bitcoin Mining Hardware Manufacturers Seek Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing was last modified: May 15th, 2018 by JP Buntinx ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hong kong stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers seek hong kong stock exchange listing jp buntinx", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zhejiang ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:10:19.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b89fc20be18beabc07f927c797d499c661cfe973", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6pl2ppicA2HUsXh8w0.chw-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

A hard fork is usually a fundamental change of the blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology, underpinning a coin. Typically, a hard fork results in two separate coins created, like when Bitcoin Cash forked from core bitcoin in a contentious split over scalability in August (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-bitcoin-cashthe-new-digital-currency-that-surged-122-in-less-than-a-day-2017-08-02), resulting in core and cash versions of the virtual currency. The cash version represented an upgrade to processing power to 8-megabyte units, rather than the one-megabyte block core bitcoin.\nThis hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, however, differs from a conventional hark fork in that no new coins will be created and the older version of BCH will carry no economic value and become obsolete--if all goes well. The upgraded BCH will mean blocksizes will be increased to 32MB, resulting in even faster transactions and lower network fees, according to market participants.\nWhat are altcoins and futures doing?\nOther alternative coins to bitcoin, or alt coins, are showing small losses to begin Tuesday. Ether is down 0.8% at $731.73, Bitcoin Cash is off 1.5% at $1,429.30, Litecoin is off 3% at $146.63 and Ripple's XRPlast traded at 74 cents, down 0.4%.\nFutures have had a quiet start to the trading day.

While the price of Bitcoin dipped to $8,500 Tuesday after nearly going back to $9,000 on Friday, the price of cryptocurrency Zcash surged.\nThe jump came after cryptocurrency bulls Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss gave Zcash a thumbs up Monday, adding that their Bitcoin exchange, Gemini, had gained regulatory approval to list Zcash on its platform. The price of Zcash has surged 47% to $364 since then, adding about $462.8 million to Zcash’s now $1.5 billion market capitalization. Gemini, now the first licensed Zcash exchange, plans to allow Zcash trading starting Tuesday, May 22 at 9:30 a.m. ET.\nIn Gemini’s press release announcing the approvals, the Winklevoss twins focused on Zcash and how it can co-exist alongside Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often billed as highly private, it still broadcasts from where and to where funds are moving—allowing those with basic computer skills to track it. Zcash, on the other hand, was created as a more private cryptocurrency, [2] encrypting those transactions.

In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group. Goldman is not among the new round's investors.\nFive-year-old Circle's first product was designed for buying bitcoin and moving traditional money between individuals by using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nBut in the past year, its other business, facilitating big trades of digital currencies, has surged in volume and revenue.\nThat desk, called Circle Trade, says it has traded about $4 billion in the past month, handling trades from institutions, companies and wealthy individuals, Circle said.\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com\n 16:42 ET (20:42 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital currency startup", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "telis demos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle internet financial ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T05:54:34.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a9f185cfdabb2be3af18fba8ed7671d2f20cdb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_d0HqO5cilpe6KUjq8baG9HnYCyp_ZsOjFwdu3c1sJSvjW4M0P6wOZabZU9a278NxpxIlDav4C8UKifrFoNcKA9cS6V58YKLSgJLEdhTIvQ--", "site_full": "podcast.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "A Porn Star’s Take on Cryptocurrency - Brenna Sparks – Bitcoin.com", "title_full": "A Porn Star’s Take on Cryptocurrency - Brenna Sparks – Bitcoin.com", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "https://podcast.bitcoin.com/images/poster/A-Porn-Stars-Take-on-Cryptocurrency--Brenna-Sparks-1526389034.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a9f185cfdabb2be3af18fba8ed7671d2f20cdb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_d0HqO5cilpe6KUjq8baG9HnYCyp_ZsOjFwdu3c1sJSvjW4M0P6wOZabZU9a278NxpxIlDav4C8UKifrFoNcKA9cS6V58YKLSgJLEdhTIvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shows", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Porn Star’s Take on Cryptocurrency - Brenna Sparks – Bitcoin.com", "text": "About the Episode\nRecently, a Las Vegas strip club was in the news for advertising acceptance of bitcoin.\nStrippers had temporary QR code tattoos on their bodies that clients could scan for sending payment.\nWe wanted to find out more, so we got in touch with adult film star Brenna Sparks, who has worked at the strip club in the past.\nAs you'll find out, the story wasn't entirely accurate.

These moves are quite surprising for bulls since numerous fundamental developments are creating underlying support for the entire cryptocurrency market.\nThe downside volatility moved bitcoin price to $8,200 level last week after peaking around $9,900 a few days ago. BTC coin price currently trades around $8,800.\nThe rest of the cryptocurrency market is in the doldrums.

The consensus change is one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history, and the upgrade also adds the great knowledge of understanding Satoshi’s OP_Codes – which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nAlso Read: Steve Eisman of ‘The Big Short’ Fame: What Value Does Cryptocurrency Actually Add? The Bitcoin Cash Network Has Successfully Upgraded its Block Size to 32MB\nThe wait is over as the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has upgraded its base block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356, and so far the transition has been smooth as the community awaits the next concession of blocks. Miners and other full BCH nodes had already upgraded their clients to the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 and other supported implementations like Bitcoin Unlimited, and XT over the past few week as the community prepared for the change. Among some minor updates, three notable changes have been enforced throughout the network which includes a 32MB block size, an increased default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes. The Bitcoin Cash block size is increasing from 8MB to 32MB. The increase should allow for massive amounts of transaction throughput for years to come.\nThe first and biggest change to the Bitcoin Cash consensus rules is obviously the fourfold block size increase. Raising the block size to 32MB will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent inexpensive transaction fees. Right now the amount of BCH transactions per day has been steadily increasing , and because the base block size has increased by four times its original size, blocks will not fill up for a very long time. The capability of this mechanism has been proven multiple times as there have been many BCH blocks between 2-8MB processed over the course of the past nine months. For instance, just sixteen days after the fork on August 1 the mining pool Viabtc processed an 8MB BCH block which cleared over 37,000 transactions in one fell swoop. Upgrading the Default Data-Carrier-Size to 220 Bytes\nAnother notable Bitcoin Cash network change is the blockchain’s default data-carrier-size being raised from 80-bytes to 220-bytes. This enables a robust OP_Return feature which is a relatively inexpensive way to embed data into the BCH chain. Essentially the OP_Return is a script code that is used to mark transactions as invalid but many cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe the OP_Return feature is meant to record a rich set of data and not just financial transactions. However, back in 2014, BTC developers believed “storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is a bad idea” and recommended users store “non-currency data elsewhere.” OP_Return has been in the Bitcoin codebase since it was launched, and in February 2014 the 80-byte OP_Return was reduced to 40-bytes , but it was later increased merged back to 80 bytes in 2015. Basically, the developers at the time considered this type of blockchain usage as spam and would end up bloating the network. Photo source: Massimo Bartoletti and Livio Pompianu’s An Analysis of Bitcoin OP_Return Metadata\nHowever, even as developers warned that the use of OP_Return was a ‘bad idea,’ individuals and organizations continued to use it to embed arbitrary data. Two organizations, specifically Omni layer, and Counterparty, showed that using OP_Return for arbitrary data could be innovative towards building meta-protocols over a secure blockchain — although when blocks are full and the network is congested these types of layer systems find the blockchain’s network fees unsustainable. The BCH chain upgrading to 32MB and increasing the default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes will allow all kinds of innovations, like added creativity in applications such as Memo, Counterparty Cash, Blockpress, and many other platforms. This Upgrade Will Help the Cryptocurrency Community Learn to Understand the Original Satoshi OP_Codes Programming languages like Bitcoin’s Script and Forth are considered the ‘hackers programming languages.’\nLast but not least is the re-enabling of disabled Satoshi OP_Codes — which are essentially codes that perform specific operations using an internal stack language called Script . Many people consider Script to be extremely similar to the programming language Forth — another stack-based language and software environment. In the original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin client, the creator added OP_Codes to the software which can perform operations like simple math and string handling processes. Most of the original OP_Codes were disabled in earlier clients and many people believe this language could bring new functionalities to the Bitcoin Cash network.\nThe OP_Codes implemented on the BCH network will improve our understanding of these codes Satoshi originally added. If all goes well with gaining knowledge from these codes then developers can enhance binary operations and contracts using the OP_Datasigverify code, and possibly OP_Group in the future. Further BCH proponents believe all of the OP_Codes will bring forth many innovative features such as multi-signature operations, colored coins or representative tokens, smart contract compilers, and 0-confirmation sending techniques. A list of OP_Codes Satoshi Nakamoto created long ago. Each has its own operation or function. Not the Last Upgrade\nToday’s upgrade is the first step towards many of these innovations and visions BCH proponents have been talking about for months. And there’s a bunch of other developments being discussed, such as double spend notifications — which notify nodes when a double spend takes place and a new Proof-of-Work (PoW) target called Bobtail . Additionally, programmers are looking into the Graphene protocol and other concepts that could add a rich feature set to the BCH chain. Today’s 32MB upgrade was a successful fork for the BCH community, and very likely there will be many more other upgrades in the future.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash upgrade?

Coinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading.\nHigh-frequency trading, or HFT firms, use computers to buy and sell stocks, futures and other assets in the blink of eye. They accounted for 55% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market last year, according to research firm Tabb Group LLC, but they have only recently begun to dabble in cryptocurrencies.\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times. Coinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location. HFT firms often put their servers next to the computers that power exchanges like Nasdaq Inc. or the New York Stock Exchange, to minimize the split-second delays associated with transmitting data back and forth between the trading firm and the exchange.\nAccording to Coinbase, the plan will benefit customers by reducing bid-ask spreads—the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset. Advocates of HFT say the growth of high-speed trading in the stock market over the past two decades helped drive bid-ask spreads down to just one penny in many big stocks. But Coinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nRead an extended version of this article at WSJ.com.\nPopular on WSJ.com Tesla CEO Musk Says Company Is ‘Flattening Management Structure’ in Reorganization At Mueller Probe’s First Trial, Expect More Blunt Lectures From the Bench", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-mueller-probes-first-trial-expect-more-blunt-lectures-from-the-bench-1526385601?mod=trending_now_4", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-ceo-musk-says-company-is-flattening-management-structure-inreorganization-1526308678?mod=trending_now_1", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-bitcoin-exchange-welcomes-high-speed-traders-1526385600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tabb group llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:33:54.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51b37d9dcb52d4ee1399aaf0d46e5a5c8d22ba03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_tehq4EG1FsU2IVxvyw.j7d2chxxAJp4h5EWdsVRAgUPe9BE.uVPpkmUrZ4oYP2Z0PMnKhrEhBvYZdKo1t6Z.P7MV27LCpimCt7ztFhhpae6KLWvvNgIYEmr.MKDMNdXo-", "site_full": "www.kitco.com", "site": "kitco.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert—Bulls Work To Stabilize Market | Kitco News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert—Bulls Work To Stabilize Market | Kitco News", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.242, "main_image": "http://www.kitco.com/images/kitco-news-social-share-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7841, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51b37d9dcb52d4ee1399aaf0d46e5a5c8d22ba03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_tehq4EG1FsU2IVxvyw.j7d2chxxAJp4h5EWdsVRAgUPe9BE.uVPpkmUrZ4oYP2Z0PMnKhrEhBvYZdKo1t6Z.P7MV27LCpimCt7ztFhhpae6KLWvvNgIYEmr.MKDMNdXo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Http", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert—Bulls Work To Stabilize Market | Kitco News", "text": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert—Bulls Work To Stabilize Market Jim Wyckoff Tuesday May 15, 2018 09:23\nKitco News\nShare this article:\nEditor's Note: Welcome to Kitco's new Bitcoin Daily Technical Alert.

Really think about it for a second, deeply. If the bitcoin price reached $17,000, would you calmly cash out, or hope to ride the bull market to even greater heights?\nWherever you land on the spectrum of bitcoin belief , the cryptocurrency market is obviously volatile. Prices bounce and dip in every direction. These gyrations make the strange digital asset endlessly fascinating – and maddeningly risky. Introducing financial derivatives into the bitcoin ecosystem adds another layer of complexity, but stakeholders have portrayed the products as stabilizing forces. Earlier this month, even the San Francisco Federal Reserve suggested that cryptocurrency derivatives tamed the market: \"The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the [bitcoin] price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.\"\nAs cryptocurrency investors chase their next high, new-fangled products have quickly been developed to meet the demands of the ravenous crowd. This week, LedgerX introduced \"LedgerSavings,\" which the company described as \"an innovative product that uses an underlying call overwrite strategy. The offering targets a 16% per annum yield with a potential 2x exit at maturity in the event BTC doubles from current spot prices.\" Via savings.ledgerX.com Source Descriptions like that are apt to make a customer's eyes glaze over … but the highlighted \"16% return / 2x Exit\" might tempt some into the purported investment opportunity. The premise is this: If a customer owns bitcoin and wants to \"earn a return,\" then they can bet that the price of bitcoin will not double before a certain date.\nOther people take the opposite side of the bet and they pay a small fee for a chance to buy bitcoin at a fixed price (approximately double the current price). Stay with me here.\nIf bitcoin increases in price by 2x (or more), then the original customer receives a cash payout roughly equivalent to double the current price. In this instance, the other bettor receives the bitcoin (which could be worth more than double the current price).\nIf bitcoin does not double in price, then the original customer receives the fee paid by the bullish gamblers (what LedgerX calls \"interest\") and the original customer receives their bitcoin deposit back at the end of the contract . The bullish options buyers go home empty-handed. Of course, LedgerX takes its cut regardless of what happens.\nNote: The underlying price of bitcoin will be changing throughout the duration of the contract as well, so investors must remember that they are also exposed to the risk of holding bitcoin for a set timeframe.\nThere is nothing objectionable about the financial product itself. Covered call options are popular in the stock market and many people use them to great effect. However, the idea that people are \"earning interest\" on their bitcoin holdings is fundamentally flawed for a few reasons:\n1. The \"interest\" is distributed in USD, not bitcoin.\nThis is not a small sticking point. This \"interest\" transaction occurs entirely in dollars, not BTC. Don't get confused. LedgerX isn't minting new bitcoins out of thin air, and the \"interest\" comes from somebody (the other bettors).\n2. The \"interest\" that people earn is based on an accepted risk.\nAlthough LedgerX is promising a 2x payout if bitcoin rises to twice its current value (or more), what they paint over is that bitcoin depositors would miss out on further potential gains if the price exceeds twice the current valuation. It's implied, but not explicit – people considering this financial product must understand what signing up for these ostensibly interest-bearing products really means.\nIt's worth noting that at high prices, the bet seems less risky. In more concrete terms, at a price of $8,500 per bitcoin, the 2x bet might be more palatable. The increase from $8,500 to $17,000 is much greater in absolute terms – and probably less likely to happen – than an increase at lower prices, say from $1,000 to $2,000. At these lower prices, volatile markets could sooner result in dissatisfaction.\n3. This is not a \"savings\" account .\nThe language LedgerX uses to describe this financial product might make it sound nearly riskless, as though a person were holding dollars in an FDIC-insured savings account at a bank. Its name even includes the word \"savings.\" To be 100 percent clear, this is not a savings account . The price of bitcoin could double, or more. Sure, a customer would receive that 2x payout in USD, but the gain itself is capped. It's critical to understand that this is a \"savings product,\" not a savings account .\nTakeaway\nAltogether, LedgerX inappropriately conveys a limited risk by suggesting that people can earn \"interest\" through LedgerSavings \"without having to know anything about derivatives.\" There is nothing wrong with the bitcoin-linked financial product. However, customers should be aware of the upside risk of this new instrument and the risk of tying up crypto-capital for long periods of time.

Understanding The Ban\nWhile many see bans on crypto mining as a hindrance to entrepreneurship and the crypto space, in actuality, it’s an effort to protect and enhance cities, states, and countries’ natural, historic, cultural, and electrical resources.\nBack in March, a moratorium was enacted in Plattsburgh, New York, the first major U.S. city to pause any and all mining operations due to an operation that had nearly drained the city of its electrical resources, at the expense of the residents who were the ones paying for it. Plattsburgh’s ban stated that it would issue a penalty of up to $1,000/day on any firm, person, corporation, or other entity that established or ran a commercial cryptocurrency mining operation once the ban went into effect. Why Is Russia a ‘Hot Spot’ For Mining?\nFor its part, Russia will soon become home to one of the largest legal mining operations in the world, located in Siberia. Earlier this year, the Bank of Russia, Russia’s central bank, offered to allow the mining of cryptocurrencies, but proposed that miners sell their coins outside the country. The first deputy governor of the bank emphasized the need to take a “taxation point of view” and consider how it can be controlled and reported. However, selling cryptocurrencies outside the country doesn’t remove the requirement that miners file and pay their taxes.\nOne company, Minery , recently announced that it intends to establish five mining complexes with a total capacity of 55 megawatts on a 59,000 square foot site within the Irkutsk region. It has partnered with Bratsk Electric Grid Company JSC, a regional power supplier.\nThe company is considered a ‘turnkey’ mining solution, providing all necessary hardware, installation, and configuration. In the event of any service needs or breakdowns, the company makes the necessary repairs on the spot. This type of operation comes in handy when engaging in contracts with cloud mining providers, mining pools, or third-party hosting platforms. Operating at the lowest electricity rates, it’s still considered legal in light of the policies proposed by the Russian Federation and Bank.\nRussia’s energy resources and climate make for some of the best conditions for crypto mining. Consequently, more than 1.5 million Russians have started to engage in solo mining (home mining). Doing so comes with great risks, as this method of operation tends to cause an annoyance and nuisance to those around, not to mention safety hazards. Oftentimes, these operations are operating illegally, and rather than providing value to communities, they are draining them.\nFor example, many illegal mining farms are closed and those behind them are arrested. Why? Well, you have (1) individuals stealing electricity that belongs to a designated area and those who pay money for it, (2) the land and premises being used for other purposes at the expense of area residents, and (3) equipment being smuggled across state lines and international borders.\n“Having been mining since 2016, we have encountered restrictions [on] home mining, and came up with a solution in terms of scalability and legal operations,” says Ilya Bruman, co-founder and CEO of Minery. “The idea is to build a comprehensive infrastructure, providing highly-efficient, powerful, and a stable electricity supply for our investors, ensuring smooth operation of their mining businesses.”\nUnder Russia’s proposed regulations, the majority of such businesses will become illegal. Minery is not among them. Staying Within The Volts\nThe biggest issue with many of the mining operations that are later deemed illegal is that the electricity being used is done so without authorization—often draining cities and towns of this highly used and profitable resource. It’s even gone digital, in the case of cryptojacking malware which attacks computers and servers, draining their CPU power and resources .\nMinery’s mining complexes are located in several cities in the Irkutsk (Siberia) region – Bratsk, Irkutsk and Ust-Ilimsk. The local climate conditions – the average annual temperature is 28.4° Fahrenheit, or -2° Celsius – are optimal for miners’ heat transfer and cooling systems, which reduces hosting expenses. The project relies on renewable electricity from high-pressure hydroelectric power plants – the Bratsk, Irkutsk, and Ust-Ilimsk Hydroelectric Power Stations. The plants are located on the Angara River, which drains Lake Baikal – the largest freshwater lake in the world.\nTo ensure optimal working conditions, any mining operation should reduce energy costs while maintaining the equipment itself. “This goal is achieved by placing mining facilities near the sources of the cheapest and most eco-friendly electricity – hydroelectric power stations,” says Alexei Paikin, co-founder and managing director of Minery. “This approach minimizes the cost of delivering electricity to the point of consumption.” About The Author drossow\nI am a criminal defense/internet attorney, writer and law professor in Dayton, Ohio.

Early Days For Bitcoin\nThe results reaffirm what many already know to be true about the current state of cryptocurrency: consumer adoption is still far out, with financial institutions due to adopt the technology long before the average citizen.\nLast month, Bitcoinist reported on how a Thomson Reuters survey revealed some more surprising numbers in this respect: 20% of finance firms were planning a crypto market entry, with over 50 of the 400 participants planning to complete theirs before the end of 2018.\nDespite a push to formalize markets from multiple jurisdictions this year, and those such as Japan actively encouraging consumer uptake, most are still distanced from cryptocurrency.\nTo tip the balance for US consumers, it would appear Bitcoin, as the most popular cryptocurrency owned by survey respondents, must overcome barriers involving “bubble” fears, ease-of-use and fees.\n“While plenty of crypto proponents might disagree, 16.12% are waiting for what they think is a bubble to burst. A further 11.40% find it too difficult to use, and 5.75% think that there are too many fees involved,” Finder reveals.\nWhat do you think about the Finder survey results?

Bitcoin ‘The Real Innovation’\nSpeaking during a panel at Consensus 2018 , which has since become infamous as a frank discussion of Bitcoin vs. Blockchain, Song made the bet with Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin.\n“I don’t really see much of this stuff gaining much traction,” he said referencing blockchain solutions for global enterprise arguing Bitcoin is “the real innovation here.”\n“I’ll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you’re wrong,” Lubin retorted, the pair adding the exact nature of the bet will be confirmed on social media.\nThe exchange had come about as an offshoot of a panel involving Song, Lubin and Amber Baldet, former blockchain program lead at JPMorgan, who had just presented her new blockchain project Clovyr.\nAsked what he thought of it, Song “shocked” the audience by saying:\nI don’t see anything other than buzzwords. JPMorgan’s Lack Of ‘Substance’\n“What I said wasn’t anything special,” he subsequently summarized on Twitter.\nI verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn’t get anything of substance from the presentation.\nThe mood appeared friendly, Song also thanking for Baldet and Lubin for being “good sports” but nonetheless underscoring the frustration shared by many technical experts in the cryptocurrency industry about blockchain – that commercial parties can present the technology and rely on a lack of understanding to give their solutions free passage.\n“Giving voice to something that you know is true often results in shock and laughter. That’s what I saw,” Song continued.\nThe entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist. 5/ What I said wasn't anything special. I verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn't get anything of substance from the presentation.\n— Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) May 15, 2018\nReacting to the episode, Saifedean Ammous, author of ‘The Bitcoin Standard,’ agreed with Song, using Lubin’s sarcastic forecast that “Bitcoin 1.0” will be the sole innovation by 2023 in his favor.\n“BITCOIN 1.0: STILL the only game in town,” he tweeted.\nWhat do you think about Jimmy Song’s comments and wager with Joseph Lubin?

Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.\nThe rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC. Daily chart\nOn Monday, BTC created a doji - a candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990, the doji signals indecision among the bears (or bearish exhaustion). So, the immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized.\nA close today (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $8,837 would signal bullish doji reversal and upside break of the trading range. Meanwhile, a close below the 50-day MA of $8,287 would confirm downside break of the trading range and bearish doji continuation pattern, i.e. sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has resumed.\nThat said, the odds of the bullish breakout (or bull doji reversal) still appear low, as the bulls face an uphill task as seen in the chart below. 4-hour chart\nOn the above chart, the falling trendline resistance is seen around $8,810 and is immediately followed by hurdle at $8,910 (expanding channel resistance).\nWith major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) trending south (bearish), BTC bulls will likely struggle to cut through resistance at $8,900 in a convincing manner.\nNote, the bears are about to score another brownie point by pushing the 50-candle MA below the 200-candle MA (bearish crossover).\nThe 5-day MA and the 10-day MA (seen in the daily chart) are also biased bearish. View\nAnother rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.\nThat said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).\nOn the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.\nChalk arrows image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:38:06.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a565c2b62f37859753d8096c747df4f4189253d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6qcJW.Wl73ad372ZcvTWxAbiE7.i3gNKmL3ZsrpxNi64GCLsCSgHxjpYz8p5jJKyGRT2h6JrxlqAt.uCImogXfiiGQHuTaT.Skuud62te8ek-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’ - Worldnews.com", "title_full": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’ - Worldnews.com", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1oX9L6e6_Q/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a565c2b62f37859753d8096c747df4f4189253d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6qcJW.Wl73ad372ZcvTWxAbiE7.i3gNKmL3ZsrpxNi64GCLsCSgHxjpYz8p5jJKyGRT2h6JrxlqAt.uCImogXfiiGQHuTaT.Skuud62te8ek-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’ - Worldnews.com", "text": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’ Posted , 2018-05-15 developed with YouTube Dubai-based exchange BitOasis has suspended UAE Dirham/BTC trading, citing issues with the bank servicing the exchange itself.

The location in southern Dubai, is kind of a enclave of tall building and it\\'s extremely modern. It\\'s a good area to stay, though next trip to Dubai, I would probably choose to stay more in the downtown area. The apartment was very luxurious, and extremely spacious and comfortable. It\\'s a huge apartment complex that includes just about everything you could need all within the compound - supermarket, pharmacy, and many other things. Overall, a very nice apartment in Dubai - and it was a very good deal renting it short term in comparison to paying for a hotel room. Thank you for watching!

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania®, a “city” where children can roleplay various careers. To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you’d like to try something a little different and don’t mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren’t staying there. You can’t finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Bloomberg News reported earlier Tuesday that Canaan had filed for an IPO that could raise about $1 billion. The filing didn’t say how much Canaan will seek.\nCanaan aims to start trading as soon as July, a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The company, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, had revenue of 1.3 billion yuan ($205 million) last year. Net income surged more than sixfold to 361 million yuan, according to Tuesday’s filing.\nA listing of Canaan would be the first Hong Kong IPO from the cryptocurrency industry. The company has about 15 percent of the global market for bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, trailing Chinese rival Bitmain, according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\nCanaan, founded in 2013, sells computer equipment under the “Avalon” brand with fast, customized chips that win digital coins by solving complex math problems. The company’s hardware often ends up in remote locales housing large mining pools that depend on cheap electricity, Co-Chairman Jianping Kong said in an April interview.\nThe company also announced last year it was developing dedicated chips for use in artificial intelligence applications.\nNo final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Kong declined to comment on details of the IPO plans.\nCanaan was preparing last year to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market known as the New Third Board, before opting to pursue a Hong Kong IPO.\nIn 2016, electrical equipment manufacturer Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric Plc sought to acquire Canaan, according to filings at the time. “Great uncertainties” surrounding China’s securities environment and regulatory policies torpedoed the deal, Shandong Luyitong said in a statement at the time.\nThe ASIC-based blockchain hardware market in China grew to 7.3 billion yuan last year from 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan said in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan forecasts that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Crystal Tse in Hong Kong at ctse44@bloomberg.net, Blake Schmidt in Hong Kong at bschmidt16@bloomberg.net.\nTo contact the editors Ben Scent at bscent@bloomberg.net, Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Marcus Wright\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin mining equipment maker canaan files", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canaan inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deutsche bank ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit suisse group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmb international capital ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:51:36.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c54dc9fc60b605971551a42e08afa6e48e08d6ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R.DO_73nHilGgV7DXseSEo6Bq.SsHYBVdlB9WcIXSivhYsQo0DW1lrC9H2ZeJZmBHuv.pMGF4BGJP4RGKM_N8s2", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Dip as Opinion Leader Thoughts Diverge – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Dip as Opinion Leader Thoughts Diverge – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c54dc9fc60b605971551a42e08afa6e48e08d6ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R.DO_73nHilGgV7DXseSEo6Bq.SsHYBVdlB9WcIXSivhYsQo0DW1lrC9H2ZeJZmBHuv.pMGF4BGJP4RGKM_N8s2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Dip as Opinion Leader Thoughts Diverge – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily Bitcoin Today: Prices Dip as Opinion Leader Thoughts Diverge Bitcoin prices traded lower Tuesday as thought leaders shared differing opinions and the much-anticipated Consensus conference in New York failed ...

The Winklevoss twin’s trading platform will begin accepting deposits in Zcash on May 19. Gemini, a regulated exchange that serves customers in 48 U.S. states, will also receive approvals for Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, though the exchange has not yet announced plans to do so\nAt present, only Bitcoin and Ethereum are available on Gemini, therefore these listings will open up both Gemini and the currencies in question to a whole new world of trading potential.\nThe inclusion of Zcash to the platform has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services. This makes it the first regulated exchange that will allow the trading of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. According to a report in Forbes , the first day that Gemini users will be able to buy and sell Zcash will be May 22.\nOne of the brothers behind the Gemini exchange, Cameron Winklevoss, wrote in a letter that the addition of new digital assets was a close collaboration with the NYDFS, saying:\n“Our approval makes Gemini the first licensed Zcash exchange in the world. It also makes the NYDFS the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise Zcash.”\nWinklevoss also acknowledged Zcash’s privacy features in the letter. He states that anonymity was one of the reasons for the coin’s appeal. To achieve such levels of privacy, Zcash uses a combination of shielded and unshielded addresses. To begin with, the Gemini exchange will accept deposits from both forms of addresses but only unshielded withdrawals will be allowed. By doing so, the offering will remain compliant with regulations. Gemini also has customers in Washington, D.C.l Puerto Rico, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and the U.K. NYSDFS is the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise Zcash. NYDFS executive Maria Vullo said “This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,”\nThis will make Gemini the first licensed Zcash exchange in the world and will give the currency a real boost in terms of trading volume. The Zcash price surged following the NYDFS announcement, reaching as high as $345 on cryptocurrency trading platform Bitfinex.

Through a simplified version, a user chooses the implied rate they want to earn with the new savings account and the number of bitcoins they are hoping to earn the yield on. They then submit this to the LedgerX matching engine that is powering their existing bitcoin options product.\nAt its most basic, the idea is to make it easier for investors to know when they can potentially make a premium on the sale of their asset. The LedgerX Savings account also comes with two CFTC licenses: a derivatives clearing organisation (DCO) license and a swap execution facility (SEF) license. According to Forbes, this ‘signals an increasing level of sophistication being offered to bitcoin users.’\nDesigned based on the use patterns of LedgerX’s existing customers the platform expects to see high volumes on the product. Similar to the way a normal savings account works, though, it may have more appeal to those who prefer to hodl their bitcoin rather than sell. The whole point, after all, is to earn interest off the digital currency that has been deposited into the accounts. So much so, that according to LedgerX, the savings interface will be ‘skewed to the long bitcoin holders.’\nYet, while the volatility of the cryptocurrency is what makes the product work, the unpredictability of the coin may not be an attractive option for everyone. According to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin is currently trading at $8,589, representing a 2.25 percent decline in the past 24 hours. Notably, though, this time last year bitcoin was trading at $1,724. Those are attractive gains for hodlers. Featured image from Shutterstock.

In recent months they have launched Circle Invest, purchased Poloniex, and redesigned Circle Pay. Now they are launching not only USD Coin, but have announced Centre, what they hope will become a group of companies designed to facilitate the creation of other fiat backed stable coins. Bitmain joined them on stage to announce that they are a part of that group. The group’s main purpose will be to impose a set of standards that ensure transparency, stability and ensure the coins are truly backed by their fiat counterpart.\nAccording to Circle, there will be three primary use cases of USD Coin and any other fiat coins that come out of Centre. The first will be to act as an easily accessible hedge for crypto traders. This isn’t unheard of. Uphold has been offering ways for users to hold their crypto in a variety of different currencies and commodities. But those aren’t actual coins you can take out of their system. USD Coin will be ERC20 compatible, meaning it should be easily added to most exchanges and in theory should work with any ERC20 compatible wallet.\nThe second use case is as a trading pair. Most exchanges use Bitcoin as their main trading pair, allowing users to trade other coins against Bitcoin’s value. But with the USD Coin, users should be able to trade any coin against the value of the US dollar.\nThe last use case is a bit more interesting. As an ERC20 compatible coin, USD Coin can be used in Ethereum Smart Contracts. So rather than denominating them in a volatile coin like Ether, their costs can be controlled using the fiat backed stable coin.\nThis potentially has massive implications for DApps. Decentralized exchanges will be much easier to use with a stable fiat coin. Imagine a future with an autotomized uber utilizing self-driving cars. Would either the consumer or the company want payment to be in Ether? Prices would have to fluctuate constantly. USD Coin could give such a system stability. And, since it is a global platform, it could be used in nations all across the world. The same company might use JPY Coin in Japan but exchanging the two would be trivial for travelers from the United States.\nIn what would have been a big deal on a normal day but was tucked into the end of the speech today, Bitmain and Circle have announced a partnership. That partnership includes Bitmain leading a $110 million strategic investment round into Circle. According to CoinDesk , that puts the company’s evaluation at over $4 billion.\nThe minting and burning of USD Coin, as well as any future fiat backed coin will be done by Centre. The user will join Circle or another Centre approved partner, connect their bank account and deposit fiat. Then the corresponding USD Coins will be minted. When the user wants to cash back out, Circle or another Centre approved partner will deposit the fiat back into his or her account and the corresponding USD Coins will be burned.\nCircle says Centre’s standards will be open source. Its governance model will allow any exchange, bank or financial institution to join.\nIn a talk after their announcement with CoinDesk Live , they asked if Circle was concerned about scalability. They didn’t provide a solution but did say that was an issue Centre would be addressing, along with governance, standard and keeping the price stable.\nUSD Coin has not yet launched, but Circle expects it to launch in a few months. They asserted that Asia is the center of the cryptocurrency world and therefore, they think other stable coins will be a very important part of the project.\nThe reaction on Twitter was mixed. Many users seemed to see the use case of USD Coin over competitors such as Tether and other stable coins. Others, many of whom are already hostile to the Goldman Sachs backed Circle, decried what they saw as a centralized governance model.\nYou can read more on USD Coin and Centre on Circle’s FAQ and the Centre’s whitepaper .

The document updates the anti-money laundering legislation of the European Union to address, among other issues, “the risks linked to virtual currencies.” The new rules aim to reduce anonymity for both users and transactions with requirements for know-your-customer procedures that crypto platforms will have to implement. Meanwhile, a high-ranking ECB official has called for segregating the crypto business from traditional finances.\nAlso read: Europe Introduces Customer Verification on Cryptocurrency Exchanges Authorities to Monitor the Use of Cryptocurrencies\n“Strengthening EU rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing” has been declared as the main purpose for the changes adopted as part of an “action plan” launched after the terrorist attacks in Europe in 2016. The new directive sets out to “close down criminal finance without hindering the normal functioning of the payment systems,” according to the Council’s press service. The amendments to EU Directive 2015/849 of the European Parliament and the Council of May 20, 2015, were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, without discussion. The move follows an agreement with the European Parliament form December 2017. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. According to the texts, providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the identities of their owners.\nThe authors acknowledge that the measures in the document do not entirely address the issue of anonymity. These measures should be detailed by member-states which will have 18 months to transpose the provisions of the directive into their national regulatory frameworks. Once that happens, crypto exchanges across the Union will be obliged to comply with stricter anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) guidelines, including by introducing full customer verification on their platforms.\nSome companies have already taken steps in that direction. Localbitcoins , the popular Helsinki-based peer-to-peer exchange, has recently updated its Terms of Service . It admitted that the changes had been introduced mainly due to EU regulations . They highlight identification requirements and warn users that in some situations, such as trading over certain volume limits, or in cases of account hacking/recovery and fraud investigations, they will be required to submit identification documents. The new terms will be enforced as early as this month. Virtual Currencies Defined\nThe EU Council states that “virtual currencies should not to be confused with electronic money.” Its directive points out that although cryptos can be used as a means of payment, they could also serve other purposes and find broader applications such as means of exchange, investment, and store-of-value.\nA definition of “virtual currencies” has been provided, in which they have been referred to as “digital representation of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority.” The directive also notes that cryptocurrencies are not attached to a legally established currency and do not have the legal status of fiat money, but are accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange. Cryptocurrencies can be transferred, stored and traded electronically, the text reads.\nThe European institution has identified custodian wallet providers as “entities safeguarding private cryptographic keys on behalf of their customers in order to hold, store and transfer virtual currencies.” According to the legal document, national authorities should ensure that they, along with the providers of crypto exchange services, are registered or licensed.\nThe directive also introduces changes regarding anonymous prepaid bank cards to “deny terrorists this means of financing.” The threshold for mandatory identification of their holders has been lowered to EUR 150. Identity verification will also be required in cases of remote payment transactions exceeding EUR 50. ECB Official Wants to “Ring-Fence” Crypto Business\nWhile Brussels is moving to strengthen rules governing crypto transactions, Frankfurt is suggesting that the entire crypto business should be segregated from traditional finances. According to a report by Reuters , a high-ranking representative of the European Central Bank has stated that banks should separate any activities related to virtual currencies (VCs) from their other operations and even back them with capital to reduce the risk. The official also called for regulating issuers of cryptos and tokens, exchanges, and any bank or clearing house dealing in them.\n“Due to the high volatility of virtual currencies, it might seem appropriate to require any VC trading to be backed by adequate levels of capital and segregated from other trading and investment activities,” Yves Mersch, member of the ECB board, said at a conference in Turkey this Monday. He added that the crypto market was too small to endanger financial stability but cautioned this could change. Mersch emphasized that “There’s a need to examine whether any VC activity carried out by financial market infrastructures should have to be ring-fenced.”\nWhat do you think about the new rules that will soon govern crypto interactions in the EU?

After announcing Signal on May 10, 2018, an integrated messaging service dedicated to “pure,” relevant and verified information, the outfit is seeking to tackle the often copious spam and sundry noise encountered in the cryptosphere. A Broadcasting Service for Projects\nPlatforms like Telegram, Slack, and other social media portals are often littered with misinformation, confusing both new entrants as well as established enthusiasts. Often a breeding ground for scam offers too, as the top cryptocurrency portfolio tracker with over four millions users globally, Blockfolio is seeking to present a new, clean and more professional platform in Signal to serve communication needs within the cryptosphere better. Sponsored Links ( Source : Blockfolio) Still, in beta phase, the new platform already has a number of projects signed and involved in the rollout. Signal will allow blockchain projects to speak directly to users, eliminating fake news and other irrelevant input, a move that will both professionalize and grow the token community. Spurred in part by the meteoric rise of Bitcoin as well as the overall entrenchment of cryptocurrencies, Signal, is designed to eliminate the problem of misinformation and sheer overload, with subsequent confusion within the cryptosphere.\nThe Signal hybrid app is Integrated with the Blockfolio app, and available on both the App Store and Google Play. Some twenty reputable projects comprise the first batch of participants, including Dash, 0x, Civic, Icon, Decred, Quantstamp, the Request and Kyber Network, TenX, Zilliqa, aelf, IOSToken, Siacoin, DigixDAO, Zcoin, UTRUST, Enigma, Mithril, Nexus and GameCredits.\nAs chat rooms and other platforms continue to bandy about misinformation and unverified data, industry players fear that these sources can lead to misfortune. Blockfolio Signal is now accessible to all users! Connect with your token teams now and take advantage of this awesome new communication channel! https://t.co/wWatBJON26\n— Blockfolio (@BlockfolioApp) May 12, 2018\nSignal is a scalable, authentic and transparent means of communication between project teams and the user base. Now registered token teams partaking in the Signal beta phase can broadcast direct updates and other valuable information via the Blockfolio network. With personalized feed and push notifications, users can monitor the coins that constitute their portfolio. Blockfolio CEO Ed Moncada said:\n“With Signal, we mainline important team information directly to users. Signals come straight from the token team leadership, free of the noise and toxicity that we so often see in the current communication channels used by the global crypto community. Top token teams have recognized a need for this solution.” A Platform Welcomed by Developers\nThe CEO of Kyber Network, Loi Luu, noted that “Blockfolio’s Signal provides an excellent platform for users to keep up-to-date with projects with critical information directly from the project teams.” He accentuated that Kyber Network has already benefited significantly from Signal, as it provides a direct and prompt link to their user base.\nThe Civic CEO Vinny Lingham confirmed, saying “We’re happy to be part of the first batch of teams using Signal and our community has had a very positive response to the first Civic Signal we sent out. With Signal, the Blockfolio team is delivering on its new mission of tackling the issues around misinformation and communication in crypto. With millions of global users, and CEO Ed Moncada, as a founding board member of top cryptocurrency Dash, providing firsthand experience and a deep understanding of the needs of the token teams, Signal [should become] a key communications channel for token teams.”Blockfolio has also announced its intention to raise $3 million in capital to develop as demand rises, looking at outfits like Playground Ventures, DCM and L2 Ventures. Their quest exposes them to a diverse array of investors via these VC outfits, as interested parties from South Korea, Japan, and China, Europe and America are all able to contribute. The funds raised will also connect the more than 3,000 token teams that have joined in the Signal project.

By root / May 15, 2018\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price has bounced off the area of interest previously highlighted to signal that the selloff would resume. Applying the Fibonacci extension tool shows how low bitcoin could go from here. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with the oscillators reflecting more bearish pressure.\nBitcoin price is bouncing off the downtrend line and looks ready to resume the drop to new lows.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. The 200 SMA also lines up with the downtrend line to add to its strength as a ceiling.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential upward crossover or return in bullish momentum. The 100 SMA might also be able to hold as dynamic support. If so, a move past the trend line, swing high and $9000 mark could confirm that an uptrend is taking place.\nRSI is turning lower to show that sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic has also made its way out of the overbought zone and is heading south, so bitcoin price might follow suit. The 38.2% extension is at the $8400 area and the 50% level is close to the swing low. Stronger selling momentum could take bitcoin price to the 78.6% extension at $7913 or the full extension at $7650.\nBTC/USD 1-hour Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price seems to be off to another shaky start for the week as another failed attempt at breaking past $9,000 has drawn more selling pressure and spooked some bulls. However, positive updates in the industry are still popping up and could ultimately allow the climb to resume.\nAt the moment, what’s keeping investors on edge is the possibility that Mt. Gox will short another set of bitcoin to pay off its creditors. An estimated 8,000 coins are still up for selling, so this could have a huge weight on price.

But when I respond that while bitcoin might be newsworthy, the really important narrative concerns the blockchain technology that underpins it, their eyes glaze over and they start looking for the nearest exit as they conclude that they are in the grip of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner .\nAnd, in a sense, the objective is. Blockchain technology is indeed important, but it seems largely incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, even though the web teems with attempts to explain it . This is partly because cryptography lies at its core, and since crypto involves complex maths it was thus lies beyond the ken of most people. But if one is prepared to take the maths as given, then actually the basic idea is simple. As Don and Alex Tapscott put it in their volume, Blockchain Revolution , a blockchain” is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not only financial transactions but virtually everything of value “.\nUntil recently, the banking establishment was unremittingly hostile to cryptocurrencies. Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, for example, famously described bitcoin as a “fraud” . But recently, the wind seems to have changed. Last December, two big exchanges- the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets- launched bitcoin futures trading operations. This week Goldman Sachs announced that it would follow suit and is looking into the direct trading of bitcoin. And now- according to Wednesday’s Financial Times – even the New York Stock Exchange is” setting up an online platform for buying and holding bitcoin “.\nSo what’s going on? To interpret it you need to understand that the cryptocurrency story has two interwoven strands: human avarice on the one hand and utopian idealism on the other. It’s no accident that bitcoin emerged just after the 2008 banking crisis as people realised that we had been taken for an epic ride by the financial services industry. In a world where nobody- even the biggest banks- could be trusted, an unknown genius going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper arguing that cryptography could be harnessed to enable trustworthy transactions without having to rely on fallible or corrupted human institutions. A new digital currency- bitcoin- was the working example he proposed. And underpinning it was the cryptographic tool- the blockchain- which ensured that all transactions in the new currency could be validated without requiring an institution to guarantee or underwrite them.\nBecause the total number of bitcoins that can exist is limited by the design of the system to 21 m, the currency was rapidly perceived as an asset or a store of value- like gold. Accordingly greed kicked in, triggering waves of speculative mania that are still continuing. And it is this speculative wave that Goldman Sachs and co now- belatedly- wish to surf.\nNo surprise there, then. But implicit in the blockchain notion is an endearing strain of technocratic utopianism, a hope that technology can overcome some aspects of human frailty and corruption. The key to that lies in the latter half of the Tapscott definition quoted earlier- the idea that a blockchain can record” not only financial transactions but virtually everything of value” in a ledger that cannot be falsified.\nThis is a really big idea, because well-governed societies depend on maintaining certain kinds of documentation- birth and death credentials, title deeds, wills and so on- in ledgers that are both public and secure. In industrialised societies we have achieved this by having trustworthy organizations( registrars, solicitors, local authorities, etc ), which have legal responsibilities and democratic oversight. But other societies are not so fortunate. In developing or authoritarian countries, for example, registries of land titles are critically vulnerable to tampering by corrupted officials. Use a blockchain to hold such titles could offer a style of ensuring that credible records endure, which is why countries such as the Republic of Georgia are beginning to do it .\nNone of this is easy to do, and there are lots of practical difficulties ahead. But in the greed and cynicism surrounding bitcoin and its peers, we shouldn’t lose sight of the great potential of blockchain technology. Many years ago, an technologist called Paul Baran had a Big Idea- that we could make a great communications network by using digital data packets rather than analogue phone lines. He was giggled out of tribunal by AT& T. But it turned out that Baran’s idea was what gave us the internet. What I’m reading\nGone- and forgotten Honestly! Kids these days! Opinion pollster YouGov did a survey to discover how much today’s schoolchildren know about the communications technologies of the past. They were proven 12 pictures of relevant objects from the past- typewriter, Nokia mobile phone, overhead projector, floppy disk, cassette, pager etc. Two-thirds didn’t know what a floppy disk was( though some recognised it as the icon for “Save” ), 27% didn’t recognise a typewriter and 40% didn’t know what an audio cassette was.( On the other hand, analogue nostalgists can take comfort that only a one-quarter of the kids couldn’t recognise a record player. So vinyl may not be a lost cause with future generations. Biggest surprise: 23% didn’t recognise a postcard.\nScandal you say ? Facebook users occupy an ethics-free zone. A Reuters survey has found that the Cambridge Analytica scandal has had no real impact on the individuals who use the service. Three-quarters of US users say they’re using Facebook as much as or more than before the revelations.\nTake back control MIT researchers have constructed a tool that enables you to control what you see in your social media feeds.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR.

A hard fork is usually a fundamental change of the blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology, underpinning a coin. Typically, a hard fork results in two separate coins created, like when Bitcoin Cash forked from core bitcoin in a contentious split over scalability in August , resulting in core and cash versions of the virtual currency. The cash version represented an upgrade to processing power to 8-megabyte units, rather than the one-megabyte block core bitcoin.\nThis hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, however, differs from a conventional hark fork in that no new coins will be created and the older version of BCH will carry no economic value and become obsolete—if all goes well. The upgraded BCH will mean blocksizes will be increased to 32MB, resulting in even faster transactions and lower network fees, according to market participants.\nWhat are altcoins and futures doing? Other alternative coins to bitcoin, or alt coins, are showing small losses to begin Tuesday. Ether ETHUSD, -2.83% is down 0.8% at $731.73, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, -4.93% is off 1.5% at $1,429.30, Litecoin LTCUSD, -6.80% is off 3% at $146.63 and Ripple’s XRP XRPUSD, -3.92% last traded at 74 cents, down 0.4%.\nFutures have had a quiet start to the trading day.

Both companies want to raise up to $1 billion.\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan to raise up to $1 billion each from Hong Kong listings this year, riding on strong global interest in cryptocurrencies, IFR reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the plans.\nCanaan Creative filed a listing application to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Monday, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported.\nZhejiang Ebang Communication has also started working with advisers on a proposed Hong Kong float of up to $1 billion, reported IFR.\nEbang listed on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, in 2015 and was delisted from the over-the-counter market in March after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nChinese bitcoin mining equipment makers are hungry for capital to fund their growth as the heightened interest in cryptocurrencies has led to a surge in demand for their machines.\nCanaan, which sells \"Avalon\" mining machines with customised super-fast ASIC chips, made revenue of more than 1 billion yuan in 2017. Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China's push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan's IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have fluctuated a lot, reported IFR. It was valued at $500 million in mid-2017, IFR said, attributing it to one of the people.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang; Writing by Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>> ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:40:22.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89821e2680c27fa76eb752a93813ad4e83839eaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Z76FDDPLx2.H7FNNu2RN5jI9WZokJMPT3tk9.9uKAvF36ArvfpByS4CCXCWRzGy1MheWcr0.5M.AGSEywRlBXj_TvcaPy2McRHciNQIE7EMIJKFlqtPqpHzvwBbp5yat0ZcasOGzBzw--", "site_full": "www.coinfox.info", "site": "coinfox.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "State exam for Dutch high school students contains math examples on bitcoin | Coinfox", "title_full": "State exam for Dutch high school students contains math examples on bitcoin | Coinfox", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EE", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "http://www.coinfox.info/images/FAIL3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89821e2680c27fa76eb752a93813ad4e83839eaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Z76FDDPLx2.H7FNNu2RN5jI9WZokJMPT3tk9.9uKAvF36ArvfpByS4CCXCWRzGy1MheWcr0.5M.AGSEywRlBXj_TvcaPy2McRHciNQIE7EMIJKFlqtPqpHzvwBbp5yat0ZcasOGzBzw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "State exam for Dutch high school students contains math examples on bitcoin | Coinfox", "text": "Details Published: 15 May 2018\nThe Dutch state examination of mathematics for high school students includes a section with math examples on the first cryptocurrency. The text explains the principles of bitcoin mining, and students need to answer a number of questions requiring mathematical calculations.\nThe VWO is a six-year education stream with a focus on theoretical knowledge, that prepares students to follow a bachelor's degree (WO) at a research university. Students study the VWO at schools known as atheneum and gymnasium and complete the stream around the age of 18. In 2018, a section on bitcoins appeared in the state examination of mathematics. This was discovered by one of the Reddit users.\n\"The bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. He exists since January 1, 2009 and can be used to pay in online stores or for other online services. Bitcoins are not, as normal money, by a central bank circulation. Instead, all bitcoins that are in circulation are created by letting computers work on solutions from selected mathematical problems. That works like this: Anyone can run special software on his or her computer contributes to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that finds the solution to a problem 25 (newly created) bitcoins as a reward. Because in 2014 every 10 minutes such a problem was solved, were there in this way every 25 minutes 25 bitcoins are put into circulation. On 1 January 2014 there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoins in circulation.\"\nHere is the translations of the questions that Dutch high school students (17-18 years old, pre-university) had to make during their national mathematics (with a focus on statistics) finals. Calculate, in which year the volume of bitcoins in circulation will reach 18 million, given that the speed with which they appear does not change. In fact, the speed at which bitcoins fall into circulation is not 25 bitcoins in 10 minutes. This speed is reducing. During the first four years, from January 1, 2009 to January 1, 2013, the reward for solving one problem was 50 bitcoins. The award for finding a solution every four years is halved: from January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2017, the reward for one solution was 25 bitcoins, during the next four years it reduced to 12.5 bitcoins for one solution and so on. From which year will the reward for each solution be less than one bitcoin? The total number of bitcoins that can be put into circulation is limited. This is a consequence (among other things) of the fact that the reward for a decision is always cut by half. The total number of bitcoins in circulation can be described by the formula: C = 21-21 * 0.5 ^ (0.25 * t), where C is the total number of bitcoins in millions, and t is the number of years since January 2009. Use the formula to determine the maximum number of bitcoins in circulation. To regulate the total number of bitcoins in circulation, not only does the reward for solving one problem decrease, but the complexity of mathematical problems also increases. There are more and more people who connect their computers and start to solve these problems. The difficulty of the problems increases exponentially with the formula D = 3.65 * e ^ (0.533 * t), where D is the complexity of the problem, and t is the time in months, starting from January 1, 2013. The larger the D, the more difficult it is to solve the problem. Compose the formula of the derivative of D and explain how to handle this formula can see that the graph of D is increasing. The formula can be rewritten in such a way that you can use a difficulty level fill in and calculate the time in months needed to do so level of difficulty.

Additionally covered are a surprise resignation, another ransomware attack, and much more.\nAlso Read: Steve Eisman of ‘The Big Short’ Fame: What Value Does Cryptocurrency Actually Add? NYDFS Approves Expanded Crypto Portfolio\nNew York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo has announced on Monday that Gemini Trust Company LLC has been authorized to offer the custody services and trading of Zcash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on its exchange based in NYC. She said: “This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.”\nThe addition of Zcash especially seems to have taken the market by surprise, leading to its price jumping over 40% in the last twenty-four hours. Back in March, the founders of the trading venue revealed that adding new cryptocurrency options are high on the company’s agenda this year, with BCH and LTC at the top of the list. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, commented on Monday: “We are proud to be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash, an incredible new form of digital cash.” Surprise CEO Resignation\nChris Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange Okex , has reportedly left his position with the Hong Kong based company. Lee cited personal reasons for his departure, seeking to “start a new life,” the exchange stated on Monday. According to his spokeswoman, Lee added it had been the “greatest pleasure and an honor” to work at Okex and that he will return to the blockchain community after a short break to spend time with his family. The surprising move raised some speculations online as for the reasons. $1 Million Bitcoin Heist Foiled\nAccording to media reports from the state of Georgia, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office found that five young men had conspired to break into a local home and steal nearly $1 million in bitcoin. Their robbery investigation has reportedly been ongoing since January, following a drug bust. The five young men, Justin Ellison, Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South, and Michael McDermont, have been charged with residential strong arm robbery and are being held in a detention center without bond. Australian Sexual Health Provider Held for Ransom\nFamily Planning New South Wales, one of Australia’s largest reproductive and sexual health service providers, has sent out an email to its clients on Monday notifying them that it reported a cyber attack on its website to Australian Federal Police.\n“I want to stress to people that this has absolutely nothing to do with, and has no impact on our clinical medical records, they’ve always been secure,” the organization’s chief executive Ann Brassil said at a press conference on Monday. “There’s no evidence that this cyberattack was on Family Planning NSW itself;…and it appears it was an attack for ransom, so it was financial. The ransom said we are shutting down your website and you pay us $15,000 in Bitcoin for us to release the website, and it had a clock ticking down.” Polish Propaganda\nPolish financial authorities have again been found to spend taxpayers’ money on a smear campaign on social media against investing in cryptocurrencies. Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has issued a new tender order to plan and conduct a campaign aimed at “building awareness” among the public for the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes and forex activities unsupervised by the KNF.\nEarlier this year it was reveled that the Central Bank of Poland and KNF had paid over 90,000 PLN (złoty) to, among others, a Polish Youtube content network which represents many popular young local content creators to produce anti-crypto videos .\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Bing now joins a growing chorus of social media platforms that have banned crypto advertising.\nTwitter announced its ban in March 2018, as CCN has reported. Two weeks before that, search-engine monopoly Google blocked crypto and ICO ads, saying “we’ve seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it’s an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.”\nThe Google decision followed a similar move by Facebook in January 2018. Bitcoin evangelists have responded by saying they plan to file a class-action lawsuit this summer.\nIndustry associations in South Korea, Russia, and China are planning to sue Google, Twitter, and Facebook, alleging there’s a “cartel collusion” among the three corporate juggernauts to manipulate the crypto market. They claim the ban has artificially deflated the prices of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg Embrace Crypto\nDespite these anti-crypto corporate moves, Twitter billionaire Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are bitcoin bulls based on their personal actions and statements, which are pro-crypto.\nDorsey predicts that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will ultimately displace all other currencies, probably within the next 10 years.\n“The world ultimately will have a single currency, the Internet will have a single currency,” Dorsey said in March 2018. “I personally believe that it will be bitcoin.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. (YouTube screenshots)\nSimilarly, Facebook has been in serious discussions to launch its own cryptocurrency as it continues to implement blockchain initiatives, as CCN previously reported.\n“Facebook is specifically interested in creating its own digital token, which would allow its more than two billion users to facilitate transactions without government-backed currency,” according to a Cheddar report.\nZuckerberg also said that one of his top goals for 2018 is to study cryptocurrencies as part of a personal pledge .\n“There are important counter-trends to this –like encryption and cryptocurrency — that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people’s hands,” Zuckerberg said. “I’m interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.”\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anti-bitcoin bandwagon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:17:42.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1757e98cd4a9fc88563ae793629ff4b11ecf2916", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS264hNLvrGh_mb04kMQZfTGju4GJaQ6x5gFfZjH2FuHpUBNqBAxQhbo_Uh8vBpbJg9adpv4kZhp1RhgjXP1IEnUbooJSH90O7LE_EWvmGyjA--", "site_full": "cryptovest.com", "site": "cryptovest.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Japanese Criminals Embrace Cryptos for Money Laundering | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Japanese Criminals Embrace Cryptos for Money Laundering | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.703, "main_image": "https://cryptovest.com/storage/upload/images/posts/3444/big/Man%20stealing%20(1).jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1757e98cd4a9fc88563ae793629ff4b11ecf2916", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS264hNLvrGh_mb04kMQZfTGju4GJaQ6x5gFfZjH2FuHpUBNqBAxQhbo_Uh8vBpbJg9adpv4kZhp1RhgjXP1IEnUbooJSH90O7LE_EWvmGyjA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Japanese Criminals Embrace Cryptos for Money Laundering | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "23 hours ago | 742 shares About\nBitcoin Insight aggregates the latest stories, tweets and videos about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain.

Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world's bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China's push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR and Jennifer Hughes; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang, Alun John and Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Edwina Gibbs) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:32:09.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9dedaf5ef38b41508a217ba6add4be4df3ff04d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXbA32GeZpkoQHMjxIKUYrM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Why people dump their Bitcoins ?", "title_full": "Why people dump their Bitcoins ?", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.207, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9dedaf5ef38b41508a217ba6add4be4df3ff04d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXbA32GeZpkoQHMjxIKUYrM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cling18", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people dump their Bitcoins ?", "text": "Quote: from: OmegaStarScream on October 06, 2015, 09:47:43 AM In your opinion what are the reasons that let someone start dumping his bitcoins and walk away ?\nI personally (and this is just my opinion) that it's more panic then simply his need of money or something else , as we saw on the BitcoinXT last time , people started to panic and simply sold their bitcoins and that caused a drop in the price .\nSimply because they just want to get a good profit.

Coinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading.\nHigh-frequency trading, or HFT firms, use computers to buy and sell stocks, futures and other assets in the blink of eye. They accounted for 55% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market last year, according to research firm Tabb Group LLC, but they have only recently begun to dabble in cryptocurrencies.\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times. Coinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location. HFT firms often put their servers next to the computers that power exchanges like Nasdaq Inc. or the New York Stock Exchange, to minimize the split-second delays associated with transmitting data back and forth between the trading firm and the exchange.\nAccording to Coinbase, the plan will benefit customers by reducing bid-ask spreads—the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset. Advocates of HFT say the growth of high-speed trading in the stock market over the past two decades helped drive bid-ask spreads down to just one penny in many big stocks. But Coinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nRead an extended version of this article at WSJ.com.\nPopular on WSJ.com Tesla CEO Musk Says Company Is ‘Flattening Management Structure’ in Reorganization At Mueller Probe’s First Trial, Expect More Blunt Lectures From the Bench", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-mueller-probes-first-trial-expect-more-blunt-lectures-from-the-bench-1526385601?mod=trending_now_4", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-ceo-musk-says-company-is-flattening-management-structure-inreorganization-1526308678?mod=trending_now_1", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-bitcoin-exchange-welcomes-high-speed-traders-1526385600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tabb group llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:33:55.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ee86434754f826ecf7b9f30d5c341e43a15a35f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyPUL0bWWTugxsNPkCJXG0E-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ee86434754f826ecf7b9f30d5c341e43a15a35f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyPUL0bWWTugxsNPkCJXG0E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nStart earning today, keep your income in your BTC wallet and it will be getting worth more in USD because Bitcoin exchange rate is constantly rising.

In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group.

For donors, sending funds in Bitcoin is easy, as long as the charity has an online wallet set up. And for charities, they can receive funds from around the world, from a modern type of donor, who prefers this payment method.\n“ Bitcoin is an exciting, new digital currency that allows for global payments to happen 24/7, 365 days a year with nominal fees,” says Christopher Moussa, Chief Investment Officer at Crypto Capital Investments. “Charities are beginning to realize the many potential benefits in accepting Bitcoin donations. Being at the forefront of accepting Bitcoin donations opens your organization up to a new community of donors that prefer to deal exclusively with Bitcoin.”\nSounds awesome, right? And it is. But, like anything else in life, you should read the fine print first. If you’re a charity, and you want to accept Bitcoin donations, there are a few things you should know . You don’t let issues such as tax compliance, volatility, and security of your bitcoin donations put you off. But do your research first.\nOnce you’re aware of the possible risks and know how to process bitcoin donations correctly, accepting this type of funding can have major benefits for your charity. Let’s take a look at a few of them here. A Wider Donor Pool\nCharities are up against some pretty stiff competition when it comes to attracting donors. Not only do they have to convince donors to hand out money from their own pockets, but they have to compete with thousands of other causes as well.\nIn the United States alone there are 1.5 million registered nonprofits. Convincing donors to choose yours over the rest is no easy feat.\nAccepting Bitcoin donations not only opens up the potential donor pool, but it gives you a leg up on the competition who don’t accept cryptocurrency. It’s easier for international donors to send money as well. And for donors who prefer complete anonymity, sending Bitcoin is an added incentive.\nJust think about the Pineapple Fund that donated $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charities anonymously. That wouldn’t have been possible without Bitcoin.\nNonprofit consultant , Paul Lamb points out, “One clear benefit is that, as more and more individuals become aware of and comfortable using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the greater the ability of charities to capture new funding streams.” Appealing to the Millennial Demographic\nStartup charities have it particularly hard trying to catch donors’ attention. They usually don’t have the funds to market themselves and aren’t well known to the public. When most people donate, it’s to the biggest charities and the go-to names they’re used to seeing in the media.\nAppealing to millennials should be part of any charity’s priorities. Millennials are more passionate about causes and more altruistic than generations before them (the average millennial donates almost $600 a year to charities). Millennials also happen to be the most active generation using Bitcoin. They’re willing to donate to your cause if you make it as easy for them as possible.\nThere are several crowdfunding platforms that make it easier for small charities to make themselves known, including bitgive and bithope . Once you get your charity in front of the right audience and make it simple for them to donate by accepting Bitcoin, you widen your appeal.\n“Millennials are the demographic most actively using Bitcoin,” says Lamb, “and as charities attempt to recruit younger donors, cryptocurrency is an unpre cedented and growing fundraising opportunity area. Also, the ability to accept Bitcoin carries with it a kind of ahead-of-the-times cache, which can capture the attention of the modern and more innovation-oriented donor.” A Substantial Global Revenue Stream\nIn March, Ripple donated $29 million to DonarsChoose.org so that they could donate to every teachers’ request on the site. This is just one example of cryptocurrencies getting more proactive in philanthropy .\nIt’s not only beneficial to charities but helps blockchain companies address some of the negative press around cryptocurrency and the accusations that most people in it are criminals or only out for personal gain. Charities are primed to take advantage of this goodwill to drive more donations. Getting the Whole Benefit of the Donation\nWhile charities accepting donations through traditional means, such as credit card or PayPal, are subject to fees, with Bitcoin donations, those can be substantially reduced. While transaction fees still exist, they are significantly lower.\n“This allows the nonprofit to realize the full benefit of the donation and it significantly cuts down the processing time,” Moussa explains. “Donations with Bitcoin can be accepted from individuals around the world. The benefits of Bitcoin donations are that the transactions happen quickly, usually within 15 minutes.”\nAccepting bitcoin donations means that you don’t have to pay capital gains, which allows charities to get the whole benefit of the donation–so long as charities understand the volatility of Bitcoin value and the potential tax implications.\nThe main takeaway is that you must be compliant. So don’t accept donations and then recklessly HODL. “ For charity organizations,” Moussa advises, “it is important to note that holding Bitcoin donations as an investment may require them to pay unrelated business income tax on any income that may be realized. Tax professionals are increasing their focus on Bitcoin taxation and will be able to help organizations navigate this new frontier.”\nJeromy Spence, Director of Finance at iComply Investor Services Inc. adds, “In the U.S. where capital gains use the first in first out method, it would be beneficial to donate sooner rather than later so that they could get a tax receipt on their most taxable crypto. There are extra benefits for first-time donors which should also be noted.”\nHowever, he concludes that “ Ultimately charities should be excited and learn how to market to those interested in crypto-donation so that it can be a win-win for the donor and the charity.” Closing Thoughts on Bitcoin Donations\nThere are plenty of benefits from accepting Bitcoin donations for your charity.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR. It was valued at $500 million in mid-2017, IFR said, attributing it to one of the people.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang; Writing by Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:23:31.049+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "188462973d77f531095afde01cea84274de32e57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNSG3Lt25D5__cCK.DY0lf0q26_KcmTrXjCNcn1w9eEKmj6XJ7P_wXCH0hNmsOi0JKG04MYw5ryLgckfDhTitbj0", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Consensus 2018 Features 'Lambos' And Bankers Out of Business | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Consensus 2018 Features 'Lambos' And Bankers Out of Business | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.324, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/05/15092048/lambo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "188462973d77f531095afde01cea84274de32e57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNSG3Lt25D5__cCK.DY0lf0q26_KcmTrXjCNcn1w9eEKmj6XJ7P_wXCH0hNmsOi0JKG04MYw5ryLgckfDhTitbj0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Consensus 2018 Features 'Lambos' And Bankers Out of Business | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Consensus 2018 Features ‘Lambos’ And Bankers Out of Business May 15, 2018 | NEWSBTC | Shares: 9\nBlockchain Week New York City, the most important annual conference for the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, is including gimmicks outside the event, such as actors portraying struggling bankers protesting against Bitcoin and Lamborghinis renewing the success stereotype among digital currency investors. ‘Bankers’ Protests and ‘Lambos’ Outside Blockchain Week Consensus 2018, the Bitcoin conference taking place…\nThe post Consensus 2018 Features ‘Lambos’ And Bankers Out of Business appeared first on NewsBTC.

In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group. Goldman is not among the new round's investors.\nFive-year-old Circle's first product was designed for buying bitcoin and moving traditional money between individuals by using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nBut in the past year, its other business, facilitating big trades of digital currencies, has surged in volume and revenue.\nThat desk, called Circle Trade, says it has traded about $4 billion in the past month, handling trades from institutions, companies and wealthy individuals, Circle said.\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com\n(END) 15, 2018 16:42 ET (20:42 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital currency startup", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "telis demos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle internet financial ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T05:41:45.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96879f517b5f854546f10585dd4e8ceafe058a2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyxGJEBcFsxHeoffaRv96Ky5oJkSfPcYYfyaTYLxQZucjK_fCi83kqMH0iNxzd_6mdrqB7sf11F8IGZEmsUbsCC16ZctIvkuiXUSOxZ7KHvdDYX9S2hDvq", "site_full": "coingeek.com", "site": "coingeek.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin upgrade is done: 32MB blocks, smart contracts now open for business - Coingeek", "title_full": "Bitcoin upgrade is done: 32MB blocks, smart contracts now open for business - Coingeek", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://coingeek.com/app/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-upgrade-done-32mb-blocks-smart-contracts-now-open-business.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96879f517b5f854546f10585dd4e8ceafe058a2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyxGJEBcFsxHeoffaRv96Ky5oJkSfPcYYfyaTYLxQZucjK_fCi83kqMH0iNxzd_6mdrqB7sf11F8IGZEmsUbsCC16ZctIvkuiXUSOxZ7KHvdDYX9S2hDvq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cecille De Jesus", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin upgrade is done: 32MB blocks, smart contracts now open for business - Coingeek", "text": "Bitcoin upgrade is done: 32MB blocks, smart contracts now open for business Tech May 15, 2018\nMerchants and other blockchain projects can now run on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\nLess than a year after its birth, cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is taking several leaps farther ahead of its predecessor. At 16:00 UTC on May 15, the network successfully executed its scheduled network upgrade. The long-awaited block size increase to 32MB is now in effect—a four-fold increase from its previous 8MB limit, and 16 times higher than that of the BTC chain.\nMost importantly, previously disabled OP_Codes have been resurrected. This upgrade will enable smart contracts to run on the chain, which nChain—one of the main teams leading the development of Bitcoin Cash—says has always been in the original Bitcoin vision all along.\n“The fact that Bitcoin was built on top of a scripting language with a rich instruction set suggests that it was always intended to be a base platform that enabled much more complex rulesets to govern the transfer of funds. Restoring bitcoin to its originally intended design (with bugs fixed) is a reason in itself,” wrote Steve Shadders, a developer from nChain .\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash is literally open for business . Merchants and other projects and businesses can now be integrated into the BCH blockchain. This could start off a wave of commercial adoption and effectively push BCH ahead of its older competitors, including Ethereum—which has held dominance over smart contracts but suffered several expensive bugs, hacks, and exploits.\nBased on nChain’s statements, this is just one of many upcoming upgrades to the blockchain, which the developer community will be activating slowly to ensure security.\n“Simply for the sake of continuing the cautious approach. Enabling only a few op codes for the May 15th protocol upgrade not only limits the risk and enables all involved developers to give each op code more attention. By keeping the scope of the change small it gives the BCH developer community a chance to refine the process of enabling such features,” Shadders wrote.\nTo further facilitate integration for businesses and propel mass adoption, a software development kit (SDK) has been made available for free to anyone who wants to build on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\nBitcoin ABC, nChain, and Lokad are leading the development on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, with several other independent teams and individuals contributing to the initiative. But the network is open to all who are interested in contributing further to the cause—decentralized development makes the community stronger and more resistant to influence.\nTogether, the development community aims to materialize the original Bitcoin vision and fulfill its pledge to inclusion—enabling fast, low-cost transactions for the unbanked, and those who cannot afford to lose their earnings to transaction fees and intermediaries. Regardless of trading values, this is and always has been the main principle behind blockchain technology.\nThree days after the network upgrade, CoinGeek will hold its inaugural CoinGeek conference. The conference will be held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong on May 18, and will be the perfect opportunity to discuss the advances generated by the network upgrade. Additionally, a number of cryptocurrency experts, including nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen and Chief Scientist Dr. Craig Wright, along with Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver and other thought leaders will be on hand to provide their expertise on a wide range of topics related to eCommerce, advancements in the BCH technology and the future of the crypto space.\nFind out how you can integrate blockchain into your business by registering for the CoinGeek.com conference today. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins.

After reading many, many different articles all over the internet, I still didn’t have a good idea of what bitcoins were, how they could be made, and if it was possible for the average person to use them. The first few things I read, they were made out to sound like you had to have a computer science degree to get them. However, after reading on about them, I learned that they are a type of currency that is 100% virtual. There is no government that regulates the currency, like almost every other single currency in the world. Instead, it is all virtual. The bitcoins that you own are stored on your computer. You can sell these bitcoins for real US or Canadian dollars. Below is a YouTube video explaining the whole concept of bitcoins. While good for visual learners, some like to read to learn. Bitcoins are a virtual currency. The currency is stored locally between peers. The currency (bitcoins) is transferred from computer to computer. Every transaction (transfer of bitcoins from one computer to another) is verified by “mining” for bitcoins. When first learning about bitcoins, you learn that bitcoins are stored directly on your computer. So, does that mean that by doing a bit of computer hacking you can give yourself thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoins? The answer to this is NO! The system is worked out so well that hackers cannot do this.\nThe reason is because for bitcoins to be transferred from computer to computer, the transaction has to be verified. This verification is done by “mining.” Mining is a process where everyday people like you and I install some software onto their computer. This software is very advanced and hard to understand, but basically it does some high-level computing (SHA256 decoding) to verify transfers of bitcoins. The next question that often comes up is: Why would anyone want to just give up their computer to help decode these encryption things? Well, the answer is that you get paid to do it. Well, you don’t get paid, but you get free bitcoins for letting your computer work for you. This is almost the same as being paid, as you will learn in later steps. This is the ONLY way that new bitcoins are created. They can’t just come from nowhere, making the system hacker-proof. Mining can be very simple, but it can also be very complicated. By following this Instructable, you will learn one of the easiest ways to mine bitcoins and gain money. For more information, check out the Wikipedia Article, at http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/bitcoin as well as the Official Bitcoin Website, at http://www.bitcoin.org/. Step 2: Setting Up a Wallet. This step walks you through the process of installing the “Wallet” software. This software functions as a real wallet: it stores all of your currency, which in this case are bitcoins.\nThe first part of this step is to download the software. Go to the Official Bitcoin Website at http://www.bitcoin.org/. In a box at the top of the page, click the software version that applies to your given OS. The steps are the same for both Mac and Windows users, other than installing different software. Open the file and follow onscreen instructions. When it is done, open up the software from the Start Menu. It will take a few hours to download all blocks to your computer. You must just sit and wait during this time (see pictures). When it is done downloading the blocks (don’t worry about what this means; it’s not important), go over to the “Receive coins” tab up at the top. Right-click on the one existing list item, and click “Edit”. Give it the label “Main” and hit OK. Right-click on it again and click “Copy Address”. This is the unique address that your wallet was given. It is where you receive coins in later steps. The next step tests out your bitcoin wallet and shows you what a transaction looks like. Step 3: Test Your New Bitcoin Wallet.This step is for testing purposes only. Go to Daily Bitcoins at www.dailybitcoins.org. Near the middle of the page, paste your bitcoin address that you copied earlier. Uncheck the “Delay payment to minimize transaction fees” check box. It is to trick people. Enter the captcha (they are very simple ones on this website), and click Send. It will tell you that it was successful. If it didn’t, re-enter the captcha properly. Wait ten minutes and then open up the Bitcoin Wallet software again.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/bitcoin-beginners-guide-how-to-choose-the-best-bitcoin-exchange-part-1/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martedì giugno step", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:25:53.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e39b84655688a9953a11c1ccda15344ede2ba7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREDx4uhUJXp8wDsyiUYLVPQfdXohg5ZxJOBaPsFrp0M5tikJ3j3bh4", "site_full": "www.valuebuddies.com", "site": "valuebuddies.com", "site_section": "https://www.valuebuddies.com/forum-10.html", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "ValueBuddies.com : Value Investing Forum -

Nouri declined to disclose how much the crypto exchange had paid, but said a rental like that typically goes for around $1,000.\nThe flashy cars that symbolize conspicuous consumption among Bitcoin true-believers had caused a stir earlier as they roared through the streets near the hotel.

The firm hired actors to portray aggrieved bankers who will lose their financial services jobs when blockchain takes over the industry.\nThe gimmicks show that the hype that surrounded Bitcoin as it burst on the mainstream last year remains alive and well even after the biggest digital coin fell more than 50 percent from its December peak of almost $20,000.\nGenesis said the protest was a “fun way” to show how crypto can upend banking “if they fail to adapt to the new world we live in,” according to a blog post on its website.\nA hundred feet away, MK Li stood in front of the revolving hotel doors with a sign that read “Help a fellow VC to pay for this expensive conference!” Sporting a pink button-down shirt with a purple bowtie, the conference goer was accepting donations in digital tokens — a way to protest the hefty price he’d paid for a conference about a technology that was meant to eliminate the need for expensive middlemen.\nTicket prices ranged from from $1,499 to $2,999, suggesting that organizer CoinDesk Inc. raked in at least $12.8 million in revenue from admissions alone. There are also more than 100 sponsors such as IBM, SAP and Microsoft Corp.\nInside the hotel, several floors up, one peeved attendee said to another, “How is this not a fire-code violation?’’ The two stood in the doorway of a packed ballroom, straining their necks to get a glimpse of a presentation about Cryptogaphic Innovations.\nThe hype is real at Consensus, the biggest of about two dozen events that make up “Blockchain Week.’’ So far, the conference — which is expected to bring in more than 8,000 people this year — has featured flannels, business suits, cowboy hats and dreadlocks amid a standing-room only sea of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts.\nSima Baktas, who works for a blockchain startup in Istanbul, sported a T-shirt that said “Satoshi is Female,’’ — a reference to the mysterious and still-unknown author of the original Bitcoin whitepaper.

Coinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading.\nHigh-frequency trading, or HFT firms, use computers to buy and sell stocks, futures and other assets in the blink of eye. They accounted for 55% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market last year, according to research firm Tabb Group LLC, but they have only recently begun to dabble in cryptocurrencies.\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times. Coinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location. HFT firms often put their servers next to the computers that power exchanges like Nasdaq Inc. or the New York Stock Exchange, to minimize the split-second delays associated with transmitting data back and forth between the trading firm and the exchange.\nAccording to Coinbase, the plan will benefit customers by reducing bid-ask spreads—the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset. Advocates of HFT say the growth of high-speed trading in the stock market over the past two decades helped drive bid-ask spreads down to just one penny in many big stocks. But Coinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nRead an extended version of this article at WSJ.com.\nPopular on WSJ.com Tesla CEO Musk Says Company Is ‘Flattening Management Structure’ in Reorganization At Mueller Probe’s First Trial, Expect More Blunt Lectures From the Bench", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-mueller-probes-first-trial-expect-more-blunt-lectures-from-the-bench-1526385601?mod=trending_now_4", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-ceo-musk-says-company-is-flattening-management-structure-inreorganization-1526308678?mod=trending_now_1", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-bitcoin-exchange-welcomes-high-speed-traders-1526385600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tabb group llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:05:08.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9eae2aae59e9a8c14d27b87cef167c02be69a42e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_ydsivV8OKCNCTBF1Nbrmw-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9eae2aae59e9a8c14d27b87cef167c02be69a42e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_ydsivV8OKCNCTBF1Nbrmw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!
