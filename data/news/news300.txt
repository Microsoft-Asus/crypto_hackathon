For Williams, a former Heisman Trophy winner, the future is in astrology, and when he looked up, the stars aligned for him to buy cryptocurrencies. Williams told CNBC:\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.”\nIn astrology, a new moon is synonymous with new beginnings, and for Williams, that means entering the cryptocurrency market. This month, astrologists have much to celebrate with the moon rising in Taurus, a sign of positive things to come. But in a rare occurrence, Uranus, which Williams describes using familiar cryptocurrency features like “revolution” and “innovation”, happens to be moving away from Aries and inching closer to Taurus, which like cryptocurrency prices is reflective of some volatility.\n“We’re going to totally change the way we view and understand” the financial system, he told CNBC.\nIt gets deeper (so to speak). Pluto, which is now identified as a dwarf planet, is in retrograde with Capricorn, which Williams believes is a sure sign to re-examine financial “structures like banks.”\nHe explained:\n“I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action.”\nTwo-Point Conversion Williams is not the only NFL-er to have caught cryptocurrency fever. Richard Sherman, who helped lead the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl win in 2014, is the spokesperson for cryptocurrency trading platform Cobinhood, which boasts no trading fees, though he reportedly dissuaded his grandmother from investing.\nWilliams is a former Heisman Trophy winner who spent 12 years with the National Football League (NFL) and one year with the Canadian Football League. He was the best in college, where he attended the University of Texas. But his NFL contract in the late nineties — though worth a potential $68 million — wouldn’t reflect that, given lofty milestones to earn that peak and a disenchanted Williams, and it is still looked to among future players as an example of how not to negotiate.\nSo when it comes to cryptocurrencies, Williams is playing it safe, pouring no more than $50,000 in to start. He told CNBC he “didn’t want to go crazy.” His cautious approach is understandable, considering he pocketed a reported $14 million out of that potential $68 million and he also lost millions in pay including athlete endorsements for failing drug tests.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ricky will", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:08:35.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69ed772a3af6579029cfc06fe69cbf229bd78904", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRl_T9af0gByxfqJ_9SY2AsxxT59AoHvDpoqKRyctYEA_jW8mk5dj50obEXVc6zg_mVYC0RxTkPRtUxrMpKkDOiZkFXmOHrbJVRAjeuCY6v0fss1hyzI9bxKUt2iW.XChFG5YdczonCcg--", "site_full": "btcbrainpro.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://btcbrainpro.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Price Could Reach $64,000 in 2019: Fundstrat Analysis – BTC Brain", "title": "Bitcoin Price Could Reach $64,000 in 2019: Fundstrat Analysis", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Could Reach $64,000 in 2019: Fundstrat Analysis", "published": "2018-05-11T21:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69ed772a3af6579029cfc06fe69cbf229bd78904", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRl_T9af0gByxfqJ_9SY2AsxxT59AoHvDpoqKRyctYEA_jW8mk5dj50obEXVc6zg_mVYC0RxTkPRtUxrMpKkDOiZkFXmOHrbJVRAjeuCY6v0fss1hyzI9bxKUt2iW.XChFG5YdczonCcg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcbrainpro", "published": "2018-05-11T21:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Could Reach $64,000 in 2019: Fundstrat Analysis", "text": "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-could-reach-64000-in-2019-fundstrat-analysis/ via /r/bitcoin_uncensored https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/8ipd5z/bitcoin_price_could_reach_64000_in_2019_fundstrat/?utm_source=ifttt ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:24:11.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c22736fb9f362a0b610fbcdea968f329d4bad553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWVTjQg3Xvt4v.TbZaZh0Vk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=207.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Investor-based games", "title": "Double your bitcoins in 24 hours 2018 (PAYING)", "title_full": "Double your bitcoins in 24 hours 2018 (PAYING)", "published": "2018-05-11T21:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.174, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c22736fb9f362a0b610fbcdea968f329d4bad553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWVTjQg3Xvt4v.TbZaZh0Vk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LennyBaptist", "published": "2018-05-11T21:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Double your bitcoins in 24 hours 2018 (PAYING)", "text": "Hello !

Between March 2010 and mid-December 2017, the value of an individual bitcoin token surged from a low of $0.003 to (briefly) more than $20,000 per token. A prescient $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you could find someone willing to part with that many bitcoin (333,333 tokens), would have been worth billions of dollars as of this past December.\nCryptocurrency optimists view bitcoin and blockchain technology as a game-changers for monetary theory and how currency is transferred from one party to another, which is a big reason bitcoin has been so successful thus far.\nBitcoin&apos;s underlying blockchain is its digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that works around traditional banking networks to record and process transactions. Most notably, blockchain offers the ability to transfer funds from one party to another considerably quicker than with current banking networks, especially in cross-border transactions. Sending funds overseas may take moments to validate and settle with blockchain, whereas traditional banking networks may take up to five business days to settle cross-border remittances.\nStop comparing bitcoin to gold! They're nothing alike The world&apos;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also drawn regular comparisons to gold, which is viewed as the go-to investment anytime fear, volatility, and/or inflation rear their heads. This comparison takes shape given the relative scarcity of each asset. In other words, there&apos;s a 21-million-coin limit on the number of bitcoin that can be mined, just as there&apos;s a limit on the amount of gold that can be mined from our planet. Therefore, the assumption has been made that bitcoin can act as a store of value much in the same way gold has for investors.\nHowever, I&apos;m here to tell you, again , and for the last time, that you shouldn&apos;t believe everything you hear about bitcoin. It isn&apos;t, and will never be , the \"new gold.\" How do I know this? The answer lies in a number of comparative tests that bitcoin simply fails when put side by side with gold.\nThere's absolutely no application comparison Advertisement\nTo begin with, there&apos;s the application of gold versus bitcoin. Bitcoin exists in the digital realm as code . It&apos;s not tangible. You can&apos;t put it in your hand or do anything with it, aside from using it as a medium of exchange, or hoping that someone else comes along at a later date and pays more for it, per token, than you did.\nOn the other hand, gold is a physical asset that can be held in the palm of one&apos;s hand. It also has practical uses, such as being a conductor in electronic equipment, as the primary metal in fine jewelry, and as crowns in the cosmetic dental industry, to name a few uses. One asset is tangible and has practical use, the other exists entirely within the digital realm. Not comparable.\nA false sense of scarcity Another comparison that fails to hold muster is scarcity. When it comes to gold, all we&apos;re ever going to have is what&apos;s on this planet. Putting aside science fiction hype of mining asteroids, what we have in the ground and have already mined is all the gold we&apos;re ever going to get. That provides a true physical cap on gold, allowing investors to make a genuine case for scarcity.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin does have a 21-million-coin cap, but this is only limited by protocols . Admittedly, getting consensus on bitcoin&apos;s network to increase the coin limit would be very difficult -- but the point is that it&apos;s not impossible. We can&apos;t wave a wand and make more gold appear out of thin air, but computer coders with the backing of the bitcoin community could do just that and create more bitcoin.\nTo add to this point, even without increasing the coin limit above 21 million, bitcoin&apos;s numerous hard forks essentially violate the idea of a token limit and scarcity. Bitcoin has had three instances since August where a disagreement between developers on the future path of bitcoin and its blockchain resulted in the creation of a new currency. These spinoffs of sorts -- Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private -- topple the idea of true scarcity, as new coins have been, or could continue to be, created from bitcoin.\nGold has history on its side In terms of which asset has history on its side, that, too, goes to gold. Gold has been used as a currency for more than 2,700 years and is today a highly liquid asset, at least in terms of futures contract trading. It&apos;s also an asset held by central banks all over the globe. While you&apos;re not likely to pay for your morning cup of coffee with a gold ingot, gold has been viewed as an accepted form of currency for a long time.\nHowever, bitcoin doesn&apos;t have that tenured history. There are no fundamental tethers that allow investors to make a reasonable determination about bitcoin&apos;s value, and liquidity on bitcoin futures contracts has been spotty at times. Additionally, there are no governments holding bitcoin in their vaults, as they do with gold.\nThe bottom line is that gold and bitcoin are nothing alike -- and to think that bitcoin will behave similarly to gold could prove to be a big mistake.\nBitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you now When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Even though this tech venture capitalist considers himself a ‘disciple’ of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, he doesn’t endorse latter’s views on the subject of Bitcoin. “Not everybody is right all the time,” CEO, Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC. The knowledge about technology is not in the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO’s “circle of competence,” he also said. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett along company’s vice chairman Charlie Munger went on another bitcoin bashing spree this month at the firm’s annual shareholders meeting held last Saturday. Buffett said that bitcoin was “rat poison squared” and that cryptocurrencies would “come to a bad ending,” at the event.\nExplaining the complexity in understanding Bitcoin, Palihapitiya said that Bitcoin is not correlated to the rest of the market. Palihapitiya also added that he feels he is “in two different universes. I need a passport to go between the bitcoin world and the regular world.” The younger generation sees Bitcoin as replacement to gold, he said. “Bitcoin is replacement to traditional financial infrastructure,” he added.\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger are geniuses but “ in what they do,” he added. It’s important to remember what happened during the financial crisis, Palihapitiya said. “Everything broke down” and “things that we thought were hedges went away.” On Wednesday morning, Bitcoin that attracts huge criticism was around $9,275, according to industry site CoinDesk.\nBitcoin price has plunged significantly since the start of this year. For a brief period, in the later part of the last year, Bitcoin even touched $20,000-mark. The popular cryptocurrency is under huge pressure in wake of increasing regulatory crackdown in different parts of the world. Even back in India, RBI , recently banned of bitcoin trading and asked all the entities regulated by it to cut off ties with any such platforms in the given time period.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "palihapitiya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters/rick wilking eve", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "chamath palihapitiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "social capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T11:20:31.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9002a04495ff1aaa7e4183c72e618d800baaca2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtGGPz8c7n4gPwx4rXwcM0izeogSD.biPdozgrbIYTcZfHTeNK1T.NWl_ovfUYrvDtz3h8mJsiS69CwoyJ9870xakgEdQobJW1I-", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed/", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain Bitcoin.com Store Adds More Hot New Items and Amazon Gift Cards", "title_full": "#Blockchain Bitcoin.com Store Adds More Hot New Items and Amazon Gift Cards", "published": "2018-05-11T21:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BcomStore-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9002a04495ff1aaa7e4183c72e618d800baaca2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtGGPz8c7n4gPwx4rXwcM0izeogSD.biPdozgrbIYTcZfHTeNK1T.NWl_ovfUYrvDtz3h8mJsiS69CwoyJ9870xakgEdQobJW1I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-11T21:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain Bitcoin.com Store Adds More Hot New Items and Amazon Gift Cards", "text": "#Blockchain Bitcoin.com Store Adds More Hot New Items and Amazon Gift Cards Posted on by Startup365\nLast month we re-opened our Bitcoin.com Store after some construction and a bit of hiatus.

Between March 2010 and mid-December 2017, the value of an individual bitcoin token surged from a low of $0.003 to (briefly) more than $20,000 per token.\nA prescient $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you could find someone willing to part with that many bitcoin (333,333 tokens), would have been worth billions of dollars as of this past December. Cryptocurrency optimists view bitcoin and blockchain technology as a game-changers for monetary theory and how currency is transferred from one party to another, which is a big reason bitcoin has been so successful thus far.\nBitcoin’s underlying blockchain is its digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that works around traditional banking networks to record and process transactions. Most notably, blockchain offers the ability to transfer funds from one party to another considerably quicker than with current banking networks, especially in cross-border transactions.\nSending funds overseas may take moments to validate and settle with blockchain, whereas traditional banking networks may take up to five business days to settle cross-border remittances. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also drawn regular comparisons to gold, which is viewed as the go-to investment anytime fear, volatility, and/or inflation rear their heads.\nThis comparison takes shape given the relative scarcity of each asset. In other words, there’s a 21-million-coin limit on the number of bitcoin that can be mined, just as there’s a limit on the amount of gold that can be mined from our planet.

But as much as they love to talk about it, the wealthiest Americans aren't jumping like you'd expect them to.\nThey seem to think that Bitcoin's rise is all but over.\nMost of the gains to be had from Bitcoin have already been made. Sitting at a price of over $15,000 today, ordinary investors are getting a serious case of sticker shock.\nWhich has presented us with a new up-and-coming digital currency .\nUnlike Bitcoin, this currency isn't making front page news left and right. However, those in the know in Silicon Valley insist that it will be essential to the full adoption of digital currency into everyday American life...\nThis little-known digital currency soared in 2017. In fact, the gains investors have seen from this new currency are even BIGGER than what Bitcoin investors are making ...\nBut it's still in its infancy (unlike Bitcoin). Even though many of my fellow Silicon Valley experts are preparing for it to explode, most ordinary investors haven't even heard of it.\nToday, it can be had for much cheaper than the bloated price of Bitcoin. We're urging you to learn more about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity right now before you hear about it from mainstream news outlets.\nBecause if history is any indication, once the media starts paying attention, this new digital currency is likely to blow up, and it will already be too late to capture most of the profits.\nAs any Bitcoin investor will tell you, it often doesn't matter how much you put into this industry-shattering new technology...\nWhat matters the most is that you \" get in \" early.\nThat's why Money Morning Venture Capital Strategist, Michael Robinson, is sharing his urgent briefing with you today (and revealing exactly what this mysterious new currency is)...\nRead it carefully here to learn what you should do next.\nTo Your Success,\nMike Ward\nPublisher, Money Morning\nIf you do not want to receive emails from us, you can follow this link to unsubscribe.\nIf you can't see this message, view it in your browser .

the most famous cryptocurrency", "text": "In the beginning Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and the blockchain. And the blockchain was without rival and bitcoin was without worth and only a fringe group known as cypher punks saw the technology and said that it was good. When the Genesis Block of bitcoin appeared in January 2009, two months after a paper describing the “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”, its small group of followers realised the cryptocurrency held the potential to rip a hole right through the traditional financial system.\nAt the time, the world was still reeling from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a historical moment noted by bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator in a message embedded in the first block of bitcoins: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Bitcoin’s promise lay in the fact that as the world’s first decentralized digital currency, it was a payment outside the scope of banks and governments and therefore immune to the pressures and whims of such institutions.\nBut almost 10 years on, while its potential to disrupt the established financial order is still being realised, the only thing that has actually torn apart is bitcoin itself.\nYou do not have access to view this Atom. On 1 August 2017, the blockchain of bitcoin – an online ledger that documents every transaction – was split in two, spawning a brand new rival to the original cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash. The process, known as a hard fork, meant both versions of bitcoin shared the same blockchain history up until that date but from that point on would be two entirely separate entities.\nThere has since been more hard forks splitting the cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin gold and bitcoin private, however none were as truly divisive as that of bitcoin cash. Its purpose was to solve the two main issues that had arisen with bitcoin as its popularity grew: slow transaction times and high fees.\nThe scalability problem, as it is known, has served to split not just the cryptocurrency itself, but the entire community that has helped develop it over the last nine years.\nThe new cryptocurrency is currently only worth around 15 per cent of the original bitcoin – or bitcoin core – yet its improved functionality means some of the original cypher punks believe it is “the one true bitcoin”. Its most prominent advocate is Roger Ver, whose involvement with bitcoin since its early days earned him the moniker ‘Bitcoin Jesus’.\n“Bitcoin cash has more of the characteristics that make bitcoin bitcoin, than bitcoin core,” Mr Ver tells The Independent . “What matters is if it works as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system – and bitcoin cash simply works better.”\nThe disillusionment Mr Ver felt with the original bitcoin began in 2015 when he realised that some bitcoin core supporters were in favour of high fees. Increased fees meant increased profits for some cryptocurrency companies, despite it going against the founding principles of bitcoin. The average fee for a single transaction last year was $28, making it entirely impractical for use as digital cash.\nDucatus cafe, a cashless cafe that accepts cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, on their opening day in Singapore December 21, 2017 (Reuters) Another vocal supporter of bitcoin cash is James Howells. The IT specialist from Newport, Wales, made headlines in 2013 after it emerged he had accidentally thrown away a computer hard drive containing 7,500 bitcoins, worth around £4 million at the time. At today’s prices, the value of the hard drive is worth more than £50 million – it sits buried beneath trash in a landfill site near his home in south Wales for anyone who fancies a treasure hunt.\n“At the time of the split in August 2017, as an early bitcoin adopter I felt I had to step up and defend the original goals and vision of bitcoin,” Mr Howells tells The Independent .\n“Bitcoin core has leaned towards catering to investors and financial companies and is no longer interested in being a usable day-to-day cryptocurrency, but wants to stay as a store of value. Unfortunately, it is the use-case as digital cash that gives it the store of value in the first place. If you cannot easily transact with bitcoin due to high fees, then how can it be a good store of value? Bitcoin cash is both.”\nMr Howell describes an online battle between the two sides, with each side trying to discredit the other and claim the bitcoin brand.\nThe most prominent battlegrounds have been the forums of Reddit, the social news site that has helped foster cryptocurrency communities since bitcoin's beginnings.\nAlong with the gripes about bitcoin core's technology, the bitcoin cash side has claimed it is the victim of censorship through posts being deleted in the main bitcoin forum.\nOn the other side, the bitcoin core community claims bitcoin cash advocates are partaking in a campaign of misinformation in an attempt to steal bitcoin's brand.\n\"They're trying to rewrite history and make use of the Bitcoin.com domain name, the r/btc Reddit section, and the @Bitcoin Twitter [account] to create a sense of ambiguation between the two coins,\" says cryptocurrency blogger Vlad Kostea in a detailed post on the feud.\n\"The entire scenario is very much like the propaganda you'd read from the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four : Repetition creates intellectual consent, history must be rewritten after every minor change according to the will of those in power, and words change their meaning for the sake of imposing an agenda.\"\nThe bitcoin core side also claims that any issues with slow transactions and high fees can be solved by building new technology on top of it, such as the Lightning Network – a 'second layer' payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain to enable instant transactions.\n\"The issues with bitcoin that bitcoin cash claims to solve are actually already being solved by bitcoin developers,\" Michael Jackson, a cryptocurrency expert and the former COO of Skype, tells The Independent . \"Bitcoin is still by far the best known and there is so much talent in the crypto space that any issues arising with bitcoin will be solved because they have to be.\"\nThe casualties of the Bitcoin brand battle will be the uninformed noobs. Savvy investors do due diligence and won't be bamboozled by marketing.\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) 14 February 2018 Ultimately, by sticking to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision, bitcoin cash supporters believe the new cryptocurrency will overtake bitcoin as the world’s most valuable digital currency, an event referred to as “the flippening”.\nAmong those offering bold predictions for bitcoin cash is Mr Ver, AKA Bitcoin Jesus, who believes bitcoin cash will overtake bitcoin core’s market cap by 2020 .\n“When we’re talking about upper limits, hundreds of thousands of dollars are well within the realm of possibility,” he says, citing big investors getting involved in the new cryptocurrency. “People love to chase a rising star.”\nBeyond investors, bitcoin cash already shares some of the same characteristics as bitcoin in its early years. It has many of the same developers, together with the same kind of grassroots movement pushing for greater merchant acceptance and wider adoption. Enthusiasts have even set up a bitcoin cash ‘faucet’ offering free units of the cryptocurrency to encourage new users. With all this, the price of bitcoin cash is already catching up with the original and a flippening is not beyond the realm of possibility.\nI wonder what BTC miners will do when BCH takes over and they are left holding digital beanie babies nobody will buy...\nSuch short term thought in some...\nOh well... why I love capitalism\n— Dr Craig S Wright (@ProfFaustus) 18 April 2018 But bitcoin cash is just one of more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies that have emerged since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, according to Coinmarketcap . It was not the first and will likely not be the last to attempt to overcome bitcoin’s perceived limitations. Cryptocurrencies like ethereum and dash offer similar functionality, but without widespread adoption none will be able to fully realise bitcoin’s promise of being the dominant electronic cash system.\n“The limitations of bitcoin core has seen a lot of developers jump ship and move onto these newer cryptocurrencies,” Mr Ver says, referring to a “brain drain” that means many of the best developers have moved away from bitcoin core.\n“Ultimately, not even bitcoin cash is the one and only true version of bitcoin – People will have to read Satoshi’s original white paper and decide for themselves what really defines it.”\nThe Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

All over the world miners have set up operations, big and small, as they look to capitalize on dwindling Bitcoin rewards from processing transactions and validating the blockchain.\nWith plenty at stake, the costs of setting up even a small operation can be hefty, from the actual hardware to cooling systems and electricity consumption. However, those with enough capital to buy the best hardware, namely ASIC miners, put themselves in a commanding position.\nBut that also makes them a target for criminals. Whether these crooks want to hack your system and steal your valuable cryptocurrency or make off with your physical hardware, the potential dangers are real.\nThe latter scenario grabbed headlines this month, as over 600 computers used to mine Bitcoin have been seized in China, valued at over $2 mln alone.\nFrom Iceland to China? The seized equipment is being linked to a series of thefts in Iceland late last year. Three separate incidents spanning from December to January led to a total of 600 computers being stolen by a number of culprits.\nThe Associated Press reported that eleven people were initially arrested, while two men were kept in custody for the burglaries — one of which took place in January at a data center that was housing computers used for Bitcoin mining.\nIcelandic IT firm Advania produced surveillance footage of thieves stealing computers from a data center in Reykjanesbær in January, which positively identified the two men that were in custody, according to local news outlet Visir.\nIn April, one of the culprits managed to escape from custody and fled to Sweden using a fake passport to board a flight to Stockholm. Sindri Þór Stefánsson later said he would return to Iceland in a statement. He claimed he had the right to travel at the time since his custody ruling had expired on April 16.\nTo date, Icelandic authorities have been unable to trace the stolen equipment. Police had asked IT service providers, electricians, and storage units in the country to report any unusual spikes in power use in the hopes they could track down the stolen mining computers.\nTwo months later, Chinese police seized 600 computers in Tianjin in what seems to be more than just a crazy coincidence. The operation caught the attention of Tianjin police after the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage at the location where the equipment was being operated.\nGiven that the number of computers is exactly the same, there’s a good possibility they could be the PCs from Iceland. Icelandic police have reached out to Chinese authorities to try and link the two cases.\nStill need to be connected Icelandic authorities are still waiting on their Chinese counterparts to respond to their requests for collaboration. If and when they do, it shouldn’t be difficult to link the computer equipment at the very least. Given that the computers were stolen from Advania’s data center, it’s almost certain that the serial numbers of components will be available.\nThis could then be cross-checked with the computers seized in Tianjin to positively link the hardware. While the owners of the hardware will no doubt be pleased to recover their property, the investigation has the potential to uncover a nefarious crime syndicate.\nIcelandic police commissioner Olafur Helgi Kjartansson was quoted saying, “This is a grand theft on a scale unseen before,” adding that it was a “highly organized crime”. With numerous suspects being investigated in both China and Iceland, authorities have the chance to apprehend criminals that are preying on the cryptocurrency community.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icelan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:08:35.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc96cd5cdced5e92f856d5f9e9ad82f04acf097d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY.6fzRfImwFCp85RH672Y8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-11T20:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc96cd5cdced5e92f856d5f9e9ad82f04acf097d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY.6fzRfImwFCp85RH672Y8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoincole", "published": "2018-05-11T20:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: ranman09 on Today at 12:41:14 PM For our country, it is because of the news and the words of mouths that bitcoin is scam.

The latest development follows is the a series of crackdowns from law enforcement agencies on cryptocurrency exchange platforms. In April, the president of Coinnest, another exchange in Korea was also arrested. Upbit HQ Raided\nA joint team of the Seoul police, the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU), and the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) conducted a raid on the Upbit headquarters in the Gangnam. The law enforcement and financial regulatory officials confiscated both paper and digital records and are reportedly in the process of combing through the lot to obtain evidence.\nThe raid took place on May 10, 2018, and local police have declined to give any comment other than to say that the matter was still under investigation.\nReports making the rounds in the country reveal that the Upbit is being investigated for engaging in illegal movement of cryptos from the wallets of their clients. The platform is also accused of altering their books to hide their wrongdoing. According to news sources, authorities suspect that client funds are being moved to wallets owned by executives of the platform without the knowledge of the depositors. An audit of Upbit’s holdings is already underway to determine the platform’s culpability.\nRumour in the air is that Vice-Chairman of Etoday, who probably takes major decisions at Bithumb was behind this news since it was first covered by Etoday . Bithumb is one of the largest Korean crypto exchange and competitor of Upbit.\nUpbit has confirmed the investigation with a statement on its website, saying:\n“Upbit is currently under investigation by the prosecution, and we are working diligently. Upbit servic es s uch as all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally. Your assets are kept securely in your account, so you can rest assured that you can use Upbit services.” Crypto Community Reaction\nReactions from the crypto community on social media and online message boards are split between worry over the potential impact on crypto prices and notions that it is a bit of an exaggeration. Advertisement advertisement\nSome analysts believe that regulatory scrutiny often has a negative effect on the market. Indeed, some of the more significant crypto price bombs have come on the back of regulatory crackdowns. These interventions of oversight agencies tend to dampen the level of enthusiasm in the market which usually devolves into panic selloffs. Other analysts have declared that the market reaction is a bit exaggerated given that the platform is still operational. Bitcoin Price Drops Below $9,000\nCrypto prices have declined within the past 24 hours, and the situation with UPbit is seen by some as being connected. The price of bitcoin has dropped below $9,000 since May 10, 2018 a decrease of more than seven percent from the end of May 9, 2018.\nBTC-USD hit a low of $8,400 on the Bitstamp exchange on May 11. BTCManager ’s latest weekly crypto market outlook highlighted $8,537.58 as an important support level, so as long as this level holds, we should see an upward move over the coming days. A daily close below $8,537.58 would suggest a new trend formation according to the daily Renko chart, entering into a downward trend. Weekly support is found at $8,188.07.\nEthereum’s ether , as well as many of the top 100 cryptos, have also declined within the last 24 hours. Upbit FUD Bloodbath? Source: CoinMarketCap\nNegative comments from Bill Gates, Charlie Munger, and Warren Buffett, as well as reports that the Mt. Gox trustee is set for another massive sell off , may have also contributed to the decline.\nThe decline in crypto prices comes as the industry gets set for the 2018 edition of the Blockchain Week in New York, a period that historically preceded rallies in the crypto market .

The journalists then fatefully added:\nThat leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity.\nThe funds linked to the public address provided in the original article currently total 13.35 BTC ($117,000).\nLesson Learned (Again): Hodl Wired's failure to \"hodl\" provides a curious window into the mindset of many casual cryptocurrency experimenters at the time.\n\"Naturally, our first impulse was to use the Bitcoins to replenish our old pal, Beer Robot, (San Francisco's Pacific Brewing Laboratory said they'd sell us a keg for BTC 1.5),\" the miners wrote on the topic of how to spend the funds. \"But that didn't pass the journalistic ethics sniff test.\"\nWhen the private keys were lost forever, BTC/USD was averaging around $115 . Wired continued to receive mining payouts of around 0.02 BTC until the end of 2013.\nWhile the publication has yet to comment on the increasingly widely-circulating faux pas , its efforts still pale in comparison to the infamous Pizza Day episode from 2010.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Pizza Index , even as prices fall under $9,000 on May 11th, the cost of the original $41 order is currently $89,430,000 – or 10,000 BTC.\nWhat do you think about the Wired private key episode?

These Reasons Will Convince You By\nBitcoin is a form of digital currency that can be used to perform business transactions (buying real-world goods) or saved as an investment. It’s known as a decentralized system because it operates without a central bank or single administrator. Below are reasons why you should invest in Bitcoin.\nYou can easily use it to buy goods and services\nAn increasing number of organizations are now accepting bitcoins as payment – and this is expected to grow dramatically over the next few years. Among the companies already involved are global software giant Microsoft, which accepts bitcoins in its Windows and Xbox stores and Expedia, the travel booking website. The numbers are expected to go up in the next few years.\nIt’s easy to buy\nBuying or investing in Bitcoin is easy. You choose one of the best Bitcoin wallet which is available online to start buying and selling Bitcoin. You are not investing for today but for the future because it will definitely increase.\nGovernments and regulators are gradually accepting Bitcoins\nWhen bitcoins came into existence in 2009, most governments and financial regulators were skeptical because the digital currency did not have any centralized regulation. They were also concerned with the anonymity of transactions. This, however, has changed with time.\nThe image of Bitcoins is slowly improving\nThe use of bitcoins used to be associated with criminal activities in the past. Its anonymity allowed anyone to send money to somebody else without disclosing his or her identity. It is for that reason that some fonts viewed bitcoins as being a currency of the criminal world.

Bitcoin Slips Back Below 200-Day Moving Average\nThe recent move in Bitcoin below the 200-day moving average and the uptrend from the February 6 low casts a bearish shadow on the largest cryptocurrency. While BTC’s falls have been less than other tokens over the last 48-hours, the move may signal lower prices in the short-term although the longer-term uptrend remains in place for now. The 50-day moving average at $8,280 may provide some support, along with a cluster of trades between April 13 to April 20, although a sharp break and close below may negate the recent uptrend and threaten the April 1 low at $6,438. The 200-day ma, currently at $9,374 coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $9,385 and should provide resistance in the short-term. Bitcoin (BTC) Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (June 2017 – May 11, 2018) Ripple Breaks Down with Further Losses Eyed\nAnother poor week for Ripple with the token falling from $0.84 to a current level of $0.675 as sellers dominate. We have discussed how the token, along with Ether, is supposedly being talked about by the SEC over whether or not it should be classified as a security – a negative outcome – and with little in the way of news flow, the bears still control price action. The February 13 swing high at $0.708 was broken easily, as was the April 25 swing low at $0.747, leaving a gap on the April 12 candle around $0.60 the next level of downside interest. To the upside, the previously mentioned $0.70 and $0.75 levels remain as short-term targets. IG Client Sentiment shows that traders are 26 to 1 long-to-short, while the RSI indicator shows the token in extreme oversold territory. Ripple (XRP) Four Hour Price Chart in US Dollars (April 27 – May 11, 2018) Ethereum Nears Fibonacci Support\nAnother token hit by the general market sell-off, and the talk of SEC classification, Ethereum is nearing 61.8% Fibonacci support at $667 ahead of the 200-day moving average at $614.5. The cluster of trades in late April-early May that preceded the May 3 spike higher should also give the token support on the downside. On the upside $763 and $810 remain valid targets. As with Ripple however, any ruling either way on Ether’s classification by the SEC – or a denial of any ongoing classification meetings – will be the driver of Ether in the short-term. Ethereum (ETH)Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (August 18, 2017 – May 11, 2018) Litecoin Oversold and Testing Support Levels\nA sharp sell-off this week has pushed Litecoin into oversold territory, according to the Relative Strength Indicator, and on top of 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $137 and the April 3 double top at $136. A break lower could see $125 tested. To the upside $146 and $155 provide the first two targets.

(Source: Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office) GREENVILLE, SC (WIS) -\nAn Upstate woman has been convicted after attempting to sell drugs over the dark web.\nThe United States Attorney Beth Drake announced that Ana Milena Barrero, 24, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Federal Court in Greenville on Friday.\nEvidence presented at the change of plea hearing and at the sentencing hearing showed that Barrero and her boyfriend, Theodore Khleborod, formed an agreement to sell large quantities of opioids, including U-47700 and fentanyl, using a dark web internet site called “AlphaBay.”\nInterfacing with customers on AlphaBay under the username “PetertheGreat,” Khleborod and Barrero would ship opioids to customers via the U.S. Mail, and these customers would pay for the drugs using bitcoin.\nThe investigation ended in the arrest of Khleborod and Barrero on April 26, 2017, and a search of their apartment in downtown Greenville.\nPolice seized approximately 43 pounds of substances they believe to be opioids during the search of the apartment, and authorities believe that drugs distributed by Barrero and Khleborod resulted in the deaths of at least two people and the serious bodily injury of a third.\nThe case was investigated by Special Agents with ICE-Homeland Security Investigations, Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST), the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office, the Greenville Police Department, and the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office.\nAssistant United States Attorney Andy Moorman, Deputy Criminal Chief for the Narcotics Division, prosecuted the case.\nCopyright 2018 WIS.

The tax agency demands in those letters that the recipients will divulge all of their involvement in the cryptocurrency market including all past transaction history and current holdings. People are being asked to list all exchange accounts and wallets they ever had and report their trade earnings. Additionally, the agency demands that people will reveal if they are engaged in mining.\nCheck Your Mailbox\nThe agency appears to be be very confident in its suspicions as some local tax offices have not even bothered with sending out the letters with demands for information, instead they just opened a business case for anyone they think is trading bitcoin.

Wired’s Pump And Dump\nThe fateful day for the publication came about in May 2013 after an experiment with mining Bitcoin on a desktop computer.\nWhile considering what to do with the funds they had collected from the process, the journalists concluded that “the world’s most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction.”\n“So we’re destroying the private key used by our Bitcoin (sic) wallet,” they decided. The journalists then fatefully added:\nThat leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity.\nThe funds linked to the public address provided in the original article currently total 13.35 BTC ($117,000). Lesson Learned (Again): Hodl\nWired’s failure to “hodl” provides a curious window into the mindset of many casual cryptocurrency experimenters at the time.\n“Naturally, our first impulse was to use the Bitcoins to replenish our old pal, Beer Robot, (San Francisco’s Pacific Brewing Laboratory said they’d sell us a keg for BTC 1.5),” the miners wrote on the topic of how to spend the funds. “But that didn’t pass the journalistic ethics sniff test.”\nWhen the private keys were lost forever, BTC/USD was averaging around $115 . Wired continued to receive mining payouts of around 0.02 BTC until the end of 2013.\nWhile the publication has yet to comment on the increasingly widely-circulating faux pas , its efforts still pale in comparison to the infamous Pizza Day episode from 2010.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Pizza Index , even as prices fall under $9,000 on May 11th, the cost of the original $41 order is currently $89,430,000 – or 10,000 BTC.\nWhat do you think about the Wired private key episode?

This time analysis depends largely on what’s known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim.\nAlso read: JP Morgan Chase Eats Humble Pie, Applies for Blockchain Patent Fundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions\nFundstrat’s head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.”\nCapex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated. Internal Fundstrat research document\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” Mr. Doctor continued. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.”\nIf a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent. A Rosy Immediate Future\nMost of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures.\nMr. Doctor further elaborated how “miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain’s Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model.\nSuch rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone.\nStill other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given. At press time, BTC price hovered around $8,500, down almost ten percent.\nWhat are your crypto price predictions?

Although few in number the country has customers of cryptocurrency, and in the with the rise of digital currency, the government is planning to adopt this trend.\nMohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, Chairman of the Economic Commission of the Parliament of Iran, strongly believes that a national digital currency is required in the war-stricken nation, and envisions that the world’s future economy would be based on cryptocurrencies. Sponsored Links\nPourebrahimi realizes that there is an outflow of huge amounts from the nation in the form of cryptocurrencies. As per a local news report, $2.5 billion has gone out of Iran in the form of bitcoin, as the digital currency is presently the only method to send money out of the country. However, Pourebrahimi feels that this particular cryptographic form of remittance is not transparent and lacks validation.\nTo tackle this issue, the Iranian government is toying with the idea of a national bank-issued cryptocurrency, backed by the nation’s most prized asset; oil.\nNot only would it put an end to the vast outflow of digital money, but it would also increase potential business opportunities for the nation. However, until the nation’s very own crypto is in place, the central bank of Iran has ceased all activities revolving around cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, the oil-backed cryptocurrency may not find favor with many countries, as was recently evidenced by the global backlash on Venezuela’s native oil-backed cryptocurrency – Petro. Adding her thoughts on the topic, is Priscilla Moriuchi, Director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future:\n“The petro will struggle to be exchangeable for hard currencies such as the dollar or the euro and this will limit its appeal to investors and users. Iran is likely to experience some of the same hurdles if it decides to create its own oil-backed cryptocurrency.”\nMoriuchi also expressed her dissatisfaction with bitcoin’s slow transactions times, which in turn leads to Bitcoin’s protocol being “more observable.” Additionally, she considers litecoin and monero as faster, safer alternatives.\nNevertheless, bitcoin remains a popular choice of remittances via cryptocurrency, and for many users, the only option. Speaking to Forbes , a person wishing to be unnamed, said:\n“With exchange offices closed, sanctions and the rial dropping like crazy it seems like a good idea to use Bitcoin. I know that there’s a few people selling and buying Bitcoin in Iran with LocalBitcoins.” Political Ongoings Cloud Iran’s Economy\nAll said and done, ever since the nuclear deal of 2015 was signed, a number of companies showed interest in doing business with Iran and conducting payments in bitcoin.\nHowever, there is a flipside to this, as Harry Colvin from Longview Economics says:\n“It’s unlikely that energy companies in the west or the developed world will want to use bitcoin on a large scale. It’s pretty easy for individuals to move money overseas via bitcoin, however, and I imagine that’s been happening.”\nOn March 26, 2018, Iran’s national currency stooped to a new low, and its value against the dollar dropped significantly. The faltering currency wasn’t the only drawback as a weak domestic economy, increased demand for the dollar, and local banks facing financial shortcomings made matters worse.\nAn initial struggle is inevitable in case Iran decides to go ahead with its oil-backed crypto, as exchanging it with currencies like the euro or dollar could present a barrier. This could limit its luster to potential investors.

It also publishes an ‎Android wallet, an iOS Wallet, a Bitcoin API, a block explorer and a mining pool‏.‏\nChina is unarguably the biggest cryptocurrency market in the world, but the government has ‎been escalating its clampdown on the sector. Additionally, local app stores must register with ‎the authorities as they sought to regulate the industry of app stores.‎\nAs such, the usage of Huawei’s new crypto features could be limited as the same apps on ‎Google Play store are banned in the country. Before that, Apple was also made to take down some of their ‎services from the Chinese market.‎\nEarlier in March, Huawei was reportedly on the verge of making a significant step towards ‎‎penetrating the blockchain space. Bloomberg said that the Chinese smartphone maker and ‎‎telecommunications giant is in talks to license SIRIN LABS’ operating ‎system and could reach ‎an agreement in the coming ‎weeks.\nCommenting on the news, Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei Mobile Services, said‏:‏‎‎‏“‏Cryptocurrencies have recently expanded the human understanding of digital economy at a ‎large scale…We expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the ‎near future‏.”‏\nHe added: “The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking ‎system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there. It’s a good ‎opportunity to tap into the Chinese market.”‎\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrencynewshuawei-reportedly-talks-sirin-labs-license-blockchain-os/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrencynewschina-scrutinizes-banks-e-payment-accounts-stamp-%E2%80%8Ecryptocurrency-trading/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin wallet app", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallet app", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blocktrail", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain ‎technologies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T00:24:32.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fc33048823009c47d166c559b5346a62fc59739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhH8knqPIfM2QX2LGrbjhrtc-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T20:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8fc33048823009c47d166c559b5346a62fc59739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhH8knqPIfM2QX2LGrbjhrtc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T20:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 11, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Miner Heist - From Iceland To China Cointelegraph All over the world miners have set up operations, big and small, as they look to capitalize on dwindling Bitcoin rewards from processing transactions ...

Huawei phone users will be in for a surprise when downloading the bitcoin wallet from the App Gallery, as BTC.com — which is owned by China-based cryptocurrency miner manufacturer Bitmain — is running a promotion in which it will “gift a starting amount of cryptocurrency.”\n“BTC.com is democratizing Bitcoin by breaking down barriers to entry and ensuring new users can access Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a simple, secure and trusted environment,” according to BTC.com’s Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of Business Operations, in a press release. Mobile Crypto Payments BTC.com is the first bitcoin wallet accepted into Huawei’s recently-launched app store.\nChina is a global leader in mobile payments with apps like WeChat and AliPay leading the way. But the government has taken a hard line on the cryptocurrency industry, as evidenced by its banning of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and local bitcoin exchanges from operating in the mainland, not to mention its crackdown on bitcoin mining, which is a feature on the BTC.com platform. Nonetheless, BTC.com’s de la Torre recognizes “the amazing opportunity cryptocurrencies have in replacing fiat currency as the currency of choice for mobile payments” in China. Huawei execs have a similarly ambitious view.\nHuawei and BTC.com couldn’t wait on the sidelines as more than 90% of China’s internet users go online via their mobile device.

Krista Kennell / Getty Images\n“Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani made numerous false and misleading statements in investor presentations, product demonstrations, and media articles by which they deceived investors into believing that its key product – a portable blood analyzer – could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood, revolutionizing the blood testing industry,” the SEC revealed in a statement.\n“In truth, Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could complete only a small number of tests, and the company conducted the vast majority of patient tests on modified and industry-standard commercial analyzers manufactured by others.”\nTheranos’ investor list read like a who’s-who of billionaires, including the Walton family, News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch, and New York Times owner Carlos Slim. I don’t know much about Carlos Slim and his politics, but this list is otherwise a group of the most politically conservative rich people around.

Except, of course, it was all a lie. Holmes’ revolutionary invention was a fraud and she turned out to be a scam artist.\nVenture capitalist Tim Draper was an early investor in Theranos who reportedly put up $500,000.

Sunshine Profits - May 11, 2018, 1:08 PM EDT SHARE ON:\nThe situation in the market has become one where Bitcoin is trading on relatively low volume without major moves. But the currency is in a very important place. Actually, Bitcoin is simmering slowly. Will it boil? Will this increase the profits on our hypothetical positions?\nThe Bitcoin market has its undeniable quirks. From the wild volatility of the currency, to a community of developers supporting it, to the fact that Bitcoin can be put in vaults. Putting Bitcoin in “cold vaults” usually means transferring the currency to a storage device without any access to the Internet or any outside networks. But sometimes Bitcoin is put in actual vaults. In an article on Bloomberg, we read :\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers — connected to nothing — that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\nIf this seems crazy, then maybe it is. A bit. On the other hand, if you have a sizable position in Bitcoin, then cold storage and, more specifically, an actual vault might be the way to go. This is mostly important for the insurance part of your portfolio . Even if don’t have access to services like Xapo, it might be a good idea to hold part of your coins in cold storage. A simplest idea would be an external USB stick or hard drive without connection to the Internet. The problem with this, of course, is that you have to keep track of where the drive is, unless you can put it in a safe location (e.g. an actual safe) and you have all the same problems you would normally have keeping large amounts of cash at home (risk of robbery, etc.) This is why other kinds of storage services might enjoy some interest in the future.\nEven if it’s not apparent at first sight, this has implications for Bitcoin traders and investors beyond the insurance part of one’s portfolio. For instance, the fact that 7% of the global Bitcoin supply is held at Xapo, and possibly more in other cold storage services, makes Bitcoin a bit more similar to gold, which has a similar curious characteristic that it’s mostly dug up from the ground only to be stored in vaults. Another implication which can be drawn from this is that it is the investment or speculative trading that determines the price of Bitcoin. In other words, for the time being, the fact that Bitcoin is used as a channel of payments or the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is fixed might not have a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin but rather an indirect impact of honing speculative moods. Bitcoin Tests Retracement and Fails\nOn BitStamp, we’re seeing the rally from around $7,000 to $9,000. It seems that the move lost momentum around $9,500 and the currency moved to $10,000 on relatively small volume. This is a bearish sign, albeit not a particularly strong one.\nBut we have a stronger one in the form of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This level is not a deal breaker, but it currently is the closest level which might have implications for the short-term. First of all, a move above this retracement could result in a short-term rally. This is not what we’re seeing now, though.\nWhat we have seen so far is a move above the 38.2% retracement on April 24, 2018, denied one day later, a repeat of the move up on May 3, 2018, and a repeat of the invalidation on May 7, 2018. If you count the move on April 29, 2018, then we have three tests of the 38.2% retracement, all of which failed. The fact that Bitcoin is testing this level relatively frequently suggests that it might be an important one and the failed moves up hint at a possible decline in the weeks to come. One More Factor Comes into Play\nOn the Bitfinex chart, we see that the recent rally brought Bitcoin around $10,000 but the currency stopped at that level. $10,000 is a psychologically important level, a resistance level at this time. The fact that $10,000 stopped the recent move is a bearish indication. But there is more than just $10,000 to the rally.\nGenerally, the rally from $7,000 to $10,000 is seen in proper perspective on the above chart. Bitcoin is above the 78.6% retracement level, which is a slightly bullish indication since this level is not a particularly important one. Perhaps more importantly, the 61.8% retracement level has not been touched and it still acts as a ceiling for the recent move. This is a bearish indication as not much has changed in the last couple of days.\nThere is one more factor that comes into play at the moment. It’s the support line based on the February and March lows. Bitcoin is now quite close to this level. If we see a move below, we might actually get an acceleration of the decline which has been simmering slowly for the last couple of days.\nSumming up, even thought we’re not seeing much volatility, a small move lower might trigger substantial declines, making the profits on our hypothetical grow even further.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/gold-investment-ideas/gold-portfolio/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-resistance-level/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-support/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/fibonacci-retracement/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:49:44.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a26f5603e58700bea277af5be25bfec9ce8fd0bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFU5NtqW0gjBbl_OzEHWN8kMJHUolYdR7QHBN8OaMXrZTruJF9MVTd52u73iyk_mzmnAL2gAnI_5olYWNfV767WdrmunuQPM7CEcWWmBNKOUf", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Report: Bitcoin money laundering suspect spared from prison poison plot", "title_full": "Report: Bitcoin money laundering suspect spared from prison poison plot", "published": "2018-05-11T20:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-860167160-760x380.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a26f5603e58700bea277af5be25bfec9ce8fd0bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFU5NtqW0gjBbl_OzEHWN8kMJHUolYdR7QHBN8OaMXrZTruJF9MVTd52u73iyk_mzmnAL2gAnI_5olYWNfV767WdrmunuQPM7CEcWWmBNKOUf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-11T20:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report: Bitcoin money laundering suspect spared from prison poison plot", "text": "Report: Bitcoin money laundering suspect spared from prison poison plot by 0\nCyrus Farivar– 5/11/2018, 9:05 AM Sputnik News, a Russian media outlet, quoted an anonymous source “familiar with the situation” that local criminals were plotting to poison the Russian suspect, Alexander Vinnik.

Wired’s Pump And Dump\nThe fateful day for the publication came about in May 2013 after an experiment with mining Bitcoin on a desktop computer.\nWhile considering what to do with the funds they had collected from the process, the journalists concluded that “the world’s most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction.”\n“So we’re destroying the private key used by our Bitcoin (sic) wallet,” they decided. The journalists then fatefully added:\nThat leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity.\nThe funds linked to the public address provided in the original article currently total 13.35 BTC ($117,000). Lesson Learned (Again): Hodl\nWired’s failure to “hodl” provides a curious window into the mindset of many casual cryptocurrency experimenters at the time.\n“Naturally, our first impulse was to use the Bitcoins to replenish our old pal, Beer Robot, (San Francisco’s Pacific Brewing Laboratory said they’d sell us a keg for BTC 1.5),” the miners wrote on the topic of how to spend the funds. “But that didn’t pass the journalistic ethics sniff test.”\nWhen the private keys were lost forever, BTC/USD was averaging around $115 . Wired continued to receive mining payouts of around 0.02 BTC until the end of 2013.\nWhile the publication has yet to comment on the increasingly widely-circulating faux pas , its efforts still pale in comparison to the infamous Pizza Day episode from 2010.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Pizza Index , even as prices fall under $9,000 on May 11th, the cost of the original $41 order is currently $89,430,000 – or 10,000 BTC.\nWhat do you think about the Wired private key episode?

But the currency is in a very important place. Actually, Bitcoin is simmering slowly. Will it boil? Will this increase the profits on our hypothetical positions?\nThe Bitcoin market has its undeniable quirks. From the wild volatility of the currency, to a community of developers supporting it, to the fact that Bitcoin can be put in vaults. Putting Bitcoin in “cold vaults” usually means transferring the currency to a storage device without any access to the Internet or any outside networks. But sometimes Bitcoin is put in actual vaults. In an article on Bloomberg, we read :\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady. Related: Record Breaking Year For Private Money Managers\nIf this seems crazy, then maybe it is. A bit. On the other hand, if you have a sizable position in Bitcoin, then cold storage and, more specifically, an actual vault might be the way to go. This is mostly important for the insurance part of your portfolio. Even if don’t have access to services like Xapo, it might be a good idea to hold part of your coins in cold storage. A simplest idea would be an external USB stick or hard drive without connection to the Internet. The problem with this, of course, is that you have to keep track of where the drive is, unless you can put it in a safe location (e.g. an actual safe) and you have all the same problems you would normally have keeping large amounts of cash at home (risk of robbery, etc.) This is why other kinds of storage services might enjoy some interest in the future.\nEven if it’s not apparent at first sight, this has implications for Bitcoin traders and investors beyond the insurance part of one’s portfolio. For instance, the fact that 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply is held at Xapo, and possibly more in other cold storage services, makes Bitcoin a bit more similar to gold, which has a similar curious characteristic that it’s mostly dug up from the ground only to be stored in vaults. Another implication which can be drawn from this is that it is the investment or speculative trading that determines the price of Bitcoin. In other words, for the time being, the fact that Bitcoin is used as a channel of payments or the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is fixed might not have a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin but rather an indirect impact of honing speculative moods.\nBitcoin Tests Retracement and Fails\n(Click to enlarge)On BitStamp, we’re seeing the rally from around $7,000 to $9,000. It seems that the move lost momentum around $9,500 and the currency moved to $10,000 on relatively small volume. This is a bearish sign, albeit not a particularly strong one.\nBut we have a stronger one in the form of the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level. This level is not a deal breaker, but it currently is the closest level which might have implications for the short-term. First of all, a move above this retracement could result in a short-term rally. This is not what we’re seeing now, though.\nWhat we have seen so far is a move above the 38.2 percent retracement on April 24, 2018, denied one day later, a repeat of the move up on May 3, 2018, and a repeat of the invalidation on May 7, 2018. If you count the move on April 29, 2018, then we have three tests of the 38.2 percent retracement, all of which failed. The fact that Bitcoin is testing this level relatively frequently suggests that it might be an important one and the failed moves up hint at a possible decline in the weeks to come.\nOne More Factor Comes into Play\n(Click to enlarge)\nOn the Bitfinex chart, we see that the recent rally brought Bitcoin around $10,000 but the currency stopped at that level. $10,000 is a psychologically important level, a resistance level at this time. The fact that $10,000 stopped the recent move is a bearish indication. But there is more than just $10,000 to the rally.\nGenerally, the rally from $7,000 to $10,000 is seen in proper perspective on the above chart. Bitcoin is above the 78.6 percent retracement level, which is a slightly bullish indication since this level is not a particularly important one. Perhaps more importantly, the 61.8 percent retracement level has not been touched and it still acts as a ceiling for the recent move. This is a bearish indication as not much has changed in the last couple of days.\nThere is one more factor that comes into play at the moment. It’s the support line based on the February and March lows. Bitcoin is now quite close to this level. If we see a move below, we might actually get an acceleration of the decline which has been simmering slowly for the last couple of days.\nSumming up, even though we’re not seeing much volatility, a small move lower might trigger substantial declines, making the profits on our hypothetical grow even further.\nBy Mike McAra via Sunshine Profits\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/fibonacci-retracement-gold-silver/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-support/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-resistance-level/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike mcara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:32:20.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ef8275e25dec9ba8164ace89b07cf3639bfd070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j6LLqMTd4knGqN8j4B05k.2DcQ4H389OWjN_J9il91BBWoW8Gi33mUBM7xB_rym14aeGCsKuvOFj1SyNsAcA4th3omQ3tzmAwCTk3yNMg0MUZr0_t_6pZ9z5VK95gEK2SYBUDB.4I53o-", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "IBM and European Parliament Representatives to Speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague", "title_full": "IBM and European Parliament Representatives to Speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague", "published": "2018-05-11T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logo-34.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ef8275e25dec9ba8164ace89b07cf3639bfd070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j6LLqMTd4knGqN8j4B05k.2DcQ4H389OWjN_J9il91BBWoW8Gi33mUBM7xB_rym14aeGCsKuvOFj1SyNsAcA4th3omQ3tzmAwCTk3yNMg0MUZr0_t_6pZ9z5VK95gEK2SYBUDB.4I53o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoinist", "published": "2018-05-11T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM and European Parliament Representatives to Speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague", "text": "IBM and European Parliament Representatives to Speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague May 11, 2018 96\nCryptocurrency regulation, AI tokens, and blockchain-based cyber security — it is only part of topics to be discussed at the fourth annual Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague scheduled for May 17.

Bitcoin inevitably could be graded based on transaction history. As soon as the US Fed adapts a \"Fedcoin\" system and we have the main sovereign coin with pure bitcoin coins, this could be worthwhile. The closer to the mining operation - or limited transaction history - would result in a coin that trades at a premium, assuming there was a system. After-all a clean BTC could mean it was never tainted, it was never a vehicle for black market payments. Grade A level to Grade D, or what have you. From this I see sorts of additions to the system, perhaps coupon redemption and distressed debt administration. - CH\nFrom Davis Polk: A possible future for bitcoin is one in which the old banknote lists return in 21st-century form—bitcoin from a particular address would be graded based on its transaction history and relative distance from flagged transactions or blacklisted addresses. For example, as generally described by JP Koning, Grade A bitcoin would be “fresh” bitcoin, purchased directly from a miner and would trade at a premium. Grade D bitcoin, meanwhile, may have passed through a blacklisted address and trade at a significant discount. In between are bitcoin that are not closely associated with a blacklisted address or that have been “cleaned” by passing through a bitcoin mixing service that makes tracing more difficult. Such grading schemes could easily become enormously complex given that bitcoin easily moves across borders, and various jurisdictions could have overlapping or inconsistent blacklists, tort laws, AML/KYC requirements, and laws particular to digital assets. This type of regime could lead to a market where any large bitcoin transaction would require a bespoke appraisal. Further, because bitcoin do not go out of circulation, bitcoin will “age,” becoming less valuable over time as each transaction makes it more likely that it will pass through a tainted address. All told, fungibility issues could easily become a substantial limiting factor on bitcoin’s usefulness as a currency.\nThank you:\n Davis Polk + Matt Levine @ Bloomberg ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jp koning", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:59:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78fc774574bd742a6969905d7aa676e41e8077ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_3ngY2n0FSAmzrKlaKSXOA3QZ2xGH0EdLZfs5pglIKDOtMNLkqPVPNE43W6N9pwGee28W8NZsA7yUHb9mf6Z2bsNcBCmyXynvy42RoXY8iAFJL1vr_BG5dpMOTJ4KxO2Jo4NwH6Y5xLGCPEGnjtMKRZU_2j9yz4E-", "site_full": "icymi.email", "site": "icymi.email", "site_section": "https://icymi.email", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "ICYMI.email", "title": "Bitcoin News Friday, May 11 New york, Member eva kaili, Huawei mobile services & more…", "title_full": "Bitcoin News Friday, May 11 New york, Member eva kaili, Huawei mobile services & more…", "published": "2018-05-11T19:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78fc774574bd742a6969905d7aa676e41e8077ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_3ngY2n0FSAmzrKlaKSXOA3QZ2xGH0EdLZfs5pglIKDOtMNLkqPVPNE43W6N9pwGee28W8NZsA7yUHb9mf6Z2bsNcBCmyXynvy42RoXY8iAFJL1vr_BG5dpMOTJ4KxO2Jo4NwH6Y5xLGCPEGnjtMKRZU_2j9yz4E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian", "published": "2018-05-11T19:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin News Friday, May 11 New york, Member eva kaili, Huawei mobile services & more…", "text": "\nWhat’s new?

First of all, the term is used to indicate both the token, a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital concept (sort of like a virtual IOU) and the protocol, a distributed network that maintains a ledger of balances of bitcoin the token. In this article I'm pretty much always referring to the bitcoin as a digital currency.\nOk, in summary, bitcoin is a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is created and held electronically: bitcoins aren't in fact printed, like dollars or euros, they're produced by computers all around the world, using free software.\nHere is the thing. All bitcoins are stored in the blockchain and there they always remain, distributed and immutable. People can of course own them. We normally use the term storing bitcoins in a wallet, but that's in principle wrong. Rather than actually holding your bitcoins, a wallet holds the private key that allows you to access your bitcoin address. Sure, if the wallet software is well designed, it will look as if your bitcoins are actually there, which makes using bitcoin more convenient and intuitive, but that's also the reason of such a misconception.\nI can make an analogy to help you figure out what I really mean. We can think about the blockchain as a distributed giant vault, where all the bitcoins are safely kept. Everybody can access this vault, you only need a terminal with a remote connection available. The bitcoins are in fact held inside separate safety boxes, labeled with an address (the public key). The only way to access the bitcoins, is to open the safety boxes. And there is only one way to open a box, by using a private key. And private keys are exactly the only things that you can actually store and keep safe. You cannot really store bitcoins, you can only own them, by knowing the private key that can unlock the safety box inside the vault (the bitcoin ledger). In fact even when we talk about lost bitcoins, we are really talking about missing/lost/stolen private keys: the bitcoins are still in the ledger, they go nowhere, they are just inaccessible.\nI really hope to have clarified this concept. I know, it doesn't seem much of a deal, anyway, considering that the majority of the people \"holding\" bitcoins, do that claiming that they believe in the technology behind them, I find logical to at least try to understand how this technology is really working.\nNeed a way to safely store your private keys? Well, personally I'm a big supporter (and of course user) of the Ledger Nano S. Ledger Nano S is a Bitcoin, Ethereum and Altcoins hardware wallet, based on robust safety features for storing cryptographic assets and securing digital payments. It connects to any computer (USB) and embeds a secure OLED display to double-check and confirm each transaction with a single tap on its side buttons. You can buy one directly from their official website . Do not trust any other source, definitely not Ebay.\nAny questions or considerations? Leave your comments below.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\nWidespread Losses\nEvery one of the top 25 digital currencies (ranked by total market value) was in the red at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nWhile Bitcoin had fallen 8.2% over the last 24 hours, several major cryptocurrencies had suffered losses close to twice that high.\nStellar, Cardano and EOS, for example, were all down at least 16%, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.\nRipple's XRP token and Bitcoin Cash, while not as far in the red, had dropped 12.8% and 13.8%, respectively.\nSouth Korea Leads The Decline\nSeveral analysts confirmed that the UPBit raid was the driving force behind today's crypto losses.\n\"T he main reason seems to be Upbit news,\" said digital currency investor Marius Rupsys.\n\"Most are talking about it and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop.\"\nThis isn't the first time that South Korean raids have caused crypto prices to fall, emphasized Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital .\n\" The last time South Korea raided their 'top exchanges' was on January 10th, and Bitcoin's spot price saw a -7% decline on intraday trading that day as well,\" he noted.\nHe added that:\nAs is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The Upbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow thicker skin.\nBitcoin Resilience\nBitcoin was able to hold up better than many other digital currencies because it is more established than its peers, claimed several analysts.\n\"BTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price,\" stated Shone Anstey, president and co-founder of Blockchain Intelligence Group .\n\"Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect.
