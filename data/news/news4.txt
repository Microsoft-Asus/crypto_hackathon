While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a \"virtual human agent.\"\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto\nBitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo Bitpanda , one of Europe's established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n\"Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,\" Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda's partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future.\nMicrosoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center One of Microsoft's data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands . Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that's an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world's population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. \"It's our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,\" a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users.\nTokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain A Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a \"Virtual Human Agent\" (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. \"That's a nice chair,\" the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating \"a world where devices act autonomously,\" an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a \"smart space\" by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

Most people assume this new form of money is something owned only by younger people. Moreover, there is a growing focus on quick flips and even quicker gains. A paradigm shift is taking place in terms of who owns Bitcoin, albeit that doesn’t have to be a bad thing per se. The Bitcoin Hodlers Still Exist\nThere are many different reasons why Bitcoin isn’t a major payment method yet. A lot of early investors are still holding on to their Bitcoin balance in the hopes of seeing the value going up. Late last year, such a major price spike occurred , which caused all kinds of consequences. For the Bitcoin holders, it was a validation of their strategy working first and foremost.\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin price has taken a massive dip throughout early 2018. For the average Bitcoin holder, that is not a positive development. There’s still a very good chance a new Bitcoin all-time high will be reached later this year or in 2019. Not everyone can wait for such a spike, though, as the current volatility makes it a lot easier to score quick profits – or losses.\nWhile there are still plenty of reasons to become a Bitcoin holder, the paradigm is shifting. During last year’s bull run, a lot of long-term holders decided to liquidate assets to those seeking short-term gains. While that is not exactly uncommon, it does show some of the initial belief in Bitcoin may be waning. At the same time, distributing the wealth to more people also indicates Bitcoin is still growing as a currency. The Bitcoin Short-term Speculators\nGiven the current Bitcoin price volatility, speculation has taken center stage again. Although that will only lead to even more volatility down the line, it also shows the interest in cryptocurrency isn’t waning in the slightest. Chainalysis data seems to confirm the average Bitcoin holder is changing. Not the person itself, but the overall mindset associated with speculating on Bitcoin in general.\nMore specifically, the number of long-term holders is virtually the same as short-term speculators. Although there is still a gap between the two sides in favor of long-term holders, that situation can change at any given moment. Whether or not that should be considered to be a bad thing, remains unclear at this time. A transfer of wealth is bound to take place sooner or later, as it is the natural evolution of financial markets.\nIn the short-term, the increasing liquidity of Bitcoin for trading can cause price declines. However, there is only so much volume to be bought up before the situation returns to normal. The coming months will be crucial for the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If the long-term faith remains elusive, things will not necessarily improve anytime soon. Nothing is set in stone at this point, and everything remains subject to change at all times.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ft.com/content/29259448-69b3-11e8-b6eb-4acfcfb08c11", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/14/befund-welcomes-daos-capital-backing-prepares-bfdt-crowdsale/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2017/12/08/bitcoin-price-market-value-boa/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:17:49.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e39368359d7a3dfa147ebe4a30dd32a2d9da6cf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz152RA49oDPzI1Fj7BJxfRA-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e39368359d7a3dfa147ebe4a30dd32a2d9da6cf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz152RA49oDPzI1Fj7BJxfRA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 8, 2018 NEWS What's Next For Bitcoin : $14000 Or $1600?

So we have step one in place.”\nSluymer did note that there are “plenty of technical bears out there” that are predicting price bottoms as low as $5,000 or $3,000, but Sluymer believes that Bitcoin will rally if it just gets through the $7,800 level.\nIn spite of the failed rally, Tom Lee stated in May that he still maintains his prediction of Bitcoin hitting $25,000 by the end of the year.\nBitcoin is currently trading at around $7,592 , down almost 1.5 percent over a 24 hour period to press time.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/fundstrats-lee-admits-poor-prediction-of-bitcoin-rally-still-expects-25k-price-by-year-end", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/07/bitcoin-is-bottoming-and-it-could-be-poised-for-a-breakout-ahead-according-to-a-top-technician.html?play=1", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tom-lee"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:33:19.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4913cf943c80aa5feb2f8c8cd501ed2ca8c02dc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSUKNW5coi1g2DHcxO_omPrLO3brBpQBJvcx0aiqmlTEooYq6SIUuUr5WJIPoxlBQBV0OcImryxyre079XoKUAR", "site_full": "www.ldsfreedomforum.com", "site": "ldsfreedomforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.ldsfreedomforum.com/feed.php?f=1&t=36873", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "LDS Freedom Forum", "title": "General Discussions • Re: Who knows about Bitcoin?", "title_full": "General Discussions • Re: Who knows about Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-08T17:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4913cf943c80aa5feb2f8c8cd501ed2ca8c02dc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSUKNW5coi1g2DHcxO_omPrLO3brBpQBJvcx0aiqmlTEooYq6SIUuUr5WJIPoxlBQBV0OcImryxyre079XoKUAR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dick", "published": "2018-06-08T17:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "General Discussions • Re: Who knows about Bitcoin?", "text": "2017 Dec 09, 10:10 am Definitely read all of this article. Charts and links at the link. If You Don't Own Any Bitcoin, Read This by Tyler Durden Dec 9, 2017 11:26 AM Authored by Adam Taggart via PeakProsperity.com, This week it hit $19,000. What's next? Wow. Just....wow. Bitcoin's price has gone 'beyond exponential' this week. Just yesterday, as I started working on this article, it shot up 22% -- from $14,000 to $17,000 (hitting an intraday high of over $19,000). And that's after a mind-blowing upwards rocket ride over the past several months. I think it's safe to say that the vicious melt-up in price over such a short timeframe has surpassed the expectations of even the starriest-eyed Bitcoin fanboys. The whole world, especially the 99.99% of us that own zero cryptocurrency, is asking: What happens next? And, What should I do? Is this insane trajectory going to continue for a lot longer? Do I need to get in now to avoid missing this once-in-lifetime fortune-making opportunity? Or is this a classic bubble blow-off top? Is this the deadliest time to enter, right before the price implodes? An Expert's Take I had the chance to ask these questions Wednesday to a long-time veteran in the digital currency space. We met at a gathering of online media 'mavens'; this guy has published news and analysis on cryptocurrencies since 2011, for both investors and developers. He knows the space exceedingly well. Unsurprisingly, he holds a lot of Bitcoin. I didn't ask directly how much; but knowing that he was covering the space back when Bitcoin traded in the single-dollars range, my conservative mental math quickly concluded he's probably worth more than most people I've met in my life. So here what I learned during my chat with him: He thinks the current price action is \"nuts\": To his veteran eye, the current frenzy is a speculative mania and will end in a massive sell-off, resulting in huge losses for those buying in at these prices. He's watched Bitcoin long enough to have seen it experience several 70%+ corrections. In his mind, this will simply be the latest one. And there will be more in the future, he predicts. But he's not worried in the long run: Like many longtime crypto investors, he sees a much higher price potential for Bitcoin. But to reach that level and sustain it will take years. The currency will need to be much more widely held among the general populace and used in a material percentage of transactions (i.e., not just being held by speculative investors). Until then, he expects lots of volatility (both up and down) of the sort we're seeing now. He admits that Bitcoin could lose out to a superior successor: When asked if the capital currently flowing into Bitcoin could flee for a better crypto 'mousetrap' in the future, he says \"sure\". Which is why he has diversified holdings across a number of cryptocurrencies and watches new entrants into the the space closely. But one advantage Bitcoin increasingly has over the rest of the crypto field is scale. He gave a highly-technical argument for how the blockchain actually has limited value without a platform to offer it sufficiently critical scale. \"Does Bitcoin offer that critical scale yet?\" I asked. \"Probably not yet\" he answered, \"But it's much closer to it than any other competitor at this time. And it's growing faster than the rest.\" Translation: Bitcoin is the odds-on winner at this point. He expects the world's central banks to criminalize the cryptocurrencies: We talked about the central banking cartel's longstanding monopoly of the money supply and its historic ruthlessness for squashing all competition. He agreed that the central banks would like nothing more than to replace the current cryptos as well as all paper fiat currencies with digital sovereign versions. And he predicts they will likely try to do exactly this. How successful will they be? Uncertain. He can certainly foresee a time when they ban ownership of Bitcoin and its brethren, criminalize transacting with them, and shut down the exchanges. Though while the cartel may be able to seriously curtail Bitcoin et al, he doesn't see it succeeding in driving them to extinction for several reasons. One he offered that I hadn't heard before (but have since verified) is that private investors have put a network of satellites up in space dedicated to making it possible to transact in Bitcoin anywhere on Earth even if the terrestrial networks are taken down by the authorities or natural disaster. His overall takeaway? Don't buy at today's prices; wait for a correction (it could be a really big one). But once it happens, buy in and hold, as he sees the price going much, much higher over the next decade. By the way, I'd share this guy's name with you but he asked me not to. Given how stratospheric Bitcoin has risen over the past year, he says his biggest priority right now is to fly under the radar and have as few people as possible be aware of his crypto holdings. Apparently this has recently become a real concern for Bitcoin investors who have suddenly become overnight multi-millionaires (Or hundred-millionaires. Or in the case of the Winklevoss twins, even billionaires). A vast windfall like this makes you an alluring target to criminals. Just one more unexpected consequence of this crypto mania we're watching play out in real time. The Peak Prosperity View The above expert's views match well with those of our team's outlook here at PeakProsperity.com. Charles Hugh Smith, who has been writing about Bitcoin for us since it traded below $600 has long had a price target of $17,000 -- which seemed unattainably high even just one short week ago. That underscores how insane the price moves of the past few days have been. With the $17,000 milestone hit so quickly, does he think a large correction could ensue? Very possibly. (I should make clear though, he remains quite bullish about Bitcoin's long-term future potential). Davefairtex, our resident charting expert, notes that his model now shows Bitcoin's level of overvaluation at \"nosebleed\" levels with a daily RSI of over 98 and the forecaster clearly predicting a reversal: And reader mrees999, our community's most-respected educator on the cryptocurrency space -- and one of the biggest advocates earlier in the year for buying Bitcoin -- offered the following words of caution yesterday: I probably wouldn't get in now. It's gotten irrational with FOMO. I'm selling into this rally and waiting for a massive correction once the bit shorts come in with the futures trading about to begin. (Again, I should point out that mrees999 remains robustly optimistic about Bitcoin's longer-term future price potential.) To the above, I'll simply add two additional pieces of data to show how quickly Bitcoin has outstripped any sort of rational justification for its recent price explosion. The first is this chart below, which shows how Bitcoin's price has blown above the maximum Fibonacci extension between its previous swing low and yesterday's swing high (note: this chart was created before the price continued higher to $19,000): (Source) And lastly, here's a table showing the accelerating compression of time it has been taking for Bitcoin to hit each new $1,000 price milestone: (Source) That right there, folks, is the madness of crowds. It's a FOMO-driven mania to make the South Sea Bubble blush. Advice For Those Who Missed The Rocket Ride So, if you've been feeling like the loser who missed the Bitcoin party bus, you've likely done yourself a favor by not buying in over the past few weeks. It is highly, highly likely for the reasons mentioned above that a painful downwards price correction is imminent. One that will end in tears for all the recent FOMO-driven panic buyers. To that point: as I'm finishing up this article, Bitcoin has retraced back to $15,100. That's a 21% loss in less than 24 hours for those who bought at yesterday's $19,000 high. If yesterday indeed proves to have been the blow-off top, that loss could get a lot uglier quickly. But even if it doesn't, what can those of us who don't currently hold any cryptocurrency do as we wait for the dust to settle here? Here's our current guidance: Open an account with a crypto exchange: While we maintain Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are in a bubble right now, we reiterate our position that they are worth having exposure to in your portfolio -- albeit not at today's prices. So, while waiting for (possibly much) lower prices after the inevitable blow-off top, you should open an account with a leading crypto exchange (like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex or Bitstamp), so that you'll be positioned to buy when the insanity is over. These exchanges require a fair amount of personal information that they use in account verification, and some of them take a surprising amount of time and effort to set up before your account is approved and/or funded to transact. So get all of that out of the way now, while your waiting on the sidelines. Build cash: We've been beating this drum for a while because it's not just Bitcoin that's in a bubble. As laid out in previous reports, nearly all financial assets are dangerously over-valued in today's financial markets. Keep building your cash reserves as \"dry powder\" to deploy when the next big market correction hits. Chances are likely that at some point in the next 0-2 years, you'll have the opportunity to buy cryptos, stocks, bonds and real estate at generous fractions of the prices seen today. Hold on to your precious metals: Holders of gold and silver have watched Bitcoin's moon-shot with a lot of understandable envy. This is the kind of massive re-pricing boom they expected the precious metals to experience as world fiat currencies inflate away their purchasing power. Were PM investors wrong? Did they pick the wrong horse in this race? Should they have piled into the cryptocurrencies instead? While it has been a painful five years, we expect precious metals holders will be rewarded in the end. Separate from the current emotion-driven FOMO blitzkreig, the reasons informed investors are buying Bitcoin have heavy overlap with the rationale for owning gold and silver. Capital will return to the PM market as soon as the current nested set of financial bubbles begins bursting. And if you think the jump in Bitcoin has been tremendous as a money tsunami has flooded into this small market, remember that Bitcoin's market capitalization is now substantially larger than that for all the world's above-ground silver. How high could we see silver go when that metal become en vogue again? Practice emotional resilience: Hey, Bitcoin could still rally higher from here -- much higher. It's still a small market with a lot of hot money fighting to enter it. How long the mania will last is unknowable -- we could be seeing the end of it right here (Bitcoin's price dropped below $15,000 as I wrote the last paragraph), or it could still go on for a lot longer than we can imagine. If it does, don't let the twin devils of fear and greed compel you to be one of the \"last fools\" to jump in before a correction takes hold (remember: that's how Isaac Newton lost his fortune in the South Sea bubble). And don't beat yourself up for not being one of the very few people to make millions from this craze. It's like being jealous of lottery winners. Instead, focus on the real wealth in your life (hint: it's much more than the money in your bank account), take time to appreciate what you have, and plan on sustainable ways -- instead of speculative ones -- to increase it. Those looking for some guidance on how to best do this can find our thoughts here. Don't Ignore The Revolution While we've made the case that Bitcoin's current run-up has been \"too far, too fast\" and a painful correction is highly likely, the new cryptocurrency era is a bona fide revolution. The underlying technology of the blockchain will transform industry and commerce on a similar scale as the Internet has. While we urge prudence and caution regarding the conditions under which you invest in the cryptos, we don't recommend you ignore their significance. Charles Hugh Smith has written several reports for us designed to demystify the digital currency space and help you understand the future value that the blockchain promises to unlock for society. If you feel you don't yet have a good grasp on all this, make his report Understanding The Cryptocurrency Boom your mandatory reading over the next few days. Written just a few short months ago, when Bitcoin was a mere $2,600(!), this publication and its excellent companion report, The Value Drivers Of Cryptocurrency, explain in layman's terms the real utility value of digital currencies and why a long-term view can justify prices that may ultimately be much higher than where they are today. Don't let ignorance or a sour-grapes frustration from missing out on the first big run make you blind to the revolution underway. Whether you participate in it or not, and at what price, is up to you. Just make sure your decisions are well-informed ones.

While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a \"virtual human agent.\"\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto\nBitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo Bitpanda , one of Europe's established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n\"Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,\" Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda's partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future.\nMicrosoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center One of Microsoft's data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands . Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that's an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world's population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. \"It's our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,\" a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users.\nTokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain A Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a \"Virtual Human Agent\" (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. \"That's a nice chair,\" the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating \"a world where devices act autonomously,\" an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a \"smart space\" by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

In fact, the country just passed a landmark law in April, dubbed the Payment and Services Act. This was due to numerous crypto-scandals and regulation crack-downs. The new law decisively recognized cryptocurrencies as a legitimate payment method, which is big news for the industry. Since that tipping point, Japan has been gradually easing regulations as part of a wider push to inspire more exchanges to clean up their act and cultivate compliant crypto-startups.\nIn light of this, we tapped into the CoinWatch Platform and News Sentiment feature, to gain some deeper insights into Japan’s latest crypto-developments.\nThe Market Status\nUsing CoinWatch we tracked the status of two top coins over the last week, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ripple ( XRP ). While the bears had sent its value plummeting to $7,118 on May 28, the coin is now trading back up at $7,714. Similarly, Ripple had plunged $0.55 on May 28, but has now soared back to $0.68.\nCoinbase Expands to the Japanese Market\nAs part of its strategy to \"accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency,\" leading digital exchange Coinbase has unveiled its first flagship office in Japan. This is to ensure \"buying and using Bitcoin is as easy as possible.\" As Bitcoin will now become more accessible to the Japanese market, the launch should provide big momentum for the coin.\nAmidst the recent scams and investigations, Coinbase has vowed to \"remain compliant with local laws and regulations.\" Coinbase assures that it has been working with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) and is laying the foundations to ease the transition and make the platform accessible, translatable and seamless to use.\nThe new push in Japan will be fronted by Nao Kitazawa, a Board member of the FinTech Association of Japan. Kitazawa will be in charge of a new in-country team and emphasized how the launch will lay a \"great foundation to successfully push into the largest cryptocurrency market in the world.\" It seems the new office is the first stop on the call for expansion, so time will tell if this leads to more developments for Coinbase throughout Japan and further afield into Asia.\nSBI Cryptocurrency Exchange Goes Live in Japan\nIn another big push for the industry, Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings has announced the launch of its brand new crypto exchange. Branded as 'VcTrade,' SBI Holdings officially announced \"the availability of the new virtual currency exchange\" earlier this week.

In fact, the country just passed a landmark law in April, dubbed the Payment and Services Act. This was due to numerous crypto-scandals and regulation crack-downs. The new law decisively recognized cryptocurrencies as a legitimate payment method, which is big news for the industry. Since that tipping point, Japan has been gradually easing regulations as part of a wider push to inspire more exchanges to clean up their act and cultivate compliant crypto-startups.\nIn light of this, we tapped into the CoinWatch Platform and News Sentiment feature, to gain some deeper insights into Japan’s latest crypto-developments.\nThe Market Status\nUsing CoinWatch we tracked the status of two top coins over the last week, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ripple ( XRP ). While the bears had sent its value plummeting to $7,118 on May 28, the coin is now trading back up at $7,714. Similarly, Ripple had plunged $0.55 on May 28, but has now soared back to $0.68.\nCoinbase Expands to the Japanese Market\nAs part of its strategy to \"accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency,\" leading digital exchange Coinbase has unveiled its first flagship office in Japan. This is to ensure \"buying and using Bitcoin is as easy as possible.\" As Bitcoin will now become more accessible to the Japanese market, the launch should provide big momentum for the coin.\nAmidst the recent scams and investigations, Coinbase has vowed to \"remain compliant with local laws and regulations.\" Coinbase assures that it has been working with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) and is laying the foundations to ease the transition and make the platform accessible, translatable and seamless to use.\nThe new push in Japan will be fronted by Nao Kitazawa, a Board member of the FinTech Association of Japan. Kitazawa will be in charge of a new in-country team and emphasized how the launch will lay a \"great foundation to successfully push into the largest cryptocurrency market in the world.\" It seems the new office is the first stop on the call for expansion, so time will tell if this leads to more developments for Coinbase throughout Japan and further afield into Asia.\nSBI Cryptocurrency Exchange Goes Live in Japan\nIn another big push for the industry, Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings has announced the launch of its brand new crypto exchange. Branded as 'VcTrade,' SBI Holdings officially announced \"the availability of the new virtual currency exchange\" earlier this week. The service has been piloted to 20,000 users so far, but the company plans to roll out the full launch for all customers next month.\nSBI also affirmed that the new exchange will have \"the industry’s narrowest spreads level\" and will handle the major virtual currencies \"first of all, we deal with XRP, [then] sequentially, bitcoin (BTC), [and] bitcoin cash (BCH).\" To coincide with the full launch next month, SBI Holdings also plans to scale its services to add two extra digital currencies.\nThe focus on Ripple (XRP) should be good news for the coin, and may be the result of a recent SBI partnership with Ripple. This led to the establishment of Ripple Asia , a company which uses Ripple technology to power cross-payment transfers for banks across Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Korea.\nThe new SBI exchange is the latest in a series of crypto ventures for the company.

But it appears hardly anyone is using it for its so-intended purpose. A new study by blockchain intelligence firm Chainanalysis suggests that most cryptocurrency enthusiasts still use BCH for investment purposes a lot more regularly than for transactions. Indeed, the amount of BCH held in wallets is 10 times higher than the amount of BCH used in transactions.

The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n“Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future. Microsoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center\nOne of Microsoft’s data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands . Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users. Tokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain\nA Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a “Virtual Human Agent” (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users.\nTokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain A Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a “Virtual Human Agent” (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a “virtual human agent.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Bitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo\nBitpanda , one of Europe’s established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n“Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future.

Since its inception, there have been numerous queries related to Bitcoin’s ability to scale effectively. At its core, Bitcoin is a crypto which exists within a network of computers, within the blockchain.\neToro currently boasts an extensive cryptocurrency offering, highlighted not just by Bitcoin but a range of other cryptos. With a diverse suite of cryptos on offer, the group presently supports access to all major coins and pairs and continues to grow.\nLast month, eToro made waves by announcing it would enter the US market with basket of ten cryptos. The US subsidiary of eToro will start with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Ethereum Classic, NEO, and EOS. Knowing what to trade\nBlockchain is a unique and groundbreaking ledger-recording technology. It makes the ledgers far harder to tamper with for a few reasons: The reality of what has is verified by the function of the majority, not by a single individual or third party. As the network is decentralized; it can be found computers on a global scale.\nThe key issue with the technology that is behind Bitcoin is the fact that it is rather slow. In comparison to even platforms such as PayPal and Bank transfers the speed of each transaction is at a very minimal pace. Visa is able to process around 1700 transactions every second, and its actual ability is at around 24,000. Bitcoin on the on the other hand is only able to process around 7 transactions every second. The gulf between the two is particularly evident based on this scale. Is Bitcoin Cash right for you?\nEnter Bitcoin Cash , the solution to the problem which has plagued Bitcoin. Originating as a fork of Bitcointhis new system looks to tackle the shortcomings which seem to occur due to the previous currency.\nFor a start, the key factor here is the fact that transaction fees on Bitcoin Cash are far lower than those on Bitcoin. The fees on Bitcoin normally can be as high as $1 a transaction, whereas Bitcoin Cash has fees of roughly $0.20 for every transaction. The transfer times of Bitcoin Cash are also faster in the sense that you do not need to wait for over 10 minutes to process a given transaction.\nOn top of this, Bitcoin Cash allows for the processing of more transactions at a given moment, which means that more people are able to use the currency at any moment. The reason that Bitcoin Cash is able to offer these advantages of Bitcoin is the fact that its block on the blokchain is eight times the size of that of a Bitcoin block. With this key advantage it would seem that Bitcoin Cash is likely to dominate in the future, however this may not be the case in actual fact.\nBecause Bitcoin Cash is a newer currency it is still trying to find its place in the market and where it can make a mark. Whilst its price and scalability advantages are clear, it simply does not have the same confidence and backing by those investing in it as Bitcoin.\nIn addition to this, miners do not make as much profit if they were to mine Bitcoin Cash, which makes them less likely to be involved in the mining of these blocks. Furthermore, there are far fewer trading pairs of BCH and BTC which makes it a little less attractive to global investors and makes it harder to be adopted by individuals who would like to trade in the currency.\nBitcoin offers the advantage in the sense that it is the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. On the whole, if Bitcoin is doing well other cryptos are more likely to be doing well too, and vice versa. Making up nearly 44.5 percent of the whole capital of the crypto sector, it is quite clearly the dominant player in this field. Its community and popularity is huge, and even those individuals who know little about cryptocurrency are likely to have at least heard of Bitcoin.\nAs such, while Bitcoin Cash offers the technological advantages over the former currency, it simply does not have the power and community confidence behind it. This does not mean it won’t change in the future, but for this moment at least, Bitcoin will maintain its popularity. With that being said, it’s probably not unfair to suggest that both the currencies are likely to be solid players in the crypto world for years to come.\nFor the casual investor it would even make sense to invest into both for different purposes. Bitcoin can be seen somewhat of a longer-term investment as its price is forecast to grow into the future. Bitcoin Cash on the other hand, can be more useful for transactions if one is using cryptos to purchase things or indeed trade other coins.\nInterested investors would be well served to tap eToro for access to cryptocurrencies, given their robust offering and reputation. The company has been working closely with regulators around blockchain and cryptocurrencies, making it one of the most trusted names on the market.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/interview/bitcoin-will-become-new-gold-standard-says-bladetec-managing-director/", "https://www.etoro.com/markets/bch?utm_medium=Media&utm_medium=Media&utm_source=50140&utm_source=50140&utm_content=0&utm_content=0&utm_serial=btvsbtc060618&utm_serial=&utm_campaign=btvsbtc060618&utm_campaign=&utm_term=&utm_term=", "https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/breaking-etoro-enters-us-market-offering-cryptocurrency-trading/", "https://www.etoro.com/markets/btc?utm_medium=Media&utm_medium=Media&utm_source=50140&utm_source=50140&utm_content=0&utm_content=0&utm_serial=btvsbtc060618&utm_serial=&utm_campaign=btvsbtc060618&utm_campaign=&utm_term=&utm_term="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:15:40.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "603dfe763592200c03d2884a0b241c60606de585", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJowkBbKhtVmyMZL6vj99CL4Y8fIEJZmlWnkyjzBNWxdJ.hIkw95l42_E75UHKwA5qcQPKXQuFgkEcwtaQGMhoolQPUn_Irar6_22EID0kwRZl1Bde_8EdXDcxfc.p0as-", "site_full": "www.gambling911.com", "site": "gambling911.com", "site_section": "http://gambling911.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Gambling911.com", "title": "Things Will Only Get Worse For Bitcoin Claims Analyst", "title_full": "Things Will Only Get Worse For Bitcoin Claims Analyst", "published": "2018-06-08T16:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "603dfe763592200c03d2884a0b241c60606de585", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJowkBbKhtVmyMZL6vj99CL4Y8fIEJZmlWnkyjzBNWxdJ.hIkw95l42_E75UHKwA5qcQPKXQuFgkEcwtaQGMhoolQPUn_Irar6_22EID0kwRZl1Bde_8EdXDcxfc.p0as-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Guest", "published": "2018-06-08T16:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Things Will Only Get Worse For Bitcoin Claims Analyst", "text": "Things Will Only Get Worse For Bitcoin Claims Analyst Written by: Published on: Jun/08/2018\n“This cryptocurrency had a very ugly May and it looks like things will only get worse,” said market analyst Jani Ziedins of Bitcoin in a Friday blog post.\n“This is a long-term downtrend and lower lows are still ahead of us.

While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a “virtual human agent.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Bitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo\nBitpanda , one of Europe’s established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n“Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future. Microsoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center\nOne of Microsoft’s data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands . Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users. Tokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain\nA Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a “Virtual Human Agent” (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain.

Venezuela experienced its first cryptocurrency boom in early 2017, when a record volume of 805 bitcoins exchanged in a week was set. Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange volume. Source: LocalBitcoins Following that, the level of interest towards crypto in Venezuela dropped, coinciding with a decline in trading volume to as low as 150 bitcoins bought per week. However, according to Criptonoticias, in early-to-mid 2018, Bitcoin investment surged once again in Venezuela, as evidenced by LocalBitcoins data . The volume of Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange increased by 138% from March to April, and by 39% more from April to May.\nThe first week of June was in line with this tren, Criptonoticias points out. Over the last week of May some 4.9 trillion bolivars were spent on bitcoins, while the first week of June had seen the volume grow by 40.8% to 6.9 trillion. Criptonoticias links the growing interest towards Bitcoin to hyperinflation in Venezuela. As bolivar keeps falling, in late May hyperinflation in the country surpassed 25,000%, according to Forbes . As per Similarweb , Venezuelans comprise the largest share of Localbitcoins’ audience, followed by visitors from the US and the UK.

Of course, the news excited investors, sending the stock screaming for the top in the market. Today, we’ll talk about: The news; what we’re seeing form DPW as a result; and what we’ll be watching for with regard to the stock ahead. DPW Announces News As mentioned above, DPW Holdings is having an incredibly strong start to the trading session in the pre-market hours this morning after announcing that it has used Bitcoin mined by its subsidiary to reduce debt. In a press release issued early this morning, the company announced that it used Bitcoin mined by its subsidiary, Super Crypto Mining, Inc, or SCM, to reduce the company’s debt. In the release, DPW said that this marks a milestone for the company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. Today, DPW made a payment of $500,000 toward debt that was acquired through the acquisition of Enertec by its subsidiary Coolisys technologies. This is overwhelmingly positive news as the company leveraged Bitcoin to make this payment, avoiding a dilutive transaction. In a statement, Milton “Todd” Ault III, CEO and Chairman at DPW had the following to offer:\nWe believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin… Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community. What We’re Seeing From The Stock As investors, one of th efirst lessons that we learn is that the news moves the market. In the case of DPW, the news proved to be overwhelmingly positive. Through the use of Bitcoin mined by its subsidiary, the company was able to pay a large chunk of debt in a way that’s good for not only the company and its management, but its shareholders. So, it’s no surprise that we’re seeing strong movement in the value of the stock as excitement hits investors. Of course, our partners at Trade Ideas were the first to alert us to the gains. Currently (8:51), DPW is trading at $0.78 per share after a gain of $0.13 per share or 19.74% thus far today. Stop wasting your time! Start finding winning trades in minutes with Trade Ideas ! What We’ll Be Watching For Ahead Moving forward, the CNA Finance team will continue to keep a close eye on DPW.

With these changes , ads for “Cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice)” will no longer be displayed in Google's ad network. Facebook had already banned cryptos and ICOs (initial coin offerings) from its platform in January.\nHow did the market react?\nAlmost all cryptocurrencies lost 10% to 20% in value during the 24 hours after the latest announcement. This includes all coins with the biggest market cap (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin) and also those that were expected to gain a lot of momentum in 2018 (NEO, IOTA, OmiseGO). Advertisement\nThis clearly shows one of the risks you take when trading with cryptocurrencies: It's an extremely volatile market, and depending on when you buy, you may experience considerable losses within a couple of days or even hours.\nOf course, the opposite situation has also occurred. At one point in 2017 the value for bitcoin soared more than 1,500% since the beginning of the year. People suddenly became millionaires, because they invested in Bitcoin at the right time — before the real hype started.\nI think we can all agree that trading cryptos is not for the faint of heart. Apart from extreme volatility, what are some of the other potential risks associated with dabbling in cryptocurrencies? Total Loss & Market Manipulation\nFirst, digital currencies can suddenly become worthless if investor interest dissipates. In fact, bitcoin discloses this warning in its FAQ . Even Deutsche Bank has listed a bitcoin crash as one of the risks to markets in 2018. Advertisement\nSome coin exchanges allow you to set stop-loss orders, which could be considered to help deal with that risk. With a stop-loss order, you automatically sell at a pre-determined lower price to avoid losing all your money. Unfortunately, there’s a problem with that strategy: market manipulation.\nUsing stop-loss orders is common practice in the stock market. For cryptocurrencies; however, they might not work as intended because the market is unregulated. Investors who hold large amounts of coins can easily manipulate the market by selling their coins with the goal to trigger the stop-losses. Afterward, they can simply repurchase their coins at a lower price and pocket the difference. Technical Issues\nIn November 2017 the Guardian published an article with the headline ''$300m in cryptocurrency' accidentally lost forever due to bug.” Author Alex Hern outlined that more than $300 million invested in Ether (Ethereum's coin) was locked up in a number of digital multi-signature wallets and later accidentally destroyed by a user in a series of bugs. Neither the coins nor the money could be recovered.\nIronically, a hacker did not cause this issue. It was a technical issue, and certainly not first time such an incident has occurred. Advertisement Hacker Attacks\nIt seems like the rise of cryptocurrencies was exactly what hackers have been waiting for all their lives.\nIn order to keep digital currency coins secure, they are encrypted, which makes a lot of sense. The problem is that a coin does not have your name written on it. The encrypted code identifies the currency itself, but not the owner. This means that whoever holds the code automatically becomes the owner, even if the code was stolen.\nAbove that, once an exchange or a digital wallet got hacked and all coins are gone, it's very hard or even impossible to retrieve them.\nThese are some of the attacks that have happened in the last years: Advertisement 2014: The world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, went into bankruptcy after being hacked with $460 million (approx. 740,000 Bitcoins) stolen. March 4, 2014: 12.3% of the BTC on Poloniex was stolen. Aug. 2, 2016: 119,756 Bitcoins were stolen from bitfinex due to a security breach. Jan. 27, 2018: Cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck (Tokyo) said that the day before a hacker had stolen about 58 billion yen ($532 million) worth of its holdings in NEM. Risks Associated with Coin Exchanges\nApart from getting hacked, these are some of the risks associated with coin exchanges: 1. They May Disappear\nGBL, a bitcoin exchange based in China, went offline for no apparent reason in November 2013. Later it became clear that GBL's operators ran off with $4.1 million worth in Bitcoin.\nAnother example for a coin exchange that simply disappeared is MyCoin, with $387 million stolen in investor funds. 2. They May Get Seized\nIn July 2017, Bitcoin exchange platform BTC-e was seized by the FBI due to money-laundering crimes. 3. They May Disable/Freeze Your Account\nThis has happened to Coinbase users. Impending Government Regulations\nIn theory, governments can make trading cryptocurrencies — such as bitcoin — illegal, which is the case in Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Bangladesh, Nepal and Macedonia, but that’s not set in stone. Investors should monitor the situation, because just as trading cryptocurrencies is dynamic, the regulations are as well.\nThe Chinese government has announced that it will eventually close down domestic coin exchanges. Investor Sentiment\nFor billionaire investor Mark Cuban , bitcoin's value “is a function of supply and demand. It doesn’t really do anything else.” Chances are that investor sentiment drops over time, as there are a number of altcoins that have many more purposes than peer-to-peer payments alone. Take Ethereum as an example. (Ethereum is an open software platform that uses blockchain technology to help develop and take advantage of decentralized applications. The bitcoin blockchain helps monitor ownership of digital currency (bitcoins), whereas the Ethereum blockchain supports the programming code of decentralized applications.) Or they bait crypto enthusiasts with lower transaction fees. Ponzi Schemes\nThe BitConnect token was priced at more than $400 before BitConnect shut down after being accused of running a Ponzi scheme.\nSince then the token price has plummeted: What Financial Authorities Say\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a not-for-profit organization authorized by Congress, aims to protect investors by making sure that the financial industry “operates fairly and honestly.”\nIn 2014 FINRA published an Investor Alert listing the risks that come with buying, selling and using cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin in particular. Apart from the fact that exchanges can be hacked and coins stolen, FINRA reminded investors that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender. If no business or individual accepts them for payment, they eventually become worthless. FINRA also warned of bitcoin-related scams.\nJay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stated in December 2017 that “to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC.”\nClayton also pointed out that if the trading activity happens on platforms outside the U.S., it may not be possible for regulators, such as the SEC, to pursue bad actors and recover stolen or lost investment funds.\nThe moral of the story: It’s important to understand that trading cryptocurrencies can be a high risk-reward game.

New Miner Initiative launched\nThe Community around Bitcoin, the Cash tries to make the little brother of the Bitcoins through Upgrades and aggressive Marketing becoming more and more attractive for the crypto market. Two large Bitcoin Cash Mining Pools have now approved the Initiative to eliminate transaction fees completely.\nBitcoin is Cash made with the last Update of the block size from 8 MB to 32 MB for attention. Continue to be organized by Antpool in mid-may, a Coinburn, the burn the in circulation Bitcoin to Cash and, thus, artificially the value of Bitcoin Cash should increase. The effects of this event were, however, rather marginal.\nIn order to improve the crypto-currency Bitcoin to Cash, and to make the crypto community tasty, there is a new Initiative from Bitcoin to Cash miners of the “Miner’s Choice” in the Mining-Pools to the transaction have determined swipe fees.\nTo the Initiative so far Coingeek and nChain, as well as ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com . The Mining Pool distribution within the Bitcoin Cash network looks at the time of writing as follows:\nThe proposal of the Miners Choice Initiative requires that two settings be adjusted in the Mining Software: The current “Dust Limit” of 564 Satoshis to be removed. Here, it should be able to perform his smallest transactions of one Satoshi. The Zero Mining Fee will be accepted in each of the mined Block.\nFor the time being, there should be a set number of free transactions in every mined Block that will accept them.\nThese measures are intended to support, according to Coingeek the growth and use of Bitcoin, Cash (freely translated):\nThe Removal of the “Dust limit” is fuelling the growth of the Bitcoin to Cash usage. If only 1 Satoshi can be sent in a single transaction, you can use the BCH Blockchain for many other purposes, and more options for users to create. Micro-payments can even be smaller, up to a Satoshi-payout amount with a Zero (or very small) fee.\nCraig Wright, chief developer at nChain, also for the implementation of this Plan and that you can remain competitive in the long term.\nHow quickly this Plan is implemented remains open. Nevertheless, it remains to be noted that, according to the messages of Coingeek four large Mining Pools, which together represent more than a quarter of the Bitcoin Cash Hashrate, have spoken in favour.\nThe price of Bitcoin Cash is at the time of writing in 931,97 Euro and moved within the last 24 easy to down with a rate decrease of -4,17% . With a market capitalization of just under 16 billion euros, Bitcoin Cash place 4 of the largest crypto evidenced currencies in the world.\nDisclaimer: trading crypto currencies carries a large financial risk and can result in total loss of the invested capital.

You are still going to learn something valuable by reading this article.\nHere’s a newsflash for you….\nBitcoin and gold or silver are not mutually exclusive. You can and probably should like them all. Or at least buy them all. I’ve been buying gold and silver for fifteen years. I’ve been buying bitcoin since it was $50 a coin. And I’m still buying both.\nBut it is interesting to see how triggered some people get when discussing bitcoin and precious metals. You’d think you were talking politics. The debates on which is better can get really vicious and or delusional.\nJim Rickards and Peter Schiff hate the bitcoin and love gold and silver.\nHunter Riley III and David Morgan love the gold, silver and bitcoin.\nI’m not exactly sure where Andy Schectman and the Miles Franklin team stand. Probably somewhere in the middle.\nI do know that they will gladly take your bitcoin and sell you some gold .\nEither way, I’m writing this article so I get the last word and here it is….\nRead it and weep, Rickards.\nStop wasting your time and tears.\nCryptocurrencies and precious metals are all here to stay and will become even more popular and expensive or valuable once the idiots in charge of our governments have too many plates to spin.\nSo….\nLearn to love them both.\nLearn how to buy them both.\nLearn how to safely and secretly store them both.\nAs always, please share this article on your Facebook or Twitter pages or send it to a friend because it helps me gain more smart readers like you.\nOk.\nNow let’s get into it….\nBULLETPROOF BITCOIN STORAGE SYSTEM\nAs you probably know, a bitcoin is not an actual coin, it is more like a sophisticated piece of computer code. And there are many different ways to store bitcoin on the internets, your computer, mobile phone or even a piece of paper.\nAnd since all of this bitcoin cryptocurrency stuff has something to do with computers and the internet, you know what that means, don’t you?\nIt means your bitcoin can usually be hacked!\nWell, your actual bitcoin can’t really be hacked, unless something known as a 51% attack happens, but you can be hacked and your bitcoin can be pretty easily stolen from you if you do not follow proper secure storage protocol.\nThere are many different ways to store your bitcoin.\nMost of the methods for storing bitcoin are referred to as using some type of “wallet”.\nTo be quick, you have the option of storing your bitcoin in a hot storage wallet or a cold storage wallet.\nWhen you keep your bitcoin in a hot wallet, you are keeping it in storage that is directly connected to the internet. Examples of a hot wallet are the Exodus.io software wallet or the Coinbase online exchange storage wallet. These are not “bad” wallets, I use both of these wallets for storage of crypto and bitcoin but I do not keep the bulk of my bitcoin stored in any kind of online or “hot” wallet as this leaves you vulnerable to third party risk, confiscation or a hack. Just consider hot wallets as your cryptocurrency checking account. Exodus happens to be my favorite wallet for my cryptocurrency checking account.\nSo where do I keep most of my bitcoin?\nIn a cold storage wallet.\nA cold storage wallet is an offline wallet that does not have an active connection to the internet.\nA cold storage wallet can be a “paper wallet” or a “hardware wallet”. A paper wallet is where you basically just print out your public and private bitcoin keys on to a piece of paper and store it in a safe with your gold and silver. A cold storage hardware wallet is more like a detachable USB drive that you can fit your billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in as easily as songs on your iphone.\nMy favorite cold storage hardware wallet is called a Trezor. This unique wallet does not have an active connection to the internet and never exposes your private keys to the internet which means that your bitcoin is safe from hackers and stays only in your possession. You can load billions of dollars worth of bitcoin onto this usb-like device and store it in a safe with all your gold and silver.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff", "https://www.milesfranklin.com/how-to-store-gold-silver-and-bitcoin-like-a-boss/", "https://www.milesfranklin.com/the-godl-hodl-how-to-buy-gold-with-bitcoin/", "https://twitter.com/JamesGRickards", "https://twitter.com/silverguru22"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miles franklin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T17:16:35.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e66f2a4aa5e4484881dcd85f256692b7b5f79f34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbs6lykHeZaPKEKYaxxG7pA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin will hit 25k by the end of this Year?", "title_full": "Bitcoin will hit 25k by the end of this Year?", "published": "2018-06-08T15:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.812, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e66f2a4aa5e4484881dcd85f256692b7b5f79f34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbs6lykHeZaPKEKYaxxG7pA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vlad230", "published": "2018-06-08T15:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will hit 25k by the end of this Year?", "text": "The stock analysis firm Trefis seems to have adjusted their predicted BTC price for the end of the year from $15,000 to $12,500.\nI think this is one of the first realistic predictions of bitcoin I have seen on the market\nUsually everybody either say BTC will be worthless or it will be tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nRead more about it here: https://cointelegraph.com/news/stock-analytics-firm-lowers-btc-year-end-price-prediction-by-nearly-17", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/stock-analytics-firm-lowers-btc-year-end-price-prediction-by-nearly-17"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:21:46.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8015f98e8c4cf45d3ac70f40252d4c876f7f159", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdgdsd9Zirh8WQXO1Z9abCW0-", "site_full": "siteownersforums.com", "site": "siteownersforums.com", "site_section": "http://siteownersforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=35", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Sell Traffic - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "published": "2018-06-08T15:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8015f98e8c4cf45d3ac70f40252d4c876f7f159", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdgdsd9Zirh8WQXO1Z9abCW0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HelenShuth", "published": "2018-06-08T15:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW perfect software for breaking any Captcha\n1.

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nBitcoin is more risky than bank investment, but

Venezuela experienced its first cryptocurrency boom in early 2017, when a record volume of 805 bitcoins exchanged in a week was set. Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange volume. Source: LocalBitcoins Following that, the level of interest towards crypto in Venezuela dropped, coinciding with a decline in trading volume to as low as 150 bitcoins bought per week. However, according to Criptonoticias, in early-to-mid 2018, Bitcoin investment surged once again in Venezuela, as evidenced by LocalBitcoins data . The volume of Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange increased by 138% from March to April, and by 39% more from April to May.\nThe first week of June was in line with this tren, Criptonoticias points out. Over the last week of May some 4.9 trillion bolivars were spent on bitcoins, while the first week of June had seen the volume grow by 40.8% to 6.9 trillion. Criptonoticias links the growing interest towards Bitcoin to hyperinflation in Venezuela. As bolivar keeps falling, in late May hyperinflation in the country surpassed 25,000%, according to Forbes . As per Similarweb , Venezuelans comprise the largest share of Localbitcoins’ audience, followed by visitors from the US and the UK.

The group is one of the premier financial institutions and has billions of dollars under management spread across stocks, options, and exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ).\nInterestingly, the group is no stranger to bitcoin trading , as reports suggest they have been operating a digital asset desk since 2015. Additionally, millions of dollars' worth of private cryptocurrency deals have been conducted.\nNotably, the firm is advancing its footprint in the sector and intends to expand its digital asset offering to over 500 clients globally.\nSusquehanna Trading Floor\n( Source : SIG )\nBitcoin Trading Picking up Steam The development is yet another feather in bitcoin's disruptive cap as the once-shunned asset class is now shaking up governments, regulators, banks, and trading institutions alike. Goldman Sachs, for example, also intends to open its bitcoin trading desk soon, while the NYSE's parent company announced plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.\nHowever, Susquehanna already has skin in the game and claims to have a \"lot more money\" backing its trading desk. One can only speculate the potential returns the firm may have reaped since 2015, a period which saw bitcoin's value increase by 21,900 percent.\nWhile bitcoin's volatility attracts traders and investors in the hopes of turning colossal profits, staunch supporters dislike the move citing that the peer-to-peer payment model is now reduced to a speculative vehicle. Bart Smith, head of cryptocurrencies at Susquehanna, explained:\n\"The firm believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, Bitcoin's best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily.\"\nThe comments may hold true until bitcoin's circulating supply reaches its peak in 2040 – when the last bitcoin is mined. Until then, the prices will be fully governed by supply, demand, and public sentiment.\nThe post Meet the Institutional Investor Quietly Investing in Bitcoins appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:23:52.078+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5550223b9a1c936562a48ca8bbe0df68e022d3bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaGgi_mlQuDWuuosgg9WAbBvm5UKWOLAQdvMHTIwun62s2Qffrk_dmIoAEELA0DXEqjy2VRDQpb0XdfG1_K7PhWT7Mz0YrDW8O", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Comparison of TIM with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Nano and Zilliqa.", "title_full": "Comparison of TIM with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Nano and Zilliqa. : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-08T15:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5550223b9a1c936562a48ca8bbe0df68e022d3bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaGgi_mlQuDWuuosgg9WAbBvm5UKWOLAQdvMHTIwun62s2Qffrk_dmIoAEELA0DXEqjy2VRDQpb0XdfG1_K7PhWT7Mz0YrDW8O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Clancap", "published": "2018-06-08T15:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Comparison of TIM with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Nano and Zilliqa.", "text": "submitted by /u/Clancap\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:04:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6274290787b5f8d8e0e5974439a7848375badef3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdk6D8AAUmi6xAUXcF_APiPs-", "site_full": "siteownersforums.com", "site": "siteownersforums.com", "site_section": "http://siteownersforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=13", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Cgi-perl - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "published": "2018-06-08T15:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6274290787b5f8d8e0e5974439a7848375badef3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdk6D8AAUmi6xAUXcF_APiPs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HelenShuth", "published": "2018-06-08T15:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW perfect software complex for SEO/SMM\nhttp://xrumersale.site/img/botmasterlabs_xevil3_en.png\n1.

But it appears hardly anyone is using it for its so-intended purpose.\nA new study by blockchain intelligence firm Chainanalysis suggests that most cryptocurrency enthusiasts still use BCH for investment purposes a lot more regularly than for transactions. Indeed, the amount of BCH held in wallets is 10 times higher than the amount of BCH used in transactions.\nIn comparison, the amount of Bitcoin held for investment is equal to the amount held for transactions and speculations.\nFor the purpose of the research, Chainalysis divided the total supply of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash into ‘ monetary aggregates ’ – or broad categories that measure the money supply in an economy – based on liquidity.\nThe four categories included speculative coins (which tend to be frequently moved between addresses in small amounts), service transactional coins (held by services such as cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity platforms to facilitate transactions), investment coins (held in large numbers in individual wallets for an extended period of time), and lost and unmined coins (which can’t be accessed by anyone).\nResearchers further studied Bitcoin Cash by dividing its money supply into the same aforementioned monetary aggregates — and found only 1.5 million BCH coins to be held for speculation and transactions, the rest being long-term investments.\nCoinalysis concludes that while the ratio for Bitcoin between transactions and investments is almost one to one, for Bitcoin it is 1:10. In other words, 90 percent of all Bitcoin Cash is hardly ever used for transactions.\nIt is also worth noting that these statistics have undergone some drastic changes since late last year.\nSince December 2017, a large number of investors have sold their Bitcoin in the market, leading to its increased use for transactions. For Bitcoin Cash, it seems to be the other way around. While up to 15 percent of BCH was with exchanges and other liquidity services in November 2017, it now seems to have moved on to large investors who are holding on to it.\nFor the record, Chainalysis is a blockchain research firm that investigates cryptocurrency money laundering, fraud, and compliance violations. The firm is most well-known for helping discover the Mt.Gox theft.\nThose interested can view the entire research and methodology on Chainalysis website here .

But it appears hardly anyone is using it for its so-intended purpose.\nA new study by blockchain intelligence firm Chainanalysis suggests that most cryptocurrency enthusiasts still use BCH for investment purposes a lot more regularly than for transactions. Indeed, the amount of BCH held in wallets is 10 times higher than the amount of BCH used in transactions.\nIn comparison, the amount of Bitcoin held for investment is equal to the amount held for transactions and speculations.\nFor the purpose of the research, Chainalysis divided the total supply of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash into ‘ monetary aggregates ’ – or broad categories that measure the money supply in an economy – based on liquidity.\nThe four categories included speculative coins (which tend to be frequently moved between addresses in small amounts), service transactional coins (held by services such as cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity platforms to facilitate transactions), investment coins (held in large numbers in individual wallets for an extended period of time), and lost and unmined coins (which can’t be accessed by anyone).\nResearchers further studied Bitcoin Cash by dividing its money supply into the same aforementioned monetary aggregates — and found only 1.5 million BCH coins to be held for speculation and transactions, the rest being long-term investments.\nCoinalysis concludes that while the ratio for Bitcoin between transactions and investments is almost one to one, for Bitcoin it is 1:10. In other words, 90 percent of all Bitcoin Cash is hardly ever used for transactions.\nIt is also worth noting that these statistics have undergone some drastic changes since late last year.\nSince December 2017, a large number of investors have sold their Bitcoin in the market, leading to its increased use for transactions. For Bitcoin Cash, it seems to be the other way around. While up to 15 percent of BCH was with exchanges and other liquidity services in November 2017, it now seems to have moved on to large investors who are holding on to it.\nFor the record, Chainalysis is a blockchain research firm that investigates cryptocurrency money laundering, fraud, and compliance violations. The firm is most well-known for helping discover the Mt.Gox theft.\nThose interested can view the entire research and methodology on Chainalysis website here .

A short-term support at $7,500, but $7,400 will continue offering stronger support.\nThe cryptocurrency market has undergone a revolution across the world. But something is quite evident is the fact the assets have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars in less than a decade. Significantly, 2017 was a very fruitful year in the history of digital assets where ICOs raked billions of shillings. The hype about the cryptos has not died down this year, however, fraud is also on the rise in the space. This year along, $1.1 billion in virtual currencies has been stolen.\nA cybersecurity firm, Carbon Black based in Massachusetts has said that stealing the crypto has been an easy task. Rick McElroy, the strategist at the firm said in a comment:\n“It’s surprising just how easy it is without any tech skill to commit cybercrimes like ransomware. It’s not always these large nefarious groups, it’s in anybody’s hands.” McElroy added “You just have to able to log in and be able to buy the thing, you can call customer support and they’ll give you tips.”\nA Tweet from Carbon Black Inc. reads:\n“In Today’s News: $1.1 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen this year, and it was apparently easy to do; Cryptocurrency theft malware is now an economy worth millions; & Cryptocurrencies spark cybercrime gold rush.”\nBitcoin price analysis\nBitcoin price is trading marginally above $7,500, while it is still trading below the multi-week descending trendline. There is a bearish trend in progress threatening to push for more declines. The bulls are battling for higher corrections but the 100 SMA if offering immediate resistance at $7,600. The short-term 50 SMA, on the other hand has crossed to the upper side of the 100 SMA to signal the heavy presence of selling pressure in the near term.

To detach this expert, right-click on the NYSE BitcoinIndx chart , choose Expert Advisor, and then choose Detach.\nDuring the past 10 bars, there have been 1 white candles and 0 black candles for a net of 1 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 1 white candles and 0 black candles for a net of 1 white candles.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nA rising window occurred (where the top of the previous shadow is below the bottom of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bullish trend. There have been 27 rising windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current rising window even more bullish.\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 91.9678. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a sell 2 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 44.06. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 48 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 20.

(NYSE American: DPW) (\"*DPW*\" or the \"*Company*\"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc., or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide. “We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault emphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.” *ABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.* Headquartered in Newport Beach, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE: DPW ) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc., or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company's debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel's largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide.\n\"We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin's value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,\" said Milton \"Todd\" Ault, III, the Company's CEO and Chairman.
