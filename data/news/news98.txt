Market dynamic and investor sentiments have changed substantially however in the past few months; cryptocurrency mania now seems to be cooling down – despite a much higher adaptation than ever before for blockchain technology.\nGoogle Trends, for instance, shows a vast and constant decline of public interest in Bitcoin and other emerging cryptocurrencies. This is mainly due to the massive level of volatility in cryptocurrency markets . The speculation based price movement has also erased trader’s interest. Bitcoin is Not a Reliable Saving Instrument, Study Shows\nThe BTC coin rose to an all-time high of $19,000 level at the beginning of the year before crashing to $6,000 on Feb 6. It continued the huge sideways moves in the following months. BTC price moved sharply higher earlier this month to around $9,900 before losing all the gains in last three consecutive weeks.\nThe study from UK’s Warwick Business School , which is ranked at the first spot in the Financial Times online MBA program in 2018, shows that cryptocurrencies are not reliable saving instruments, even in the short-term.\nThe demand is driven by past prices, or simple emotion, rather than by economic fundamentals, according to UK’s Warwick Business School findings. It’s like a Dot-Com Bubble\nSeveral researchers and market analysts are comparing Bitcoin and other digital currencies with the dot-com bubble. The only handful of internet companies had survived when the internet bubble burst in 2000. The study further reveals only a few cryptocurrencies will survive in the long-term, and it is difficult to tell which one would be the next Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

A Chance To Meet McAfee?\nIn a tweet from May 29th, the outspoken entrepreneur revealed what appeared to be prototypes for a series of banknotes. In the tweet, McAfee claims:\nNo hoax. The ‘McAfee Redemption Unit’ is real and coming in 26 days (June 23). The graphic is low res – don’t want to give much away yet. Printed on currency paper, holographs on both sides, serialized, linked to the blockchain, redeemable, convertible, collectible.\nThe series consists of seven denominations, each bearing a photograph of either McAfee himself or a well-known cryptocurrency industry figure: Bitcoin Foundation executive director Brock Pierce, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, or Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver.\nThe reverse features an identical message with instructions for the bearer to bring the note to an address in Mexico. The banknote reads:\nPresent your certificate. The redemption center will verify its authenticity and provide you with a date, time and location in the US where Mr. McAfee will meet with you for the allotted time. No hoax.

The main advantage of such a society is that people can agree and act together on different issues, and can solve more and bigger problems than individuals can do alone.\nSociety is based on consensus. Trade, diplomacy, finances — they all have this prerequisite of consensus. This has created a need for different mechanisms of governance to reach consensus. And with it, often, comes a lot of abuse, manipulations and rogue players.\nTo prevent different manipulations, we’ve had centralized institutions that gave us efficiency in reaching consensus and making decisions. The necessary tradeoff between democracy and efficiency is well known among the students of different modes of government.\nWhile different levels and models of centralized decision-making have lead us to sophisticated, functioning society, it has also lead to accumulation of power and resources in the hands of the few. In modern days, things like the Internet and cryptography have given us power to explore new models of reaching consensus.\nBlockchain is one of the modern inventions that’s supposed to enable us to reach consensus without centralization and trusted parties. It is, in its many incarnations, still in its baby stages, but we can safely say that if it delivers on just a part of its promises, it will help us have a more efficient society without the tradeoffs. Byzantine Fault Tolerance\nWhen we start designing (or imagining) decentralized institutions, decentralized organizations, we can reduce (in programmers’ terms) all the related logic and data structures down to voting and a ledger of decisions/votes.\nThe ideal of decentralization involves applications that are robust and have no single point of failure. No central authority, and yet, we should be able to guarantee the integrity of the ledger. For example, we need to know that our bank accounts, or vote results, or some online text, or the content of some online conversation, or some digital identity have not been tampered with.\nWithout central, trusted players, this can be hard.\nIn a decentralized, untrusted environment, we need to provide for cases of rogue players, who will try to manipulate the consensus. To simplify: everyone needs to have a vote, but no one should be able to cheat the system using their voting right.\nWhen a decentralized system — which consists of untrusted parties — is able to function when there are treacherous parties in its midst, we say it has Byzantine fault tolerance.\nIn cases of creating a decentralized financial system, or critical decision-making systems, incentives for cheating the system are huge, so these systems need to be bulletproof.\nCryptocurrency solutions of the recent years have addressed the “Byzantine generals problem” by various consensus mechanisms, combining cryptography and various game theory strategies. Consensus Mechanisms\nIn blockchain applications – and more narrowly, cryptocurrencies — different consensus mechanisms are, really, ways to solve the “rogue players” problem of trustless systems we outlined above — the Byzantine generals problem. These algorithms are different ways to deter the players from cheating the system. These players are usually known as nodes — computer systems with instances of the blockchain, or which validate new transactions and mine new blocks.\nConsensus mechanisms are devised to make it non-lucrative, or not worth the effort, to cheat the system.\nRead more about these mechanisms in this post. Ethereum Consensus Algorithms\nPerhaps the most mainstream consensus algorithm used today is PoW (Proof of Work). This algorithm stakes the integrity of the network on the difficulty required to solve hashing puzzles. The most basic explanation of BTC Proof of work is that a mining node takes transactions and tries to hash them together with a number — a nonce — so that the resulting hash begins with a predetermined number of zeros. The higher the number of beginning zeros, the higher the difficulty. Mining nodes try by brute force to find the smallest possible nonce that, hashed together with transactions in the block, satisfies a given condition.\nEthereum developers have made decentralization and democratization its goals — and therefore, in contrast to Bitcoin, ASIC resistance. This has resulted in using ETHASH, an algorithm which emphasizes the speed of manipulating memory, instead of raw computing power, and this gives some advantage to using graphic cards and reduces incentive of developing ASICS (application specific integrated circuits) — dedicated, specialized hardware developed specifically for the purpose of solving PoW problems in particular blockchains.\nThe other feature of Ethereum’s PoW is the Ghost Protocol, which is implemented to combat centralization by distributing rewards for orphaned blocks — blocks mined by miners who lost the race to create the next block first, but still mined a valid block.\n“Ghost” is short for Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree and is a rather complex way of addressing the issues we mentioned.\nProof of Work has many flaws. For the system to function, ideally, every node has to be able to verify the entirety of the blockchain transactions — meaning, it has to store and validate the entire blockchain history. As Ethereum’s Wiki says, Ethereum, like Bitcoin,\nsuffers from the flaw that every transaction needs to be processed by every node in the network.\nProof of Work is, further, extremely energy-inefficient, and with the enormous energy demands required just for the network to function, it becomes a big liability, and the network becomes fragile. Proof of Work also (even with ETHASH) still struggles with centralization trends, with miners pooling in their resources, and with network relying on these mining pools, and other infrastructure problems. Casper, the “Friendly Ghost”\nEthereum’s upcoming Serenity release plans to transition the Ethereum blockchain to the PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus protocol. This protocol is called Casper, because it implements or adapts many principles of Ghost PoW we mentioned. Currently, both Vitalik Buterin and Vlad Zamfir are working on this release, and many final details still haven’t been finally decided.\nThe essence of Casper is staking and betting. Validating nodes will stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency — let’s say 1000 ETH, or more — which will enable them to partake in validation of transactions and production of blocks. By eliminating the search for a solution to cryptographic puzzles, we can expect much bigger scalability of the network.\nValidating nodes will produce blocks and bet on validity of transactions. These transactions/blocks will then be verified by other nodes. If validating nodes place their bet on promoting some invalid transactions as valid — in other words, if the validating nodes try to cheat — they will forfeit their stake, along with their place in the validation process.\nThis approach of betting, and possibly losing the stake, is Ethereum’s way of addressing the Nothing at Stake Problem, which occurs when the best strategy for a validator is to support every possible version of blockchain history (of transactions) without risking anything. In other words, to demotivate miners to back fraudulent transactions.\nWithout this solution, if the miners only have prospects of getting rewards for backing any version of blockchain history — as the Ethereum’s PoS FAQ puts it —\nif all actors are narrowly economically rational, then even if there are no attackers, a blockchain may never reach consensus. If there is an attacker, then the attacker need only overpower altruistic nodes (who would exclusively stake on the original chain), and not rational nodes (who would stake on both the original chain and the attacker’s chain), in contrast to proof of work, where the attacker must overpower both altruists and rational nodes\nSo this is a way to ensure the integrity of the blockchain ledger and its transactions.\nWhen nodes have staked an amount like 1000+ ETH, their incentive is primarily to keep their stake. Having in mind that validating nodes are chosen randomly, so rogue players cannot be sure they will be able to overtake the validation process, this makes it very costly to even try to cheat the system.\nIn the future, the required stake may decrease, to allow for greater decentralization of the network. The Ethereum founders mentioned the possibility of it coming down to as low as 10 Ether with time. Advantages of Proof Of Stake\nIt’s energy efficient.\nSmaller incentives are needed to keep the network going, due to smaller costs of mining new blocks (both energy-wise and hardware-wise).\nReduced need for incentives solves, or reduces, a whole range of problems that need to be solved in PoW system, like difficulty adjustments, and generally reduces complexity of mechanisms needed to regulate the network.\nCompared to 51% attacks in PoW system, where the attackers don’t lose their main weapons of attack, their hardware, attackers who try to overtake the Ethereum network stand to lose the main source of their power — their stakes. Problems with PoS\nOne of the main problems that people point out regarding PoS is, again, a certain level of centralization, or “the rich get richer” problem. Rewards from the network will go only to those who already have a high amount of capital.\nDuring a recent conference in Curacao, VMware’s prominent distributed system’s expert Dahlia Malkhi pointed out these problems, emphasizing that it’s “giving power to people who have lots of money”.\nBut those with their eyes on the crypto industry for the last couple of years have seen their fair share of “whale games” and market manipulations even in those cryptocurrencies which boast by their different decentralization mechanisms. It’s hard to claim any mechanism will inherently secure fairness and efficiency and security and fault tolerance.\nSo perhaps being perfectionist here is unrealistic, and speculations about consequences of different design decisions aren’t always reliable. Besides, the rich get richer in PoW, too. In fact, it’s only possible to become an effective miner if you’re rich. In Ethereum, everyone will be able to be a “miner” in time. Conclusion\nWe still don’t know the final shape this Ethereum upgrade will take, and even its core developers don’t seem to be always on the same page about it. There are two versions that are being juggled around, but Serenity is coming, and with it both Casper and other improvements of the protocol that improve its scalability and efficiency. If it is rolled out with the “Constantinople” update — as is speculated — we could see Casper published by the end of 2018.

Moreover, Since December 2017 that the market cannot recover. During the last months Bitcoin has been traded between the $6,000 $10,000 range, and now important price movement was able to change that.\nBut what will happen during the rest of 2018? Some experts have been predicting very bullish Bitcoin behaviours, but some others believe that the cryptocurrency market will not skyrocket. Lower Crypto Market Capitalization\nDuring the last year we had an important bull run that moved Bitcoin prices up. The market capitalization and the price of virtual currencies couldn’t stop growing. Which was the roof? Nobody knew about it.\nAccording to Sean Williams, the market was primarily controlled by retail investors. Institutional traders were just a few, and these individual investors did not have possibilities to profit betting against digital currencies. The only option for them was to buy and sell at a higher price.\nSince the CME and the CBOE started to offer Bitcoin futures, the situation changed. During the last months, an important number of institutional investors is now in the market. These two platforms allow companies to easily place their bets in two different directions, up or down. Lower Bitcoin Price\nMr. Willians predicted at the beginning of the current year, that Bitcoin would lose at leas half of its value. And indeed, it moved from $14,100 to over $6,000. This is more than half of its value, and something that Williams believes that will happen again before 2019.\nHe explains that It is not clear what can produce this price movement. It can be important regulations taking place in the United States or South Korea, or another similar situation. Additionally, the entrance of institutional investors to the market may also cause the prices to drop. Bitcoin Hegemony Lost?\nCan Bitcoin lose the first position in the market? According to Mr. Williams, that’s something that is very possible. According to him, Bitcoin would temporarily lose its place as the largest virtual currency in the world.\nThe cryptocurrency that would be able to do that is Ethereum, which has been usually occupying the number 2 spot in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the largest open source blockchain initiative, has more than 500 organizations working on it. Additionally, the different features that Ethereum has may let it grow faster than Bitcoin. Stricter US Regulations\nIn December, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton, warned that a lot of the trading activities take place outside the U.S. something that would make it difficult, for the SEC to protect American investors. According to Williams, this was a call for regulations.\nAt the beginning of the year, tax regulations tightened when the IRS put its foot down on cryptocurrency tax evaders. Additionally, gains and losses would now have to be reported on federal income-tax returns.\nWilliams advises new investors to be careful and understand that this is a very different market. Compared to stocks, cryptocurrencies cannot be valuated. There are no balance sheets, income statements or reports. Additionally, he recommends to watch the market, analyse it and stay safely on the side-line.

That said, today’s decision marks a notable legal reference, since there are ongoing criminal cases in South Korea involving cryptocurrencies.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, prosecutors from the Incheon district filed a suit in December 2017 against a firm called Max Mining and 21 suspects in an alleged $250-million cryptocurrency mining fraud.\nMost recently, prosecutors in Seoul have also raided several local cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions of fraud and embezzlement , reportedly seizing assets for further investigation.\nGavel and Korean won image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

While the Japanese yen accounts for over 56 percent of Bitcoin volume, gumi believes that there is lack of understanding of Japan’s crypto market and the project’s leaders are keen to fill a void in the country that was also the first to legalize bitcoin.“We decided to create a fund that enables us to engage more directly with early-stage blockchain and cryptocurrency startups, in order to be more effective partners and have a real impact in the market,” Kunimitsu said, in a statement. ” Our team brings tremendous expertise in emerging technology, and with gumi Cryptos, we can truly partner with these companies as they achieve amazing results for all stakeholders.” For its portfolio companies, the gumi Cryptos fund offers a strategic venture capital investment partner with unique access to the Japan cryptocurrency market through its network of investors and management board.Matsumura is also a Venture Partner at BitBull Capital and an advisor at Arrington XRP Capital. “Having advised top global cryptocurrency startups alongside some of the best investors in the world, I’ve come to realize that all of them struggle to break into Japan, the largest cryptocurrency market in the world, said Matsumura. “I’m excited to join gumi and their well-respected network in Japan.” Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were \"a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction\".\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n\"It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it's mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.\"\nAnd that's where the havoc begins.\n\"People dive in because they don't want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.\"\nIn that regard, it wasn't surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n\"I think it's an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That's what a compulsive gambler wants.\" A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n\"It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It's a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.\"\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n\"It's relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don't know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it's relatively easy.\"\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n\"A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don't want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.\"\nThe situation \"just goes bad\" from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n\"They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don't realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.\"\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late.\n\"Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.\"\nThe moment of realisation was depressingly familiar.\n\"It's usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.\"\nCastle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew koubaridis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nottingham trent university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:03:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4b2fa2910b8b0b7abe44a7665b76f227b9691a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAps0_rVMXPah2Iad67sOGm9evdZ9FMLZM6JJaJlXVNEi9GhOBtgnQ3lTh01nAhjCRa6bQDDhVitXEQ--", "site_full": "mohdarafat.com", "site": "mohdarafat.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Silver struggling to rise.

This certainly proved to be the case overnight when cryptocurrencies started to rally just as equity markets started to tumble.\nWhich coins are performing best today?\nWhile the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been a strong performer and is up almost 6% since this time yesterday to US$7,542.70 per coin, its alt coin peers have been vastly outperforming the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has been a highlight with its 10.8% gain over the last 24 hours to US$579.28 per token. This strong gain lifted its market capitalisation to just under US$58 billion.\nWhilst this was impressive, the gains have been even stronger for both Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). These two popular alt coins are up 11.7% and 13.8%, respectively, during the period.\nElsewhere, the EOS (EOS) price is up 6.9% and the Litecoin (LTC) price has moved 8% higher.\nBut the strongest gainer in the top ten has been the Cardano (ADA) price. It is up a massive 20.3% over the last 24 hours to 21.3 U.S. cents.\nCardano appears to be rallying hard following the release of its 1.2 update today which is expected to broaden the coin’s appeal. This strong gain has just pipped the IOTA (MIOTA) price which has moved 20% higher during the period.\nFoolish takeaway\nWhile this strong move higher today has been exactly what the market needed after a couple of weeks of declines, it is still early days. I would suggest traders sit tight and wait to see what the market does next.\nIn the meantime, I'm looking at this next major tech investment opportunity .\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nAnd when a tech billionaire - several times over - speaks, it pays to listen.\nThis could be your chance to get in on the ground floor!\nClick here to discover a $19.9 trillion dollar idea -- hidden in plain sight!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Austrian regulators seem to think so.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: China Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters Unauthorized Alternative Investment Fund Management\nThe Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA), Austria’s integrated supervisory body, has announced that, by means of a procedural instruction, it prohibited the business model of Invia Gmbh, a Vienna-registered company offering financial services in conjunction with the mining of cryptocurrencies. This was done on the grounds of the FMA’s suspicion that the company was involved in the unauthorized management of an Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) as defined by the country’s relevant regulations.\nThe Regulators say that the venture was requested to cease the unauthorized business operation. Meanwhile, the procedure concerning this matter is still pending. Invia Gmbh is neither licensed by, nor supervised by, the FMA. The FMA adds that it has decided to communicate this information to the public after having received “a large number of inquiries from consumers.” “Mining 2.0”\nAccording to a promotional forum post from November 2017, Invia offers “Active Managed Mining”. In practice this means for clients that: “You do not have to decide for yourself which cryptocurrency is to be mined, this decides [SIC] the company and thus spares the most lucrative coin. You receive your payment in Ethereum or Bitcoin currency. The company lets a software play in the background, this software decides within 1 minute which coin is lucrative and turns around. This unique piece of software serves as a hardware control, aligning it with the ‘most profitable’ crypto currency [SIC] available at any given time. The minted Coin is then converted to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Thanks to this software, it is possible to produce more coins overall.”\nThis type of service is hardly new, as many cryptocurrency mining pools and clouds, as well as just software solutions, have been offering the same for years now. It is possible that by promoting the company to newbies in the field Invia triggered the FMA, which didn’t notice other services before.\nShould active managed mining be considered similar to management of an investment fund, requiring an authorization?

Search for: 30th May 2018 By Wolf Bergmann 0 Comments NASDAQ teams up with Gemini exchange for crypto support\nOne of the largest stock exchanges in the US, NASDAQ, has announced support for Bitcoin BTC, Litecoin LTC, and Stellar Lumens XLM.\nNASDAQ will make its debut into the cryptocurrencies market with additional future plans to set up a new cryptocurrency exchange of its own.\nAccording to NASDAQ CEO, Adena Friedman, development of their new digital assets platform is already underway.\nFriedman didn’t reveal any timelines for a release date, however.\nThis level of support from the upper echelons of the financial institution will undoubtedly bring positive change to the crypto market. The Winklevoss effect\nNASDAQ is teaming up with the Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini exchange to dip their toes into the cryptosphere.\nGemini is the first licensed exchange platform in the United States, which is an obvious draw for the 47-year-old stock exchange .\nThe partnership will allow Gemini to utilize NASDAQ’s tools and technologies to augment security and monitor trade activities in real-time.\nThe stock exchange will back the digital currencies whilst working on developing their own cryptocurrencies exchange platform. Good news for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Stellar\nStellar Lumens (XLM) has remained fairly consistent in a turbulent market over the last week.\nStaying steady in the current climate has been mainly thanks to news of collaborations with big firms like IBM and Kin Foundation among others.\nStellar is currently the 8th largest crypto with a market cap of around $5 billion, according to the live price charts . SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE NEWSLETTER\nThe world’s 6th largest crypto, Litecoin (LTC) is also to be backed by NASDAQ.\nFounded by ex-Google and Coinbase developer Charlie Lee , Litecoin is the result of a fork from Bitcoin.\nThe coin is popular for its faster processing speeds and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin.\nBacking for Bitcoin from NASDAQ is also no surprise.\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is also the oldest and most widely supported digital asset available.\nWith a market capitalization of around $125 billion at time of press, no other virtual currency even comes close to its size or dominance of the space.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but downsides remain supported above $950.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bullish zone above $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to gather pace above $1,040 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent support formed around the $870 level in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move and traded above the $900 resistance level. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,010 high to $870 low. During the upside move, the price also managed to clear a major barrier near $950.\nA break above the stated $950 resistance is a positive sign for buyers. More importantly, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent high was around $1,030 and the price is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high.\nLooking at the chart , the previous resistance near $950 is likely to act as a strong support. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high is near $950 to provide support.\nLooking at the technical indicators :\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently near the 65 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:52:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d4c1848b273751d993c3bb15c1d66a1b2e5d732", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R8DYsyTkd1NDvwXP02cGvm0g7MBNmIjO1CGiJDm4_DTzCCo0nQbbGpa63PuBcvfeowtT_LDKA5A5Uuk98QvjCWc", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $7500, Still Early for a Bull Run – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $7500, Still Early for a Bull Run – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.07, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d4c1848b273751d993c3bb15c1d66a1b2e5d732", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R8DYsyTkd1NDvwXP02cGvm0g7MBNmIjO1CGiJDm4_DTzCCo0nQbbGpa63PuBcvfeowtT_LDKA5A5Uuk98QvjCWc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $7500, Still Early for a Bull Run – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $7500, Still Early for a Bull Run The bitcoin price has increased by around 6.5 percent since its dip to $7,040 on May 30, stabilising in the $7,500 region.

Italy’s economy is reeling amid a political crisis that has placed a spotlight on the cracks in the EU’s economic foundation. Bitcoin Price Trends up as Italy’s Economy Falters\nItalian bonds are going bust, and the negativity has spilled over into stocks as well. But as the global financial markets are reeling, bitcoin is finally beginning to see the light of day again, and it could just have something to do with the fact that a potential threat to the euro highlights the benefits of a decentralized currency like bitcoin.\nThe bitcoin price is currently trading above the $7,400 threshold after falling to a May low earlier in the day. Bitcoin Price Chart Reason to Rally\nThe cryptocurrency markets have been searching for a reason to rally, and many of us have been looking to the centralized governments of the world to provide that catalyst.\nMeanwhile, the mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets are working just fine, and have pulled off a rally — albeit on modest trading volume — on a development that highlights the very strengths of a decentralized world. Bitcoin and its altcoin peers have proven once again the power of a digital currency that is not controlled by the central bank but instead the masses.\nThe crisis in Italy has placed a great deal of pressure on the euro, sending Europe’s common currency to its lowest levels against the USD in months. Italian bonds have similarly sold off amid the possibility of Europe’s third-largest economy staging a Brexit of its own. A decentralized currency like bitcoin becomes even more attractive when the common currency of Europe becomes unstable .\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee cheered the crypto market’s response, telling Business Insider :\n“To an extent, I think its good to see Bitcoin rallying with Gold, as the adverse developments in Italy and globally are pushing investors to risk-off. It’s good to see Bitcoin as an uncorrelated trade on a risk off day.”\nTake the Latin American economy of Venezuela as an example. While the economic conditions in Venezuela are specific to the region, comprised of hyperinflation, food crisis and a broke government, the end result is a currency whose value has been destroyed. As a result, Venezuela’s currency was being exchanged for bitcoin at a record pace in mid-April, when more than $1 million in “bolivar-to-bitcoin” conversions occurred in a single day.\nItaly’s fate in the EU has yet to unfold, and a snap election appears to be taking shape for the coming months there. In the meantime, it’s not just bitcoin that’s benefitting. Other leading digital currencies including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin were all trading between 2%-4% higher while cardano soared nearly 10%.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:26:02.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "380e5b734f578f317549e30a27202fd67200e7c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacbICU05TDm8Rqur1AXPZibedpOChdLoLe57jTEY0e9ZxwOhDbYAYTgPsHHi.QdHPGBrK3gH1ZkZo-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "The Beginner’s Guide To Bitcoin In Nigeria: A Bitcoin FAQ - (1)", "title_full": "The Beginner’s Guide To Bitcoin In Nigeria: A Bitcoin FAQ - Business (1) - Nigeria", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.278, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "380e5b734f578f317549e30a27202fd67200e7c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacbICU05TDm8Rqur1AXPZibedpOChdLoLe57jTEY0e9ZxwOhDbYAYTgPsHHi.QdHPGBrK3gH1ZkZo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "supergist1", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Beginner’s Guide To Bitcoin In Nigeria: A Bitcoin FAQ - (1)", "text": "Buying of Bitcoin is has been made easies here in supergis we will tell you how you can buy Bitcoin from a very save source.

Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.\nHere’s ten reasons why Essentia has the potential to break the internet of fragmentation and propel us towards mainstream blockchain adoption.\n1: Essentia is not just an application or a simple platform, it’s a protocol. Essentia does front itself with a user-friendly interface to navigate across multiple blockchains and decentralized apps. But its open-source code also means that developers can tuck into the back end and create customized experiences, for anyone to use.\n2: Essentia automates the unnecessary digital admin, meaning you can get back to working on what really matters. Buying or selling crypto/assets? Simply set the value parameters to your preferred prices and Essentia will scan over your exchanges. By doing all the manual work instantly, Essentia ensures you get the best value.\n3: Essentia is creating two brand new application classes, cross-chain apps (cApps) and multi-chain apps (mApps). As we have all begun to realize the world of blockchains are painfully fragmented. The lack of integration is exactly what Essentia has aimed to eliminate, with this new protocol, decentralized apps can function across chains and work simultaneously on multiple chains.\n4: As a personalized operating system, Essentia allows us to interact with the new decentralized Internet. It’s like a bridge between the past and the future. For newcomers and tech experts alike, accessing and managing the web of decentralized entities has never been easier. Essentia can be thought of as a customizable OS which enables us to transport our data from centralized platforms to infinitely more secure decentralized services.\n5: Essentia cannot own or access your personal data, nor will the (de)centralized services you use. Imagine no centralization, it’s easy if you try. No data thieves below us, above us only sky… Doesn’t really flow, but you get the gist. There is no supreme commander with access to swathes of personal data. Everything done within Essentia remains completely in the users’ hands, we can thank blockchain technology for that.\n6: Essentia automatically interoperates with DApps in their native token, you’ll never need to carry multiple tokens again. Requiring a single token for each DApp you use is incredibly unpractical considering the time and cost in acquiring them. The ESS token may be the last token you ever have to obtain, that’s because it enables you to access your favourite decentralized services in one. How convenient!\n7: On top of Essentia you can build applications in whatever language you want. Essentia is language agnostic. We wanted to make sure any developer around the world has the ability to use Essentia as their tool to create next generation blockchain based decentralized facilities. It’s a way of ensuring we build this community together, spread the blockchain love and speed towards mainstream adoption.\n8: Essentia has integrated the best of the best applications, so you can natively interact with one convenient point of access. One seed to access your digital life, in its entirety or just sections. Our hard work partnering with and integrating the next best apps and services means it’s finally possible to have your entire crypto life secure and accessible only to you, from anywhere in the world.\n9: Decentralized passwordless logins. It has finally become a possibility! Forget insecure passwords that are likely to be forgotten and vulnerable to be hacked. Essentia has adopted state of the art eLogin technology to ensure your accounts are only accessible to you.\n10: Important for us investors out there — buy-sell crypto instantly. Ever checked the price of crypto then gone onto your exchange and it’s already changed for the worse? Never miss out on a good deal again. Not only can you automate the process but you could even use Amazon Alexa to voice command trades across the various exchanges to get the best price. Not a single button needs to be pressed!\nThe extent of possibilities is by no means limited to ten examples, but we can already see why investors are getting excited about the upcoming ICO. The private sale recently closed which reached the hard cap of over $20m and offers for over $70m. It’s not too late to register in the whitelist so head over to Essentia.one and have a look around!\nTo be a part of their growing community join their Telegram channel https://t.me/essentia_one/ .\nContact Email Address www.essentia.one\nThis is a paid press release.

BoE Studies Risks and Benefits of Central Bank-Issued Digital Currency The BoE has been researching how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would work in practice. It authored a research paper which claimed an important ‘step forward’ in the design of a currency. Accordingly, it stated that it would not leave commercial bank vulnerable — a not unwarranted fear, as many in the crypto space believe that digital currencies will help free people from the massive powers central banks have over consumers. As of now, unlike Sweden’s Riksbank , the BoE is not currently planning to issue its own digital currency, though it has discussed the possibility of doing so . The research was authored by Michael Kumhof, a former Stanford University economics professor, who works as senior research advisor in the BoE’s research hub, and Claire Noone, a Reserve Bank of Australia official, who works in the BoE’s note operations division. The officials set out ‘four core design principles’ for a CBDC which would avoid the possibility of destroying the banking sector, a major concern raised by previous BoE research. “A CBDC that is a close – but not perfect – substitute for bank deposits may strengthen the transmission of monetary policy changes to the real economy,” say BoE researchers Jack Meaning and Ben Dyson, who summarized the research . The research on monetary policy transmission shows that a digital currency which pays interest on balances, alongside offering payment services, would allow the BoE to gain greater control over monetary policy. “With careful design choices, a CBDC need not be disruptive to the conduct of monetary policy,” the researchers wrote. Because of the volatility associated with digital currencies, to make it work traditional banks would be forced to react more quickly than they do currently to raise or lower interest rates to avoid losing money. The authors said: “This would result in an increase in both the strength and speed of pass-through from the policy rate to these other interest rates, especially as technology and regulatory changes make it easier to switch balances from one account to another.” Furthermore, according to the researchers, a CBDC would remove the need for banks as an intermediary for buying the government bonds used in quantitative easing — asset purchases used by central banks intended to stimulate demand when interest rates cannot fall any further. Last week, BoE governor Mark Carney said he was open-minded about the possibility of introducing a central bank currency. He has, however, also criticized the cryptocurrencies currently available, even going as far as to say that Bitcoin had ‘failed’ as a currency. Going forward, Kumhof and Noone acknowledge that ‘risks remain,’ and that central bank digital money could still potentially impact the stability of bank deposits and bank profitability. As noted above, this apprehension doesn’t come as a surprise. Banks like the BoE, headed by bankers looking after their own pocketbooks, are beginning to recognize the transformative powers offered by digital currencies to consumers across the globe, but are at the same time worried about what their roles will be moving forward. “If designed badly, CBDC presents major risks to financial stability,” they warned.

the bitcoin industry is changing, and it could have greater ramifications if prices continue to track lower.\n\"Historically, miners have been true believers and supporters of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies--choosing to take profits in manageable chunks or holding off on selling coins to support prices,\" wrote Thejas Nalval, portfolio director, and Kevin Lu, director of quantitative research, at Element Asset Management. \"However, the world of mining has changed from one made up of evangelists to one where large-scale facilities reign, making fluctuations in price more deadly.\"\nThe folks at Element estimate that break-even levels for mining bitcoin range from $6,000 to $8,600, meaning prices may be approaching levels where miners might have to sell holdings to sustain their operations.\nAccording to a May report from Elite Fixtures, the cost to mine a single bitcoin in the U.S. is $4,758, $8,723 in Japan and $26,170 in South Korea.\nRead:Here's how much it

Yet he said the money wasn't received on their part. He told me I will get reimbursed and to come back the next day to buy the product.\nThen I received an email from BitFlyer telling me they will reimburse me the money as soon as they confirm it was received on their part. By that time, the transaction was already confirmed hundreds times on the blockchain, and the Address I sent it to already spent it. They asked me to create an account on BitFlyer so I can get my money back. I did create an account on their website. Then one week later they write to me, telling me they can confirm they received my money, but it will take time to get my reimbursement. Now it's been three weeks and haven't received a word from them.\nI am very pissed by this. They just took me 300 dollars worth of bitcoin and claimed the transaction never happenned. Bic Camera do not want to deal with the issue as they pretend I am not their customer. I do not care what process they use behind the counter nor what exchange they deal with. They advertise they accept Bitcoin and yet whoever is in charge of the address they gave to me stole my money.\nThe problem isn't with Bitcoin per say. The problem is 'regulated' or 'official' companies that pretend to accept bitcoin but in the end fraud its customers. As my BTC is already lost and I still have no access to customer support, I have nowhere to let people know about the fraud, except here.\nSo there it is.

The FBI was puzzled about the elusive yet polite robber who approached tellers saying, “Put the money on the counter…” and walked away with thousands in cash in a clear plastic bag.\nUpon his sudden arrest, the shocking truth was revealed when this criminal mastermind who outwitted authorities turned out to be an eighteen-year-old white kid from the Hispanic gang-filled streets.\nWith his “degree in business” from one of California’s finest “correctional” institutions where he was given a free ride in their eight-year program (with a seven-month sabbatical in solitude), he’s graduated from robbing banks to stacking Bitcoin as a legit entrepreneur and shares a vital message: People can change.\nToday, Stanley is a successful entrepreneur, in business in the adult marketing world, and a daytrader in cryptocurrency.\nStanley did his time in Donovan, a rough Southern California prison, where he hustled to stay up on game and where he experienced the real Orange Is the New Black .\nIn his memoir UP ON GAME: From Robbing Banks to Stacking Bitcoin, Stanley recounts a tumultuous childhood of growing up in the dangerous neighborhood of Otay, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty.\nStanley illustrates what daily life was like in jail, his interactions with other inmates, and the dark side of the correctional officers whose jobs are to maintain law and order. After his release, Stanley learned the ropes of—and became successful in—adult online marketing with exotic dancers and professional escorts where he was introduced to Bitcoin as a form of payment.\nHe schooled himself in daytrading of cryptocurrency. Although he doesn’t say he’s an expert, he’s moved up in the world to swanky Newport Beach where he lives a life far from the hellhole of the two-man prison cell.\n“Brutally honest and shockingly real,” said one reviewer. “ Orange Is the New Black has nothing on this memoir,” said another.\nMEDIA : Contact for media review copies of the book (hard copy or ebook via Amazon), photos, to schedule an interview or speaking opportunity.\nSandra Wendel\nREAD the first chapter and for more info: www.UpOnGameBook.com View original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-robber-no-longer-needs-banks-turns-to-stacking-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrency-300656238.html\nSOURCE Richard Stanley ASICS y Disney animan a las familias a moverse » Noticias Hispanic PR Wire ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard stanley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nebraska latino news mundial bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neb.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T19:21:25.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a36a9231a079c48b9043df0de8f59b1380c3ae08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3.BL.c1iTwO0d9CW_zJkFhsvxDxNI5S41sCDRj1WFLmKapaqaiUUzNZ7_BKogBjS75IUnWBIPAUTH2YkDBaqRlY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "here's our latest piece of Bitcoin artwork, Bitcoin 'Black Marble.'

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but downsides remain supported above $950.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bullish zone above $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to gather pace above $1,040 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent support formed around the $870 level in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move and traded above the $900 resistance level. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,010 high to $870 low. During the upside move, the price also managed to clear a major barrier near $950.\nA break above the stated $950 resistance is a positive sign for buyers. More importantly, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent high was around $1,030 and the price is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high.\nLooking at the chart , the previous resistance near $950 is likely to act as a strong support. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high is near $950 to provide support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently near the 65 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,040 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Broke Key Resistance was last modified: May 30th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "po", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T09:19:10.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f500571e98b860d424d4013b6f885e64f81c6f62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7ZV1i4zp3r7XngYBl2F7m8-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f500571e98b860d424d4013b6f885e64f81c6f62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7ZV1i4zp3r7XngYBl2F7m8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInstall our official extension in Mozilla Firefox Store to start earning BTC – To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

The new mining motherboard is called Asus H370 Mining Master and comes with support for up to 20 GPUs using direct PCIe over USB connections. The presence of USB connectors directly fitted on the motherboard simplifies connectivity by letting USB riser cables plug directly into the PCB and this direct connection is sturdier than using a PCIe card, with less chance of inadvertent disconnects, and it also reduces the total number of parts in your rig.\nYou may notice that aside the 20 USB 3.0 connectors on the motherboard there is also a single PCI-E x16 slot, however this does not mean you are able to have a 21st GPU. The PCI-E x16 slot and the first USB 3.0 connector are labeled A01 and that share the same PCI-E lane, so you can have only one of them working with a GPU, not both at the same time.\nThe Asus H370 Mining Master motherboard includes a suite of diagnostic features designed to make your farm easier to diagnose and manage in case of problems. A very useful one is the GPU State Detection (available in the Asus B250 Mining Expert as well), which scans the system at boot and indicates whether each riser port is empty, connected to a functional graphics card, or experiencing problems. The updated State Detection GUI clearly identifies the location and status of each port along with the alphanumeric code that identifies it. To further streamline troubleshooting, the board will ship with matching alphanumeric labels to stick onto corresponding riser cards. You’ll be able to quickly look at the labels to find flagged GPUs instead of being forced to trace the path of cables connected to affected ports.\nAsus H370 Mining Master Specifications: – Size: ATX, 12″ x 9.1″ – Socket: LGA 1151 for Intel 8th Gen Core, Pentium, and Celeron processors – Memory: 2 x DIMMs (max. 32GB), DDR4 2666/2400/2133MHz, Non-ECC, unbuffered memory – Slots: 1 x PCIe x16 – Storage: 2 x Serial ATA 6Gbps – Networking: 1 x Intel Gigabit LAN – GPU riser ports: 20 x PCIe over USB (vertical) – USB ports: 6 x USB 3.1 Gen 1, 4 x USB 2.0/1.1 – Other: 1 x COM header\nEfficient mining also requires a few UEFI tweaks that are consolidated in a special Mining Mode on the motherboard. The PCIe lanes are set to run at Gen 1 speeds to improve compatibility and stability with USB riser cards, the Above 4G Decoding is enabled, which is critical for supporting lots of graphics cards, and Launch CSM is disabled, which lets the motherboard and graphics UEFIs synchronize with each other. Mining Mode is activated by default, so you’re ready to go right out of the box, without having to mess around in the firmware interface… after all this is a dedicated mining motherboard and it should be ready out of the box.\nJust like the predecessor B250 Mining Expert the new H370 Mining Master comes with a trio of 24-pin primary power supply connectors, so you can connect to up to three PSUs simultaneously. Each one is tied to a separate bank of riser ports, allowing you to scale up the number of GPUs gradually and add more power as needed. Some motherboards require modifications and special startup sequences to run on multiple PSUs, but the Master is tailored for the task.

But what interests traders the most is if the recent developments have changed anything in the current outlook. And we provide you with our answer to this question. One our readers have known for some time now. The media seem to have noticed that Bitcoin has depreciated. More Bitcoin-oriented outlets might even focus on market-specific events such as technical developments. In an article on CoinDesk, we read : Bitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years. With the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23. We generally do not disagree with the idea that the move belong the 50-week moving average might be a bearish indication. Taking a long-term point of view, the move below the moving average based on weekly closes might be a herald of more declines to come in the next few months. And we did see a move below this level and it seems to be confirmed. Does this mean that we only have declines in the cards? Not necessarily. No move in the market is certain unless it has already occurred. So, the move down is not certain but, for the long term, the move below the moving average might be an important event. Where our emphasis would go, however, is that the long-term moving average is one of the indicators that might be worth to monitor. It’s not the all-important yardstick but rather a gauge that should be looked at in conjunction with the analysis of other indicators. And we do just that. Double Retracements On BitStamp, we have seen a continued move down from the $10,000 level. This move down has now lasted roughly three weeks. The most recent development in the depreciation is the move down below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level based on the previous rally from around $6,500 to around $10,000. Bitcoin went down below this level last Wednesday (May 23) and, even more importantly, has stayed below this level for almost a week now and this suggests that the indication here is bearish as far as the short term is concerned. At the moment of writing, the currency is closing on the 78.6% retracement, a level possibly less important than the previous one, but a bearish indication nonetheless. If we take a look at other retracement levels, the ones based on the February rally, the implications are virtually unchanged. Bitcoin went below the 61.8% retracement and it’s at the 78.6% retracement. A move below this level would be bearish again. The fact that the retracement levels based on two time frames coincide and have almost identical indications suggests that any bearish indication here might be stronger that if it had been based on one set of retracements. Array of Support Levels On the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see a development which we have described in our alerts for some time now. Bitcoin went below the 78.6% retracement level and has remained below this level for some time now. The move seems to be confirmed. The 78.6% level is not an extremely important one, but the breakdown below this level contributes to the bearish outlook, in our opinion. Right now, the currency is declining in line with the long-term bearish trend. The next support level is around $6,500 but it’s not an extremely strong one. Actually, we have several support levels in the $5,500-6,500. From this area, the $5,500-6,000 looks like a stronger support. If we were to narrow this down some more, $6,000 might be a trigger for the next very important move. So, based on the indications we’re seeing right now, Bitcoin could potentially go down to $6,000 and if we see a move below this level, and particularly below $5,500, the decline might accelerate markedly and our current hypothetical profits might grow even further. A counter-trend rally might occur around $6,000 but any pullback could be very volatile , so it might not be easy or even possible to exit hypothetical positions and reenter them at higher prices. Consequently, it might be worth to sit out any weak correction if it occurs. Nothing of this is automatic and our approach might change as the situation unfolds. Stay tuned! Summing up, the decline continues and might become even deeper.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

BITCOIN & GOLD average cost and Market trend With latest news spreading FUD, price dropping and lot of uncertainty in the market, i want to share an idea that i had long time ago. After a thorough analyse i hope that i made my point with this post. You can read this post also on steemit ( join the community that pays you to post and curate high quality content ): GOLD If we compare BITCOIN with GOLD, we see that are bought by same kind of people. This way we may understand better BITCOIN price behaviour. Lot of the people that bought BITCOIN now, are maybe many of those who bought GOLD not long time ago. We can then assume, that both BITCOIN and GOLD are bought by same kind of investors. It seems that BITCOIN and GOLD appears to be as anti-establishment currencies. That means, the \"one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society\". See detailed term here: Anti-establishment - Wikipedia When people bought GOLD , they mainly did that because it is opposite of fiat. The same happens with BITCOIN. The next similarity is the mining operation to get them (even the mining process is very different, the result is the same) and they are both a finite amounts. Next step is to compare the markets and how they behave. The old rule with supply and demand is still there. When is more supply than demand then the market become saturated and that means Supply > Demand . That means that is nobody left to buy. So, that means the the price will drop. A special note: GOLD production cost has been set to a production cost of $1200 (the average cost to produce 1 ounce of gold is at $1200) . In this case, if the price drops below that average cost it will stop the mining and some of them will go bankrupt. Not being able to make profit and increasing losses will affect every mining company. That will cause panic in the market and if it continues to drop, also some of the mining companies are bankrupt and gone, then it will mean that less mining it will mean less supply and therefore more demand. So, the price will go up again. After the price will go above the production cost then more investors will come and so, more money in the market. The price will still go up -> the average person will be back again in the market making the price to go even higher. And so on... Human psychology push the price up and also down in the markets. The markets are used by humans (even with their own control or with bots that are made also by a human). The cycle repeats itself over the time. Market forces will always bring equilibrium and adjustments in the price. GOLD example: or in the link here The top price was in 2011 , then when falling down, it hit its production cost of $1200 twice in 2013 then in 2014-2015 it dropped below its production cost (at this moment lot of mining companies were out of business). After that, it finally made a bottom there and started to go up again. The final conclusion regarding GOLD example is that, knowing the production cost of a certain asset, will help the investor to understand better that asset. This way, you can say you know where is a bottom (floor). BITCOIN Elitefixtures.com had a research regarding average costs based on average electricity rates for 115 countries - sourced from government data - source: How Much Does It Cost to Mine Bitcoin Around the World? | Investopedia Having their research as a base, we can see that the BITCOIN production cost depends on which country you are.

Fees\nAs entrepreneur Alistair Milne noted this week, Bitcoin transactions fees have dropped to their lowest levels in seven years . Not since 2011 was it was so cheap to use Bitcoin, when the network was a tiny fraction of its current size and value.\nBitcoin has even started beating altcoin Bitcoin Cash on network fees – something which the latter’s proponents continue to hold up as one of its major features.\nIn future, increasing expansion of the Lightning Network is expected to drive fees below 1 satoshi per byte, keeping long-term transaction costs at a nearly negligible amount. SegWit\nPrior to Lightning’s mainstream adoption, however, 2018 saw mass uptake of Segregated Witness (‘SegWit’) technology, which for Bitcoin users also means lower fees and faster confirmation times.\nAs Bitcoinist reported earlier this month, SegWit transactions now make up a greater proportion of the total sent each week than ever before – almost 40% . Hashrate\nBitcoin’s hashrate also climbed to its largest in history in May. Data from Blockchain republished on Twitter by trader and commentator CryptoYoda impressed users, with theories including miners mining at a smaller profit in order to generate long-term holdings.\nThat theory echoes research presented last month suggesting Bitcoin could be at the start of another protracted ‘HODL’ period. in the meanwhile…\no Bitcoin Fee at its Cheapesto SegWit Adoption Rises to All-Time Higho Hashrate Steadily Climbing pic.twitter.com/DUtwJJL6PN\n— CryptoYoda (@CryptoYoda1338) May 28, 2018 Banks\nLastly, banking failures dominate the headlines this week, with Italy and the eurozone under political pressure and Australia and New Zealand lenders both suffering mass technical outages which cut customers off from their funds.\nAs Reuters reported May 26, National Australia Bank and the Bank of New Zealand were initially unable to confirm whether the problems were related or a coincidence. The source later turned out to be a power outage.\nBy comparison, the Bitcoin network has experienced 99.9923% uptime since it was launched back on January 3rd, 2009.\nWhat do you think are the best reasons to stay bullish on Bitcoin?

In an interview with The Independent , the former Bitcoin evangelist said that other cryptocurrencies were more technologically advanced than Bitcoin. He identified Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash as the harbingers of the coming flippening. Bitcoin is Outdated\nRoger Ver used to be one of the staunchest Bitcoin proponents around. These days, however, his tent is firmly pitched in the Bitcoin Cash camp , the first and most popular of all the Bitcoin forks . According to Ver, Bitcoin is outdated when compared to the technically superior features of the other coins presently in existence.\nVer believes that Bitcoin’s technology is rife with defects. These defects will ultimately lead to reduced interest in the premier cryptocurrency. In his opinion, many of the more than 1,600 digital currencies currently in existence have been developed to offer more robust and efficient solutions that Bitcoin. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash Will Overtake Bitcoin\nVer states that Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will experience significantly higher growths than Bitcoin in the coming months and years. He even goes as far as predicting that Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin before the year is out, with Bitcoin Cash taking center stage by 2020.\nI see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent. Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin by the end of the year, and Bitcoin Cash could do the same before 2020.\nThis series of events, known as the flippening , will occur when Bitcoin is no longer the dominant digital currency in the crypto market. According to Ver, Bitcoin’s modest gains over the next few years and months will be unable to keep up with the relentless march of Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Can and Will Adapt\nNot everyone agrees with Ver’s logic, however. Some experts believe that Bitcoin can assimilate any paradigm-shifting technology, thus maintaining its dominance of the market. Michael Jackson of venture firm Mangrove Capital Partners believes that Bitcoin will overcome the problems currently facing the network:\nThere is so much talent in the crypto space, and people are working on solving these scalability problems. I don’t see why bitcoin shouldn’t remain in the number one spot.

The Russian NSD (National Settlement Depository) has announced that it is working with Sberbank CIB to test the ICO emissions platform launched in April by the Bank of Russia.\nAccording to the announcement, the company called Level One will launch token sales in the test environment, for which Sberbank will act as the coordinator of the issue and the main investor. In turn, NSD will serve as a depository, registering and settling transactions, as well as securing assets. Companies claim that the platform will ultimately provide the transparency that would reduce the risk for traditional investors in the token issuance process. The test, along with feedback from the central bank, will help you improve the platform before it can be put into service: “Sberbank CIB believes that the Russian ICO market is very promising. Many Sberbank clients are interested in this type of investment, and we, after the entry into force of the relevant legal framework, plan to actively promote this service. We will be one of the factors driving the institutionalization and popularization of this type of transaction”– says Igor Bulantsev, senior vice president of Sberbank and head of Sberbank CIB. Eddie Astanin, chairman of the board of NSD, said that the ultimate goal of the project is to allow the emergence of a new type of asset for investors and the trading of digital assets on the secondary market.\nLet’s now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. After the price made a Hammer candlestick formation at the level of $6, 984, it bounced out of the falling wedge and broke out above the technical resistance at the levels of $7,247 and $7, 435. So far the market has stopped just below the weekly pivot at the level of $7,582, but it looks like the bulls might want to test the golden trend line resistance from below. This means the next target for bulls is seen at the level of $7,890.\nThe material has been provided by InstaForex Company – www.instaforex.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "forex analysis two", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sberbank cib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sberbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T13:07:34.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efa28784a84984408f483f81f355d4a96ab771ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwsdXD0QC7_I5SDj.gZnYGE-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efa28784a84984408f483f81f355d4a96ab771ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwsdXD0QC7_I5SDj.gZnYGE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

In the case involving a porn site and 191 confiscated BTC, the country’s top court upheld a district court’s ruling. Supreme Court Has Ruled Supreme Court of South Korea.\nSouth Korea’s top court ruled on Wednesday that the government could confiscate cryptocurrencies as crime profits since they are assets with economic value.\nThe case involves Ahn, who operated an online porn site, and his 191 BTC that the prosecution confiscated, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported . “This marks the first time a cryptocurrency has been subject to confiscation,” the Korea Times wrote.\nWith Wednesday’s ruling, “The Supreme Court recognized cryptocurrency as an ‘asset with measurable value,’” the publication detailed and quoted the Court stating:\nThe cryptocurrency is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated. 191 BTC Confiscated\n“From 2013, Ahn distributed 235,000 obscene pictures online and made 1.9 billion won,” the news outlet described, adding that he “was arrested and indicted in May 2017 for violating the Protection of Children and Juveniles From Sexual Abuse Law.” Ahn was subsequently “sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined 696 million won by a lower court, confirmed by both a high court and the Supreme Court.”\nWhen Ahn was arrested, the prosecution seized his 216 BTC, claiming that they “were earned illegally and urged they be seized as cyber assets,” the publication conveyed. However, a lower court ruled against them, “stating bitcoins only existed electronically and had no physical form.”\nThe prosecutors then appealed to a high court which “ruled in the prosecution’s favor, saying the cyber assets could be seen as profit earned from the trade in goods.” The high court ruled that 191 of “bitcoins [seized] were earned from the proceeds of crime,” and ordered them to be confiscated. At the time of this writing, this amount of BTC is worth over $1.4 million.\nThe publication quoted the high court explaining at the time:\nIf we return the bitcoins to Ahn, it will be giving him back profits that were earned illegally from running an online porn site.\n“The Supreme Court upheld this ruling,” the news outlet reiterated, adding that this “will allow any cyber assets gained from illegal activity such as gambling, drug deals, pornography and prostitution to be confiscated.”\nWhat do you think of the Korean Supreme Court’s ruling?

If it keeps holding as a floor, price could head back to the resistance around $9,000. Oscillators are suggesting that a return in bullish momentum is in order.\nBitcoin price is finding support at the bottom of its symmetrical triangle while oscillators indicate oversold conditions.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside, which suggests that a break below support is still possible.\nPrice is also trading below the 100 SMA so this moving average could hold as near-term resistance in a bigger bounce. The gap between the moving averages is sufficiently wide so there is no imminent threat of a bullish crossover.\nHowever, RSI is pulling up from oversold levels to signal that buyers are getting back on their feet. Similarly stochastic is moving out of the oversold region to signal a return in buying pressure. A bullish divergence can also be observed for this oscillator as stochastic made lower lows since April while bitcoin price made higher lows. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nEven though cryptocurrencies have been hit by risk-off flows recently, it looks like fears of rising anti-EU sentiment are driving up demand for bitcoin again. This has been particularly evident during previous referendums wherein euro zone nations threatened to leave the bloc.\nItaly is said to be headed for another round of polls as the coalition government leaders are unable to draw enough support. Some say that the elections could be a proxy for a referendum vote, possibly even spurring anti-EU sentiment in other countries like Spain and Portugal.\nThe polls aren’t likely to happen until late July or even September, which means continued political uncertainty in the region and a chance for anti-EU parties to gain more traction.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Fresh Hopes for the Bulls! appeared first on NewsBTC.

The buzz around Bitcoin reached a critical mass where people at home with no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology suddenly got caught up in a bubble. As the interest increased so did the price so it became a feedback loop.\nPeople saw their friends and coworkers talking about huge gains and wanted to get in on it. Coinbase allowed anyone with a smartphone and a checking account to buy Bitcoin which further drove up the price. Meanwhile the supply was only going up incrementally. So you had a huge swell in demand and no corresponding increase in supply. This resulted in the price increase.\nThen when the supply of buyers slowed down there were more sellers than buyers and the price dropped. This is the most classic form of a bubble and I'm surprised that people are looking for alternate explanations, like the introduction of futures, which I find absurd. If it were so easy to predict a crash simply because you now had a vehicle to short it, everyone would have done so. There are ways to short most securities that are traded and yet not all securities collapse in value. The author cites two examples of extreme bubbles- the subprime mortgage market and Bitcoin in late 2017- and blames the crashes on the creation of vehicles to short them. In reality the mortgage market didn't crash until people started defaulting on debt en masse and the vehicles to short the mortgages existed a long time before the market crashed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:30:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa09e3f2e09a833a85b1d2e10ceecb30a1f8b320", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3mwIxy0pU61vHAGJIG0.7I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa09e3f2e09a833a85b1d2e10ceecb30a1f8b320", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3mwIxy0pU61vHAGJIG0.7I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvest your time and effort inviting new users and you will guarantee a high passive income for yourself for a long time.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but downsides remain supported above $950.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bullish zone above $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to gather pace above $1,040 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent support formed around the $870 level in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move and traded above the $900 resistance level. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,010 high to $870 low. During the upside move, the price also managed to clear a major barrier near $950.\nA break above the stated $950 resistance is a positive sign for buyers. More importantly, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent high was around $1,030 and the price is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high.\nLooking at the chart , the previous resistance near $950 is likely to act as a strong support. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high is near $950 to provide support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently near the 65 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T09:42:24.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82f9d90c5c1bb06813158514470ee0851db8acaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFO9EPHu0B5TtHwAk9iN73Muead8gnS8yWX05sIU37_p.lq0swAbj9YGcrXbrdqtSx_8RZpjY40g3a7K1Gn1cARrZ1k8qQQ.q2P", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Korea Seizes Bitcoin Worth $1.4 Million Following Supreme Court Ruling", "title_full": "Korea Seizes Bitcoin Worth $1.4 Million Following Supreme Court Ruling", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/X9la2j-1024x683.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82f9d90c5c1bb06813158514470ee0851db8acaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFO9EPHu0B5TtHwAk9iN73Muead8gnS8yWX05sIU37_p.lq0swAbj9YGcrXbrdqtSx_8RZpjY40g3a7K1Gn1cARrZ1k8qQQ.q2P", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Morning", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Korea Seizes Bitcoin Worth $1.4 Million Following Supreme Court Ruling", "text": "\nKorea Seizes Bitcoin Worth $1.4 Million Following Supreme Court Ruling\nThe South Korean government is moving to confiscate 191 bitcoins seized in a child-porn cybercrime case in which the perpetrator has now been sentenced to jail and a $640,000 fine.\nAccording to Korean news agency Yonhap , the move comes after South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that cryptocurrencies can be seen as property with value that can be subject to forfeiture in criminal cases.\nAs of press time, the nearly 200 bitcoins are worth a little over $1.4 million, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index .\nThe Supreme Court order backs up a previous ruling from an appeal that overturned a lower court’s decision to reject a prosecutor’s petition to forfeit the criminal’s cryptocurrency assets.\nAccording to Yonhap, the lower court denied the request based on the argument that cryptocurrencies only “exist electronically and have no physical form.” However, the appeals court later concluded that cryptocurrency can be seen as “profit earned from trade in goods.”\nIt remains unclear, however, as to how the South Korea authority would handle the forfeited digital assets. That said, today’s decision marks a notable legal reference, since there are ongoing criminal cases in South Korea involving cryptocurrencies.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, prosecutors from the Incheon district filed a suit in December 2017 against a firm called Max Mining and 21 suspects in an alleged $250-million cryptocurrency mining fraud.\nMost recently, prosecutors in Seoul have also raided several local cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions of fraud and embezzlement , reportedly seizing assets for further investigation.\nGavel and Korean won image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

According to the settlement of researchers from Singapore and Australia, quantum computers will be able to successfully gain control over Bitcoin network in 2027. With some reservations: modern ASIC-miners have incredible power, and it is impossible to compete with them. By 2027, quantum computers can achieve a maximum of 13 gigahash/sec, even with a rapid development, with 4.4 million qbits (today’s maximum – 55 qbits), and still it will be a thousand times less than an ASIC with 14 terahash/sec.\nIt will not work if you just mine blocks. ASIC will always be faster than quantum computers, because there are tasks in which quantum computers do not have an advantage, and this is only one of them.\nBut there is another way. You can crack Bitcoin’s signature using Shor’s algorithm, and place fake transactions in the blockchain, stealing coins. There is also a solution for this problem, but it requires a hardfork. Since signatures are the most vulnerable thing in such networks, they must be replaced and strengthened. There are already several proposals for replacing the signature algorithm. One of them is a replacement for a reversible atomic digital signature. Unlike the existing schemes, we start with a base signature of 8192 bits, 32 times the size of Bitcoin’s signature. Our ODS8192 is an 8192 bit hash providing 8192 bits of security against collision attacks and using a formulated process goes all the way up to 65536 bits. In this case, the hash from public key and signature will be 2048 characters instead of 64. This digital signature scheme is secure against attacks for the next 1000 years.\nAnother suggestion is to use an “ideal lattice”, an algorithm that is used in Monero.\nMany researchers are now working on creating addresses that would be quantum-stable. You need just a softfork to implement it. Why not to implement it right now? Here is a simple answer: this will greatly increase the size of blockchain itself. But since before 2027 there is nothing to worry about, it is unnecessary.

After reaching initials lows earlier in the day of just above US$7,000, Bitcoin saw a huge jump to above $7,400, and is continually inching higher. If things play out well, this could lead to a summer frenzy, similar to was witnessed at this time last year.\nIn the month of April, Bitcoin saw an almost 50% growth- from lows of US$6,600 to local highs above $9,600. While this was a strong indication that the bear cycle had ended, May’s woes have acted as a reinforcement of the bleed seen between January and March of this year. However, Bitcoin’s appreciation of close to 5% marks the highest performing day since the first week of May.\nPerhaps more exciting is the performance of altcoins alongside BTC. Out of the top 100 coins listed on coinmarketcap, all have seen dollar appreciation within the past 24 hours. The worst performer, of course, is Tether, which remains pegged at US$1. Almost half of the top 100 has seen double digit appreciation, more than doubling that of Bitcoin. This surge is led by Bytecoin (BCN) and Nexus (NXS), with 35% and 25% growth, respectively. Altcoins globally saw an increase in market cap from US$182 billion to $201 billion, or roughly 10%.\nUnfortunately, today’s performance alone does not cancel out May’s losses. The global market cap of all cryptocurrencies is down 30% from early May highs. To reach similar valuations, today’s activity would have to sustain itself and spill into June. Fortunately, sentiments surrounding the cryptocurrency space seem to be improving. Cryptocurrency magnate and John McAfee Tweeted his prediction of a US$15,000 Bitcoin by the end of June. While this 100% increase would be significant, McAfee’s altcoin calls are far loftier. The antivirus entrepreneur suggests that both Bitcoin Private (BTCP) and Golem (GNT) will see more than ten times growth by July, accompanied by 3-5x increases from a handful of other altcoins. My short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump’s June 12th date. They have never been wrong. pic.twitter.com/IGAzWPtOV4\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 24, 2018\nMuch of the cryptocurrency community consists of college students, and as such, a major volume increase is likely when all return home from school. If both a sustained growth of price and volume coexist into the start of June, the field may be set for a similarly exciting summer as was experienced in 2017. While December all-time highs seem to be very distant benchmarks, hopefuls throughout are suggesting that these price levels may be retrieved sooner, rather than later.\nFull details at themerkle.com/everything-green-as-price-of-bitcoin-approaches-7500/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "everything green as price of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "network technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:40:00.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ef8df3f3436cb246eb5c3ce30f83dd1e7a9381a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9NDrhw9oM8X5GyMe0AaqjezNYZrEiTxjwBA7C6b2veuxxDgvQ9z0H13VGdOuatgmrERRA4yDDD8ti8YPHcNSn_9VqIu14E8JqJ9wjDNDbV2w--", "site_full": "www.venturecanvas.com", "site": "venturecanvas.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – May 30 | #VentureCanvas - VentureCanvas", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – May 30 | #VentureCanvas - VentureCanvas", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ef8df3f3436cb246eb5c3ce30f83dd1e7a9381a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9NDrhw9oM8X5GyMe0AaqjezNYZrEiTxjwBA7C6b2veuxxDgvQ9z0H13VGdOuatgmrERRA4yDDD8ti8YPHcNSn_9VqIu14E8JqJ9wjDNDbV2w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – May 30 | #VentureCanvas - VentureCanvas", "text": "\nrsachar | Fintech Roundup Micro-finance banking software developer Oradian has closed funding from Goodwell Investments, just days after its previous equity round.

If that hasn’t already blown your mind, just wait till you see who she’s been working with.\nThe reality TV star and social media influencer is listed as an author on a paper published in a scientific journal earlier this month, and her co-author is none other than Satoshi Nakamoto – the mysterious recluse and inventor of Bitcoin , whose identity has never been revealed.\nStrange company to keep, and the nature of their collaboration is even stranger.\nTheir paper, published in Drug Designing & Intellectual Properties International Journal , is an impenetrable treatise on the topic of ‘Wanion’, an algorithm methodology for optimising e-commerce systems.\nThe sheer technical language of the paper suggests Nakamoto may have led the work, because Wanion’s complexity seems a world away from Kim K’s usual fare. Or perhaps the third author, computer scientist Tomáš Pluskal from MIT, shouldered the bulk of the writing.\nIn comments to Retraction Watch, Pluskal spoke glowingly of working with Kardashian.\n“I have always thought that Kim’s scientific talents were a bit under-appreciated, so I wanted to give her the opportunity to show this unknown side of her,” Pluskal says .\n“Needless to say, the science presented in the paper would never have reached such high quality without her input.”\nYet… if you read the paper, the ‘high quality’ of the commentary is somewhat questionable.\n“In recent years, much research has been devoted to the synthesis of the Turing machine; nevertheless, few have enabled the deployment of systems,” the paper opens .\n“In this work, we show not only that e-commerce can be made cacheable, semantic, and client-server, but that the same is true for vacuum tubes.”\nHmm. We’re no experts on e-commerce or vacuum tubes, but something about that doesn’t read quite right.\nThe journal the work appears in is published by a company called Lupine Publishers. That name has a vaguely sinister, predatory ring to it – which is ironically fitting, because (surprise!) this entire study is a sham .\nAs Pluskal explained to Retraction Watch, the paper – which neither Kardashian or Satoshi Nakamoto actually co-authored – isn’t a real study, but a contrived fake designed as yet another sting on predatory journals .\nThese journals prey on up-and-coming scientists who are desperate to get noticed in their fields, by charging them exorbitant fees to get their research published, while skipping the peer review process that gives scientific literature its integrity.\nIn this case, it turns out none of the authors were actually legit, and the paper is gibberish.\nWhile Pluskal set up the sting, he had computers write the paper for him, using an MIT program called SCIgen that automatically stitches together scientific-sounding text, and which has previously fooled journals into publishing nonsense.\nOf course, the chaotic output generated by the program is completely meaningless. But that doesn’t mean SCIgen isn’t useful, at least when your tongue is firmly embedded in your cheek.\n“I have been using SCIgen for a while,” Pluskal told Retraction Watch .\n“It is a fantastic tool that saves so much time and reduces the burden and stress associated with paper preparation. It’s cutting-edge MIT technology at its best.”\nSo, sadly, it seems Kim Kardashian is not a published scientist after all. But that doesn’t mean she hasn’t made an important contribution to the field .\nThe ‘findings’ are reported in Drug Designing & Intellectual Properties International Journal .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim kardashian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinterest kim kardashian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim k", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wanion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug designing & intellectual properties international journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:48:58.058+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1815f29dc8ec2dbcead450836abab8788da55cc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw2X9Y_DImNWaHX.W8z3Bus-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1815f29dc8ec2dbcead450836abab8788da55cc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw2X9Y_DImNWaHX.W8z3Bus-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite active friends who will invite their friends - and start making real money!

This is most significant when you consider that very recently, we had to deal with the fact Bitcoin came very close to breaching below $7,000.00, last time this happened we saw an extended period of resistance that in turn crippled the markets . By remaining steadily above $7,500.00, we can expect that, if, a market surge or bull run does take off, Bitcoin will see a jump past $8,000.00 with ease.\nThroughout the day, we have seen Bitcoin sustain around figures of $7,450.00 plus, which means that finally Bitcoin is proving its worth at this level. Of course, Bitcoin is still well undervalued but overall, balancing out at $7,500.00 is far better than it could be right now.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $7,521.64, up 1.05%. Granted, this current trajectory isn’t the mark of a massive incline, however, we must consider what this could mean going forward.\nWe have seen market-wide gains for around a day now, suggesting that what we are seeing now, may very well be the start of a much larger market surge, or a bull run. Of course, this could be down to correction and indeed, the bear market may take hold once again, however as it stands, we remain optimistic that this could be the start of a small surge, that could in turn lead to a recovery for Bitcoin, moreover, it could also lead to an all-out bull run, which could see Bitcoin move back up to $10,000.00, as (almost) recorded just a few weeks ago.\nAccording to CCN:\n“The mid-term trend of the bitcoin price still remains bearish, and it is possible that BTC dips below the $7,000 region before initiating a major bull run or a strong rally. If BTC breaks through the $7,600 mark and continues its run towards $7,800, the start of a proper mid-term bull run is likely, but if BTC fails to sustain momentum in the $7,500 region, BTC will likely move back down to the lower end of the $7,000 region and eventually to mid-$6,000.”\nSee more from CCN for yourself, here- https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rebounds-to-7500-still-early-for-a-bull-run/\nSo, what next?\nAssuming Bitcoin can keep up this pace for another couple of days then, we might very well see a bigger surge take over as we enter June, this is something that is sure to bring some optimism to the markets. If Bitcoin jumps up, the markets will indeed follow and thus we could expect to see a market-wide recovery take hold.\nFor now, we need to wait and see how Bitcoin performs around this crucial figure. The better it does, the more likely we are to see a big market surge. However, bear in mind that as I have mentioned, this could just be a temporary blip and indeed, Bitcoin could continue to move back down as we enter a new month, a thought many investors may want to avoid for the moment.

The decision could provide greater clarity on cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country.\nSouth Korea's supreme court has upheld an appellate court ruling that 191 bitcoin (approximately $1.4 million at press time) should be confiscated from a convicted man identified in reports by the name \"Ahn,\" who had been previously found guilty of running a pornographic website in violation of the country's Protection of Children and Juveniles From Sexual Abuse Law. The Korea Times reports that the decision represents the first instance of a Korean court calling for the seizure of any cryptocurrency.\nIn the May 30 ruling, the Supreme Court described bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies by extension, as an \"asset with measureable [sic] value,\" adding that cryptocurrency \"is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated.\"\nAccording to analysis from Korean media, the decision paves the way for future confiscations of cryptocurrency that is deemed to have been acquired illegally. A lower court had initially ruled against the seizure of Ahn's bitcoin on the grounds that digital assets exist only in electronic form and have no physical counterpart.\nAfter he was sentenced to an 18-month prison term and a fine of roughly $650,000 (at press time), prosecutors urged the confiscation of some 216 bitcoin in Ahn's possession. The supreme court ordered the seizure of 191 of those tokens, describing them as funds paid for illegal content.\nIt's unclear how Ahn, who reportedly engaged in cryptocurrency trading, acquired the remaining 25 bitcoin. Of the 191 bitcoin, the court said in its decision: \"If we return the bitcoins to Ahn, it will be giving him back profits that were earned illegally from running an online porn site.\"\nIn other jurisdictions, including the US , government entities have already confiscated cryptocurrency. Last week, police in the UK seized \"approximately £500,000 worth of Bitcoin\" from a hacker.

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were \"a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction\".\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n\"It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it's mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.\"\nAnd that's where the havoc begins.\n\"People dive in because they don't want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.\"\nIn that regard, it wasn't surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n\"I think it's an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That's what a compulsive gambler wants.\" A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n\"It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It's a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.\"\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n\"It's relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don't know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it's relatively easy.\"\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n\"A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don't want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.\"\nThe situation \"just goes bad\" from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n\"They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don't realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.\"\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late.\n\"Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.\"\nThe moment of realisation was depressingly familiar.\n\"It's usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.\"\nCastle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew koubaridis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "noosa news bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nottingham trent university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:02:03.005+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 22408, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=9800", "requestsLeft": 564}
