Maersk trialed the system and is using it for its marine hull insurance. Microsoft Azure provides the blockchain technology using ACORD standards, according to Seatrade Maritime News. Platform Automates Processes\nLars Henneberg, head of risk and insurance for AP Moller – Maersk, said moving to the platform has helped automate manual processes and reduced inefficiencies for the company, which owns 350 container vessels worldwide.\nThe technology will manage risk for more than 1,000 vessels and support more than 500,000 transactions in the first year.\nAlastair Swift, CEO of Willis Towers Watson, said blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize insurance. He said the first insurance transaction done on the blockchain has simplified and streamlined the transactional process and created added value for the company’s clients.\nPolicies will be automatically updated to reflect risk using IoT and smart contracts, according to Martin Henley, chief information officer of XL Catlin. The company is ready to begin working on opening the platform to other insurance segments.\nMicrosoft and Guardtime intend to extend Insurwave to the global logistics, marine cargo, energy and aviation sectors.\nAlso read: EY, Microsoft and shipping giant Maersk develop blockchain marine insurance platform ‘Groundbreaking’ Corda Deployment\nTodd McDonald, head of partnerships and co-founder at the R3 blockchain conglomerate, said on the R3 website that Insurwave is groundbreaking deployment of R3’s Corda software, which is now available on Microsoft’s Azure platform.\nMcDonald noted that Insurwave connects clients, brokers, insurers and third parties to distributed common ledgers that integrate identity, risk and exposure data into insurance contracts.\nThe Corda blockchain can link data from multiple parties to policy contracts, McDonald explained. The blockchain can receive and respond to information that results in a business process or price change. It can record information about assets and transactions, then validate notification and loss data. The key benefits are lower costs, higher sales and rules compliance.\nAll parties to the contract are privy to real-time visibility into condition, safety and location of assets being transported worldwide, delivering fair and accurate pricing and underwriting, McDonald said. Participants also reap operational savings from improved use of claims processing, risk management and policy amendment personnel.\nThe product offers new business opportunities for multinational shippers like Maersk that provide risk an insurance for cargo customers.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T01:04:10.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "578447c5dc5016c9ba9b08e07fb69a9543769c59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9V_QWj8UdBdroWTkaxDr0znt4ySlTKKGNbZ7Z0jFlv0Or6O1LLO6.ifrX59ngaxdTCpJp0jQbenmdrMtp0PCL8kYgMGlnkDA0dxeH7GarV44AKL9Pr3fqBUI0.T6P_SaU2vVJ38m7yFbQKPVYbrxBE_31vP0pIsD0PXjzGjcRmFA--", "site_full": "www.couriermail.com.au", "site": "couriermail.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News and News Headlines | The Courier Mail", "title": "London mosque accepts bitcoin donations", "title_full": "London mosque accepts bitcoin donations | The Courier-Mail", "published": "2018-05-28T20:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.864, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14432, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "578447c5dc5016c9ba9b08e07fb69a9543769c59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9V_QWj8UdBdroWTkaxDr0znt4ySlTKKGNbZ7Z0jFlv0Or6O1LLO6.ifrX59ngaxdTCpJp0jQbenmdrMtp0PCL8kYgMGlnkDA0dxeH7GarV44AKL9Pr3fqBUI0.T6P_SaU2vVJ38m7yFbQKPVYbrxBE_31vP0pIsD0PXjzGjcRmFA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2018-05-28T20:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "London mosque accepts bitcoin donations", "text": "World Breaking News London mosque accepts bitcoin donations Reuters May 29, 2018 2:29am\nLooking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders say.\n\"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n\"For the donor, it&apos;s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque&apos;s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said.\nEgypt&apos;s Grand Mufti, the nation&apos;s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque&apos;s decision.\n\"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It&apos;s ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than STG10,000 ($A17,603).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 per cent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.\n London mosque accepts bitcoin donations\n Most viewed Is this the end for XXXX brewery?

The Bitcoin market seems to be running out of steam, and it now looks as if we are going to test the most recent bottom of overall trading. Against the US dollar, I expect to see this market test the $7000 level rather quickly, and then perhaps the $6500 level. Below there, the $6000 level is a major barrier, and if we were to break down below there it’s hard to tell where this market would stop falling. I expect $6000 to put up a significant fight, and I look at rallies at this point as an opportunity to continue to sell a market that clearly has no momentum. The highs continue to get lower, which by itself is a very negative sign. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin also fell against the Japanese yen as you would expect, reaching towards the ¥800,000 level. I think that the market is probably going to go looking towards the ¥700,000 level underneath which is the bottom of the longer-term consolidation. It rallies at this point are to be sold and I don’t have an argument for buying this market right now. I think that longer-term investors may be looking to hold on, but quite frankly the Bitcoin markets have been decimated over the last couple of months. It surprises me that I still get a lot of questions about these markets, but if you are planning on profiting from owning Bitcoin, you need to be able to wait quite some time to collect your profits because I think we are still in the process of trying to find the bottom. Currently, it appears that ¥700,000 might be that bottom, but if it falls below there, look out below. \\n\\n\n\\n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T12:29:48.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a163fbc000472c2f0f07cdd5e8e8a746dd74555b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIAYWt_vvozJo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nOf course, Bitcoin is too much risky than any other investments. Bitcoin is decentralize and the price really depends on the demands of millions of people around the world. Bitcoin is also not safe and protected so let's all be vigilant to keep our password safe. Try to install application like google authenticator for additional security.

This signals that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. \\n\nThis could also mean that a break of the triangle support around $7,350 is imminent. The 100 SMA lines up with the top of the short-term descending channel to add to its strength as resistance while the 200 SMA adds another dynamic resistance before the top of the triangle at $9,000. \\n\nRSI is pointing up to signal that bulls could still push higher, though. Stochastic is also turning higher to reflect a return in bullish momentum, which might be enough for a test of the near-term resistance at $8,000. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nBitcoin and its peers have been on the back foot recently as the lack of positive updates and the liquidation of more bitcoin on Mt. Gox have spurred declines. This time, there is some degree of focus on regulation but developments in the industry could lead to positive sentiment. \\n\nFor one, there’s the mainnet launch for both Tron and EOS that would make them independent of the Ethereum network. Although this probably won’t have a direct influence on bitcoin price, any improvement in investor outlook could still lift altcoins overall. \\n\nBesides, the dollar has the NFP report to contend with and weak results could further dampen tightening expectations. Apart from that, overall risk sentiment in the financial markets, particularly relating to trade talks and political uncertainties, could lead to some volatility. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Make or Break Situation appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bulls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T12:18:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b3dc8cad1022d2bcb87f2b492960c5754a3532e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNPQYUZFGypLXv7m.NKFsWeIA80MoFALJOn9yytdtCzdNNPg1MdoPPcSOjfhB69Ft3fHU1mHT75T4Oem4tn2cg0Jg1qfj2V01Cg--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is struggling", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is struggling", "published": "2018-05-28T20:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.053, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b3dc8cad1022d2bcb87f2b492960c5754a3532e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNPQYUZFGypLXv7m.NKFsWeIA80MoFALJOn9yytdtCzdNNPg1MdoPPcSOjfhB69Ft3fHU1mHT75T4Oem4tn2cg0Jg1qfj2V01Cg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-28T20:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is struggling", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is struggling to move above the $1,000 and $1,050 resistances against the US Dollar. \\n There is a connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,010 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair is currently consolidating above the $950 level and is preparing for the next move. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is consolidating in a range against the US Dollar.

May in Warsaw, Andreas said Antonopoulos with a passion for Bitcoin. The Blockchain, however, was not the currencies in his eyes, “Bullshit” and without Crypto to use.\nAndreas Antonopoulos, who had made the most of 2014 with his book “Mastering Bitcoin” is a name that is considered Bitcoin-advocates. Unconventional expressed he appreciates the “special ability” of bitcoin and the ability to push through its decentralization of the large companies. Strange people invest in Bitcoin\nIn his speech of 12. May at the Bitcoin conference in Warsaw compared Antonopoulos Bitcoin with the Gentrifzierung. In the true sense of the word gentrification means the structural change of the Metropolitan district, to make way for a new clientele more attractive. In practice, it usually comes to a transformation of the cool, creative, special residential areas to the overpriced, boring luxury residential areas. The censorship, which is driven mostly by large companies, is the beginning of a such gentrification, which, strange boring, so Antonopoulos. This phenomenon, he also see in the Internet. As an example he cited here Facebook. While the grandparents want to take with your grandchildren, contact, create a Facebook Account, the young people on the basis of this “Ageing”. The bridge to the Bitcoin hits Antonopolous here on the Blockchain:\n“The reason why crypto-currencies, especially Bitcoin, are interesting, is that they are not controlled, they can not be censored and that you are open to the public. And because the people involved are very, very strange […] you have strange notions of privacy and freedom. Because of this peculiar people, I, too, am involved in Bitcoin.“\nIf you were to remove these aspects of Bitcoins, however, would be only the Blockchain left with a “sterile, dull, unused area.” Without this “odd” Bitcoins, the Blockchain would be just an “empty shell”. In Antonopoulos’ eyes, the Blockchain is basically just a “slow database”. What may be forgotten is the supporter of Bitcoins, perhaps, is that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin without Blockchain conceivable. Bet the future of the Blockchain\nSimilar shades a few days were heard on the Consensus in New York. There Jimmy Song about the Blockchain, said: “I don’t see winning a lot of this stuff is ground of liability. Bitcoin, the real Innovation is here.“ Song went as far as to bet with Joe Lubin, the founder of the Ethereum-Start-Ups, Consensys, whether the Blockchain have a future.

We turned on the Roku-looking machine in our San Francisco offices and allowed it to do its job. A small fortune was soon amassed, now worth around $100,000. Then, we lost the money. Forever.\nHere’s what happened to WIRED’s 13 Bitcoins—and to the millions of others that have faced the same fate. Stefan Antonowicz, WIRED’s then-head of engineering, set up the miner. Robert McMillan, a former senior writer for WIRED (who now works at The Wall Street Journal ), then wrote about it. “When we received that Butterfly miner, we had a new ethical question: What do you do with the proceeds of a review device that essentially prints money?” says McMillan. First, it’s probably worth explaining how WIRED accrued its six-figure Bitcoin fortune. While fiat currencies, like the dollar, rely on banks and government regulators, Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network monitored by an army of volunteer miners that run specialized software. Every 10 minutes, all the miners in the network race to solve a series of complex cryptographic math problems. The computers that win are awarded a slice of 12.5 new bitcoins. (That number halves every four years; it was 25 when we got our miner.) Usually, the fastest computers in the network solve the problems first. Over time, the puzzles have gotten harder, leading to a kind of computing-power arms race. Back when Bitcoin first launched, it was possible to mine coins using an everyday computer. These days, you’ll need specialized hardware significantly more powerful than the Butterfly Labs miner WIRED had. Currently, there are about 17 million bitcoins in existence; by 2020, all 21 million planned Bitcoins will have been mined. You can learn more about the process in our Guide to Bitcoin.) WIRED’s miner essentially won the Bitcoin math lottery a couple of times, allowing it to generate a little over 13 coins into the network. Then, the staff had to figure out what to do with them. “We had a very long conversation, over several weeks, about what to do with the money,” says Michael Calore, a senior editor at WIRED who has been at the magazine since 2006. Some staff members argued the Bitcoin should be donated, or set aside for a charitable purpose in the future. Others said it had to be destroyed permanently. What was agreed upon was that the money shouldn’t just sit there, because it could influence how the magazine reported on cryptocurrencies. “I said we had to dump it and donate the money to charity soonest or we wouldn’t be able to cover Bitcoin,” says Adam Rogers, a deputy editor at WIRED. “We had to disclose it in every story.” Eventually, it was decided that the private key, which unlocks the Bitcoin wallet and allows the funds to be spent, should be destroyed. “We talked about donating it to a journalism institution, or setting it aside as a scholarship. But we decided that if we gained any benefit from it at all, it would color our future coverage of bitcoin,” says Calore. “So we just destroyed the key, knowing full well that it could eventually be worth six or seven figures.” McMillan then posted a story announcing the key had been ripped to pieces. Throwing Away the Key To deal in bitcoin, you need at least two different keys, one public and one private (newer security protocols allow you to add more private keys). Together, the combination of codes lets you trade Bitcoin without an intermediary like a bank. You can look up WIRED’s public key to send us money, and then in theory, we could use our private key to access those funds—had we not destroyed it. It’s extremely unlikely we could successfully guess the code: it’s 64 digits long and no one remembers what it was. No additional copies of the private key exist, at least according to the people who were there. “I didn’t make a copy of the paper, or commit the 64 characters on it to memory,” says Antonowicz, the technologist who set up the miner. The good news is that if someone did move the coins, the transaction would be public, allowing WIRED to see where they traveled to. In fact, you too can check out WIRED’s lost Bitcoins right here. In theory, we might be able to recover the Bitcoin wallet from the hard drive where it was stored, but even that wouldn’t be much help. “There might have been a way to forensically recover the wallet—with the encrypted key—from my hard drive, but I shredded that particular drive years ago,” says Antonowicz. Plus, even if the wallet was resurrected, it’s encrypted. Breaking that protection via brute force would take an unimaginable amount of time. There are three times more possible combinations than there are atoms in the observable universe, by Antonowicz’s count. “Originally I was going to say that the closest metaphor I have is that we dropped a car key somewhere in the Atlantic, but I think it’s closer for me to say we dropped the key somewhere between here and the Alpha Centauri,” says Antonowicz. Recovering our bitcoins is essentially like trying to recover a photo album on a lost computer. Except not only did you get rid of the hard drive, you also protected the album in an encrypted folder with a 64-digit passcode that you threw away. Still, we wanted to make sure there was absolutely no way to get the bitcoins back. WIRED’s editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, suggested that if we were able to recover the funds, they might go toward hiring a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. I reached out to the founder of Butterfly Labs, who didn’t respond. I also contacted Mark Frauenfelder, a writer and the author of a WIRED article about how he recovered $30,000 worth of Bitcoin. He agrees we’re screwed. “If you lost your private keys I think it’s game over,” he says. I also looked into a service that tries to crack cryptocurrency wallets via sheer brute force. But their services would be no help, since we don’t have access to the hard drive itself. It looks like WIRED really did lose the money forever. The good news is we’re far from alone. Lost and Never Found Chainalysis, a research firm that analyzes activity across different cryptocurrency markets, estimates that between 2.78 and 3.79 million, or between 17 and 23 percent of all bitcoins have been lost. That includes wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of Bitcoin who hasn’t touched his estimated 1 million coins since 2011. “The number of lost coins over time will drop,” says Michael Gronager, the CEO and co-founder of Chainalysis. He argues that it’s because there’s more awareness of Bitcoin’s enduring value, even if the price wildly fluctuates. He also says that even if Satoshi were to reemerge, his activity wouldn’t significantly impact the market because he wouldn’t likely spend a large sum of Bitcoin at once. There are several ways you can lose Bitcoin. Like WIRED, you can simply lose track of your private key or your hard drive. One of the most famous cases of this is what happened to James Howells, an IT worker in London who lost 7,500 bitcoins, or around $56 million, when his laptop was thrown away in 2013. He reportedly wants to dig through five years of trash to unearth the computer. This is the most common way to lose Bitcoin; even Elon Must tweeted that he forgot how to access a portion of a coin. You can also lose bitcoins by running buggy code or making software mistakes, though these instances are more rare. Last year, for example, someone forgot to collect their mining reward and burned 12.5 coins. In another similar incident, someone may have accidentally swapped a processing fee with the value of the transaction, resulting in nearly 300 coins lost. One time, someone even sent 2,600 coins to an incorrectly configured address, burning them into nonexistence. All of these examples come from BlockSci, a tool developed at Princeton University for analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain. It can be difficult to assess whether any given bitcoin is really lost for good. “It’s actually pretty difficult to say for certain. A lot of what we do is look at the big picture,” says Harry Kalodner a PhD at Princeton who helped develop BlockSci. He says part of the problem is that you can rarely determine whether someone is just holding onto their Bitcoin, or whether they’ve definitively lost access to it. Since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any single authority, there’s no one who can simply close your account. So what could WIRED have done, were we to do the whole thing again? Since 2013, Bitcoin has added a number of new, more sophisticated features. For one, we could have locked our coins away until a certain date. “One Bitcoin feature that’s been added is that it now supports time-locked coins, that makes them completely un-spendable until a set point in the future,” says Kalodner. Like, say, May 2018, when the editor-in-chief could really use some money to hire another reporter.

Here are some VERY interesting facts:\n/u/dan_from_san_diego\nTl; Dr --- Just skip to the last paragraph.\nI have met with numerous large mining operations in the last two years (in the US, a few countries in Europe and China). I have seen a lot of different ways to set up mining centers.\nThe miners who pay the least in electricity pay about $0.03 per kwh. These are miners based in Washington State and some small operations in the European Alps. Both of these operations use hydro power.\nChinese miners pays about $0.04 per kwh. Some pay a little less and some pay a little more.\nSome miners are inefficient at cooling and some are very efficient. Using HVAC is the most expensive. The small operations in the Alps are using the natural cool air to cool their miners. This seems to be the most cost-effective. The next most cost-effective is liquid submersion cooling.\nNatural air-cooled mining centers are the cheapest to build. They basically just need fans to pull in the cool outside air and exhaust fans to exhaust it. These systems add about 5% in energy consumption for each miner.\nHVAC is pretty costly to purchase and adds about 25% in energy consumption to each miner.\nLiquid submersion cooling is very expensive to build but it is the most efficient. You can disconnect the cooling fans when the miner is submerged in liquid. This saves about 8% on energy usage per miner. So, liquid submersion cooling actually SAVES energy costs BUT it is crazy expensive to build.\nS9 miner = 0.00082 btc per day = $6 per day Cost of electricity for each S9 miner = $1.25 per day Cost of electricity for each air cooling for each S9 = $0.07 per day Cost of electricity for HVAC per S9 = $0.25 per day Cost of electricity for liquid cooling per S9 = $0 per day\nSo, the miners who pay $0.03 - $0.04 per kwh AND spent the millions on liquid submersion cooling are the miners who can remain running the longest when the price drops substantially.\nPeople feel that Bitmain h as a distinct advantage in mining because they build the miners AND they run them as well. I have determined that this is NOT an issue at all for large miners who purchased their systems prior to February, 2018. If you purchased your miners before the recent drop really kicked in (around February) then you could have sold them after purchasing for a profit of $1,000 (then you would, obviously, immediately re-purchase). This will put your cost of each miner in line with Bitmain. Thus...you are on even ground with them as a competitor.\nMost large miners bought their equipment and built their mining infrastructure when the price was rising. This means that most large miners are in VERY good positions because their infrastructure is likely paid off.\nSo, the best miners are currently making about $5 per day in profits for each miner. And the best of the best are making about $6 per day.\nBitmain has had the same miner for a long time. There has been no risk in owning this \"old tech\" for much longer than you'd own a server in a data center without any upgrades.\nSo, what does it all mean? Well, if the largest miners have already paid for their miners and infrastructure (which they have), then these miners can still be profitable at a bitcoin price of $7300.\nThe price is pulling towards $7300 right now. Some large miners will start to shut down, temporarily, at about $7000.\nI pay $0.00 per kwh for electricity because I built an off-grid, solar operation in the middle of the desert. And my exisiting miners have an average cost of $0 since I bought the miners over a year ago and I sold them after about 3 months of use (then I bought new ones from Bitmain). I'm NEVER gonna stop mining, regardless of price. But I only have about 1,000 miners. I think there are about 2 million miners currently working. I am not even noise on the network.\nBottom line: The majority of miners on the network are large miners. They aren't going to start turning off until about $6800-7000. I'm curious to see what happens if it drops to this level for a while. SUPER curious.\nsubmitted by /u/dan_from_san_diego\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:08:07.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41a3173b12d01a69be5cf2987f73efc9665434fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa_5CMyspgwLWS1TO1nYGiC7PbrMJ2j9Gv8kESH6Q2EhsT8PNvFir_XN", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Manipulation Highly Probable", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Manipulation Highly Probable", "published": "2018-05-28T20:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Crypto.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41a3173b12d01a69be5cf2987f73efc9665434fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa_5CMyspgwLWS1TO1nYGiC7PbrMJ2j9Gv8kESH6Q2EhsT8PNvFir_XN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Global Coin Report", "published": "2018-05-28T20:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Manipulation Highly Probable", "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) Manipulation Highly Probable May 28, 2018 506\nBitcoin (BTC) being the King of Crypto, generally dictates the direction the rest of the market will take. When BTC is fumbling in the market like in the current market times, every other coin and token also fumbles. This is because BTC dominates the total market capitalization by occupying 38.4% of the current total market cap of $326.6 Billion at the moment of writing this.\nA brief check on the history of BTC prices yields the King of Crypto had peaked on December 17th at a value of around $20,000. Coincidentally, this was just hours before the BTC futures started being offered by the CME group amidst lots of fanfare and delight of crypto-traders who saw this as a sign of crypto joining the mainstream of investing. However, a few traders were wary of Wallstreet getting into the business and warned that the ‘big shots’ in the big investment firms, will probably find a way to short BTC and any other crypto out there.\nCoincidentally, the value of BTC and the entire market capitalization started to depreciate after the CME Bitcoin futures started being offered. Not forgetting that the CME group was also joined by the CBOE in launching the futures on the same week.\nIt is no secret that plenty of traders have speculated manipulation. Besides, there is no regulation to protect against it in the crypto-verse in the first place. Therefore, it is a free for all or whoever has the might to orchestrate a market coup. These type of manipulations can only be done by institutional investors, large-scale traders and any other large entity that can do this.\nIf it is possible for the same institutional investors to manipulate Wallstreet with all its regulations, then the crypto-market would be stealing candy from a child for them. Such moves of manipulation have been popularized by Hollywood movies such as Wallstreet (1 & 2), The Big Short and Margin Call. One thing is usually the driving force of such manipulation, pure profits. And as the Wallstreet character known as Gordon Gekko once said, ‘Money never sleeps.’ The same fictional character was also quoted as saying that greed is good [in Wallstreet].\nTherefore, and with the above theory, it is highly likely that BTC has been the subject of manipulation all along.

Here are some VERY interesting facts:", "text": "I've been mining bitcoin for 30 months. Here are some VERY interesting facts:\n/u/dan_from_san_diego\nTl; Dr --- Just skip to the last paragraph.\nI have met with numerous large mining operations in the last two years (in the US, a few countries in Europe and China). I have seen a lot of different ways to set up mining centers.\nThe miners who pay the least in electricity pay about $0.03 per kwh. These are miners based in Washington State and some small operations in the European Alps. Both of these operations use hydro power.\nChinese miners pays about $0.04 per kwh. Some pay a little less and some pay a little more.\nSome miners are inefficient at cooling and some are very efficient. Using HVAC is the most expensive. The small operations in the Alps are using the natural cool air to cool their miners. This seems to be the most cost-effective. The next most cost-effective is liquid submersion cooling.\nNatural air-cooled mining centers are the cheapest to build. They basically just need fans to pull in the cool outside air and exhaust fans to exhaust it. These systems add about 5% in energy consumption for each miner.\nHVAC is pretty costly to purchase and adds about 25% in energy consumption to each miner.\nLiquid submersion cooling is very expensive to build but it is the most efficient. You can disconnect the cooling fans when the miner is submerged in liquid. This saves about 8% on energy usage per miner. So, liquid submersion cooling actually SAVES energy costs BUT it is crazy expensive to build.\nS9 miner = 0.00082 btc per day = $6 per day Cost of electricity for each S9 miner = $1.25 per day Cost of electricity for each air cooling for each S9 = $0.07 per day Cost of electricity for HVAC per S9 = $0.25 per day Cost of electricity for liquid cooling per S9 = $0 per day\nSo, the miners who pay $0.03 - $0.04 per kwh AND spent the millions on liquid submersion cooling are the miners who can remain running the longest when the price drops substantially.\nPeople feel that Bitmain h as a distinct advantage in mining because they build the miners AND they run them as well. I have determined that this is NOT an issue at all for large miners who purchased their systems prior to February, 2018. If you purchased your miners before the recent drop really kicked in (around February) then you could have sold them after purchasing for a profit of $1,000 (then you would, obviously, immediately re-purchase). This will put your cost of each miner in line with Bitmain. Thus...you are on even ground with them as a competitor.\nMost large miners bought their equipment and built their mining infrastructure when the price was rising. This means that most large miners are in VERY good positions because their infrastructure is likely paid off.\nSo, the best miners are currently making about $5 per day in profits for each miner. And the best of the best are making about $6 per day.\nBitmain has had the same miner for a long time. There has been no risk in owning this \"old tech\" for much longer than you'd own a server in a data center without any upgrades.\nSo, what does it all mean? Well, if the largest miners have already paid for their miners and infrastructure (which they have), then these miners can still be profitable at a bitcoin price of $7300.\nThe price is pulling towards $7300 right now. Some large miners will start to shut down, temporarily, at about $7000.\nI pay $0.00 per kwh for electricity because I built an off-grid, solar operation in the middle of the desert. And my exisiting miners have an average cost of $0 since I bought the miners over a year ago and I sold them after about 3 months of use (then I bought new ones from Bitmain). I'm NEVER gonna stop mining, regardless of price. But I only have about 1,000 miners. I think there are about 2 million miners currently working. I am not even noise on the network.\nBottom line: The majority of miners on the network are large miners. They aren't going to start turning off until about $6800-7000. I'm curious to see what happens if it drops to this level for a while. SUPER curious.\nsubmitted by /u/dan_from_san_diego\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:04:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "863626a9c1c5f203020244fda41641d63170b20e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrAIBl9XJDVqQWZkZ4N4yEkLLVDuzXn7fu4wZCEbMoKaicpAe8HjETt9KYLzmBS1HPtycELX7sam8z27Jh5kGx.64yxF1ODGgU2NrKcqap6N0GYOKZKDibsy6x0mOXrhY-", "site_full": "www.xrpchat.com", "site": "xrpchat.com", "site_section": "https://www.xrpchat.com/forum/17-xrp-trading-and-price-speculation/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Topics - Xrp Chat", "title": "Why is bitcoin dominance rising when all over market prices drop?", "title_full": "Why is bitcoin dominance rising when all over market prices drop? - Topics - Xrp Chat", "published": "2018-05-28T20:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.068, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/r263943/monthly_2017_07/facebook400px.png.94884468dbad12165c18e8b6b7a0e79a.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "863626a9c1c5f203020244fda41641d63170b20e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrAIBl9XJDVqQWZkZ4N4yEkLLVDuzXn7fu4wZCEbMoKaicpAe8HjETt9KYLzmBS1HPtycELX7sam8z27Jh5kGx.64yxF1ODGgU2NrKcqap6N0GYOKZKDibsy6x0mOXrhY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Madbull", "published": "2018-05-28T20:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why is bitcoin dominance rising when all over market prices drop?", "text": "Or should the question be: why are the all over market prices dropping when the bitcoin dominance rises?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T13:55:27.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4ded1e26a756bc01da3204835c3b2d827f0cc92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNKoCl.1k1a53LQfQaGvCMs8UhzkWH2.Cw4QfWfW6.2ovJe69yyBRseA--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "\"Bitcoin is the future....

When the first iPhone appeared, just over a decade ago, there were a grand total of 15 original apps.\nSince then, to say the industry has exploded would be a bit of an understatement. More than $70 billion has been paid out to app developers in the past decade, and the app market is expected to hit $188.9 billion in revenue by 2020. It is clearly a huge and fast-growing space, and recently we’ve seen a whole new area of the industry spring up: decentralized apps, or dApps.\nWith the onset of blockchain technology and the birth of the dApp, new potential was injected into the world of apps and software.\nThe market cap of cryptocurrencies is now more than $370 billion. If app developers can successfully harness this new technology, the potential could be truly exciting. But right now, both apps and dApps alike are struggling with some issues. It’s tough for users to manage an army of ordinary apps, each with individual subscriptions and without much interoperability.\nThe natural complexity of the young dApp industry can make these issues even harder. If dApps are to hit the mainstream, we need a new model. We need to bring apps and dApps together and build a space where users can move between them much more easily than they can right now.\nFirst, let’s take a more in-depth look at the current issues facing both traditional apps and their decentralized cousins. The Current Problems\nWith traditional apps, both users and developers are facing problems. Most people resent paying for apps today, so it’s tough for developers to make money by simply selling them for a one-off fee. As we move to a more cloud-based app market, subscription models are becoming the norm. This works well for developers because of the ongoing cost required to keep apps relevant and functional, but it’s not especially popular with customers. It forces them to manage multiple subscriptions and logins, which is a drain on time and money. This kind of model takes a lot of upkeep for everyone involved.\nWhat’s more, apps are too centralized. They’re siloed, without the possibility to integrate with other apps in most cases. Because of the difficulty involved in managing multiple separate apps (often with their own separate subscriptions), most people use less than five apps on a daily basis. Apps aren’t going anywhere, but due to these problems, most users aren’t interested in using more than a handful. It just isn’t worth the effort.\ndApps, on the other hand, have their own set of problems. They’re new and exciting, with enormous potential, but they’re also intimidating. Using multiple dApps means users have to hold a variety of different crypto tokens and navigate a range of different interfaces and platforms. It can be a real headache, and while the current generation of blockchain pioneers are happy to put in the effort, dApps need to shift to an easier model if they’re to go mainstream.\nThat model could involve bringing together apps and dApps using blockchain technology, benefiting both.\nBut how would something like that work? United by Blockchain\nTo make the app industry less fragmented and siloed, we need to tidy things up and make apps less centralized.\nBlockchain technology is perfect for this. It can be used to build a platform that brings apps and dApps together — bringing unity and decentralization to the heavily centralized app industry while providing better organization and utility for dApps.\nThis is what Cardstack is aiming to do.\nThe goal is to bridge the gap between blockchain-based dApps and original apps, allowing them to work together much more easily. In other words, Cardstack wants to break the silos and create a better user experience infrastructure.\nUsers can combine their favorite apps and services, picking the best of each to mix and match in a way that currently isn’t possible. Instead of a fragmented, disjointed collection of separate apps, they’ll be able to work with just one platform.\nThis is all based on the platform’s own CARD token. Users spend this to build smart contracts between themselves and the apps they want to use. The tokens are then distributed to the apps’ developers, who are rewarded fairly based on how much their apps are used.\nChris Tse, founder of CardStack, said:\nThe users are going need to use it, and right now only 0.1% of all users have ever used anything more than Coinbase in a blockchain way. We need the same adoption of mobile phones which is 60% of all human beings. We are building the user experience layer of the decentralized internet. Chris Tse introduces Cardstack\nThe early blockchain-based apps that we’ve seen so far have a tendency to be a little clunky and slow, as they require every single user action to be submitted on-chain.\nCardstack wants to avoid this with their own Tally system, which deals with a lot of processes off-chain using cryptographic proof-of-value messages. It’s much quicker and puts less strain on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nThis allows for many more transactions to take place, bringing power and usability to dApps on a scale we haven’t seen before.\n“This way, decentralization will not lead to fragmentation which is unusable. We’re trying to make this space cohesive, yet decentralized,” Chris adds.\nMaking dApps more accessible, bringing them into contact with original apps, and increasing the amount they can do together will go a long way towards bringing about the mass adoption of blockchain. If done right, there’s an incredible amount of potential ahead.\nDo you think that blockchain is the key to bridging apps and dApps?

BTC\\/USD must remain above $7,000 to avoid a sharp decline. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nThere were a couple of rejections noted around $7,500 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair started a downside move and declined below the $7,400 and $7,300 support levels. It even settled below the $7,400 pivot and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined below the $7,260 low. \\n\nThe current price action suggests a downside break below $7,260 with a bearish angle. At the moment, the price is testing the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high. If the price breaks the $7,150 level, there could be more losses towards the $7,000 level. The 1.618 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high is at $7,020 to act as a support. Further below this, the price could decline towards $6,800. On the upside, there are two bearish trend lines formed with resistances at $7,400 and $7,510 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price may struggle to break the $7,300 and $7,400 resistance levels.

Most people are already somewhat familiar with Bitcoin (BTC) , which is the first and biggest crypto to this day. However, there are many, many more of them out there, some of which can serve as more than decent BTC alternatives. Let’s list some of them, and see what they can offer. Litecoin (LTC)\nLitecoin is often described as silver to Bitcoin’s gold. It is a currency that first appeared in 2011, and it is among the first ones to appear after BTC. LTC was created by a former Google engineer and an MIT graduate, Charlie Lee, and it is based on an open-source network for global payments. It is decentralized, meaning that it does not have a central authority, and is known for using scrypt as its proof-of-work.\nConsidering the fact that it appeared so soon after BTC, it shares many similarities with this currency. What makes it different, however, is a much faster rate of block generation. This also allows for faster transactions, which is a useful feature that has inspired many to start adopting LTC as a part of their business practices. Its current value is $122.10 per coin. Ethereum (ETH)\nEthereum is a much younger crypto that was launched back in 2015. It is basically a decentralized software platform, and it allows for the creation of dApps and Smart Contracts. Thanks to these products, issues like fraud, downtime, interference, or control from some third party is completely eliminated.\nBefore ETH’s official launch, Ethereum has a pre-sale which had a much bigger response than anyone would have expected. Its token is called Ether, and it allows its holders to easily navigate Ethereum’s platform, which is why app developers who wish to use this platform make the majority of ETH holders.\nAfter a cyber attack from 2016, Ethereum had to split, which led to the creation of another altcoin, Ethereum Classic (ETC). ETH’s current price is $602.78 , while ETC’s price is $15.75 . Verge (XVG)\nVerge is yet another crypto that was inspired by Bitcoin, and it even used BTC’s original blockchain, which it improved for its own purposes. Those purposes include providing its users with an efficient and fast decentralized way to make transactions directly. Its goal is to allow the users to keep their privacy, and give them flexible options when it comes to sending and receiving payments.\nTo achieve such levels of privacy, Verge uses networks that provide anonymity, like 12P and Tor. That way, it can successfully hide its users’ IP addresses, and keep their transactions untraceable. As for its price, it is currently at $0.041980 . Ripple (XRP)\nRipple is a crypto that was developed and launched in 2012 by the Ripple company. This company has a complete ownership and control over this currency, which makes it impossible for anyone to actually mine it. The only way to get Ripple is to buy it from a trading platform. This level of control, as well as multiple products that provide its users with quick and safe payments, has made Ripple one of favorite cryptos among the banks.\nFinancial institutions have discovered its potential, which has inspired them to adopt it and use its technology to improve their own businesses. Ripple, of course, accepted, which allowed it to gain more exposure, influence, and users. Its price is at $0.623194 . Dash\nDash is a crypto that appeared in January 2014 under the name of Darkcoin, and is mostly described as Bitcoin’s more secretive version. Obviously, it was inspired by BTC, but it offers much more anonymity than BTC. It works on a mastercode network that is completely decentralized, and it allows for untraceable transactions.\nDue to its nature, it became very popular very quickly, and it can be mined by anyone by using GPU or CPU. Its name was changed from Darkcoin to Dash in 2015, but it kept all of its original technological features. Its current price is at $338.29 .\nDespite the fact that BTC is the biggest and the best-known crypto within the online world, there are still many currencies that can be used as its alternatives. Most of them offer a better deal when it comes to privacy or fees, which is not surprising considering that they managed to build on the foundation that BTC itself has set.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The interior hashes do not need to be stored.\nA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.\nWith computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.\n. . .

People coming from all over the world speaking languages of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

People coming from all over the world speaking languages of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued.

People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper.

People coming from all over the world speaking languages of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point.

The energy consumption for the crypto-currency is higher than the consumption of smaller Nations such as Denmark or Ireland. Environmentalists beat the dumbfounded hands above the head. But the reality is so grim, as you would like us to believe? The Proof-of-Work as a mechanism for consensus\nThe Proof-Of-Work (POW) is at the heart of Satoshi Nakamoto proposed system. He ensures the integrity and read-only nature of the network. The task of the miner is, transactions from the network (the so-called Mem-Pool), to create a so-called Canditate Block, and then by the count-up of a so-called Nonce to create a Root Hash that starts with a certain number of 0-bits.\nKeys we on, what is described in the above paragraph: a Block that contains transactions from the Bitcoin network as a valid or true, is considered, it must meet certain criteria. On the one hand, he must contain the Root Hash of the previous block. On the other side his own Root Hash must start with a certain number of 0-bits. Root hash, Difficulty and energy consumption\nThe Root Hash is the result, if it rehashes all the Block contained in the data (i.e., the transactions, the block number, the Root Hash of its predecessor, Nonce, etc.) with a SHA-256 function. A completely random string of letters and Numbers. The special case of a Hash function is that for each Change of the Inputs a completely new Output. Therefore, there is the Nonce as a Variable in a Candiate Block. Due to the high of the Nonce count, it always creates a new Root Hash, to satisfy the requirements of the network.\nThe Difficulty (i.e., difficulty) is changed depending on the computing power of all the participants in the network. Every 2016 blocks the difficulty of this performance, so the network takes place in average every 10 minutes a new Block. The Difficulty indicates how many 0-bits must appear at the beginning of a Root hash. The more 0-bits are required, the more difficult it is to find a suitable Root Hash.\nThe Root Hash for a Block for example looks like this:\n1fc7ec89c5e0b6a9a499a0a8a41397bd180be508b937ed\nMeets the Root, the criterion of 0-bits, which is defined by the difficulty of the network Hash all miners to recognize this Block as valid, paste it into your locally stored Version of the Blockchain and use it as a base to Calculate the next Root hash. You can find such a Hash only by Rates and this Rates is the cost of computing power and hence energy. The chain (the Blockchain) with the most accumulated POW is regarded by the network as the real chain.\nIn short: The POW represents proven energy output. 51% of attacks, and immutability\nThe POW, plays the Central role in the Consensus process of the decentralized Bitcoin network. The Miner must communicate only minimally with each other and are even in competition with each other. However, they all adhere to the Protocol rules, since the blocks that did not receive the correct criteria, are rejected from the network. So all play by the same rules without a Central authority compelled.\nGenerally speaking, an attacker is able to manipulate, thanks to the Private-Key/Public-Key cryptography, only his own transactions (i.e., Double-Spending). He would like to do this, he needs to muster more computing power than the Rest of the network. This is called also a 51% attack. The more computing power the network has, the more expensive this attack is. The more it is manipulated the end of the transaction, the less likely it is for the attacker to modify the transaction in the Block and to create quickly enough blocks to get the longest chain.\nIn addition, it is a certain number of blocks physically impossible, so much energy to devote to the Bitcoin Blockchain to change. A transaction that is “only” six blocks back, therefore, as immutable. Energy consumption and environmental protection\nThe Bitcoin network so it requires energy to find a consensus about the reality of the current State of all transactions. It is this fact that secures the network.\nThe Argument of the environmentalists is that Bitcoin to spend a lot of energy to smoke like a small nation-state, therefore, our environment, destroy, and overall bad for humanity. But it misses this way of looking at the fundamental property of Bitcoin, Because the Bitcoin Blockchain is an immutable Ledger of a decentralized network.\nThis achievement, by Satoshi Nakamoto, for the first time in 2008, as described, represents a revolutionary step. The energy must be used up, so that the network can, without a Central authority to require that the current state of the stock decides to book.\nIn addition, it is in the economic interest of the Miner, the energy cost for your computer be kept as low as possible. So one could argue as well that the energy consumption in Bitcoin is an economic incentive for the development of affordable (and sustainable) energy sources. Bitcoin enables previously impossible\nAn immutable, decentralized Ledger like the Bitcoin Blockchain is an innovation for our world and offers a number of advantages for the whole of humanity (think of the Slogan: Banking the Unbanked ). The consumption of energy is not a Design flaw, but an essential part. It allows the users to operate without trust.

A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation – in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome.\nThe mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said. Egypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s … accepted by a group of people …. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,” Adeyemi said. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.- Reuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:38:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8007990eb129af49e620a94f1ea4d1a158b824fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DsoWwvdICsaGE0XNMkmhKPmQ8Wk.1lv6JkaPzO7weCTH1Sy.pZwNUYFb0p9xMWIS7BJTlYn8fYFSlvcUkcBcdl_KbwXKuKyn8QdDVgdMZlxmtmu_mGHC_pkVVfe1OPBtArTMjttcJETXpyIFe2Gmg", "site_full": "www.themountainherald.com", "site": "themountainherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.themountainherald.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Mountain Herald", "title": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to $1", "title_full": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to $1", "published": "2018-05-28T19:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8007990eb129af49e620a94f1ea4d1a158b824fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DsoWwvdICsaGE0XNMkmhKPmQ8Wk.1lv6JkaPzO7weCTH1Sy.pZwNUYFb0p9xMWIS7BJTlYn8fYFSlvcUkcBcdl_KbwXKuKyn8QdDVgdMZlxmtmu_mGHC_pkVVfe1OPBtArTMjttcJETXpyIFe2Gmg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-28T19:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to $1", "text": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to $1 May 28 Print This Article Share it With Friends On May 8, 2018, Dubai Business Bay, the famous world’s tallest hotel – JW Marriott Marquis Hotel, International Blockchain Economic Conference was held here.The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars.

And when saying that Decred is the new Bitcoin, it’s not as a “silver standard” like Litecoin. Decred is coming to be the Bitcoin 2.0 we need.\nBesides having a relatively similar history and being developed by the team which developed the btcsuite, we could also say that DCR is a coin which serves for the same purpose like Satoshi’s does, and shares most of its good qualities, but added with some tweaks a lot of people thought were essential. Decred’s core fundamentals were actually based on an opinion piece published in 2015 outlining Bitcoin’s biggest challenges: governance, funding and powerful miners having too much influence on the blockchain. All of these three problems are solved with Decred’s clever hybrid consensus system.\nThat said, autonomy can be said to be the core of their mission. There is no central authority for decision making, as stakeholders are the ones who set the rules through voting, in a process which is intricated to their hybrid mining-validation system which is, yes, another main feature of Decred. We’ve seen voting before – some platforms like BitShares and Ark have a dPoS system, but the case is totally different in Decred.\nDecred Tickets\nHybrid PoW/PoS system\nDecred blockchain both employ miners create blocks and validators to validate them, creating a hybrid PoS/PoW ledger, though the validator staking system doesn’t work quite, in the same manner, it does in any usual PoS blockchain, like Cardano.\nBlocks are mined as usual. Then, stakeholders lock some DCR to buy a “ticket” to put on some block created. 5 tickets are randomly chosen to validate each new block mined and if 3 of them are staked for the block, then it’s added to the chain. Tickets are selected to vote with an average time of 28 days. When mined and validated, 30 coins are rewarded, 60% going to miners, 30% to validators (voters) and 10% to Decred development subsidy.\nVoting\nTickets can also be used to vote for or against proposed changes on the Blockchain. Votes are direct and not on delegates like on dPoS systems. They happen naturally. When a change is proposed, 95% of the 1000 new blocks created must have the latest block version (consistent with the upgrade) and 75% of the of the votes cast within a 2016 block interval must have the latest vote version. Then there’s the actual voting. After a Rule Change Interval (RCI – when 8064 blocks are created), stakeholders cast a “yes”, “no” vote or abstain. Then, the rules are: if there’s more than 90% abstentions or less than 75% majority of “yes” or “no” non-abstaining votes, the agenda will remain active for the next RCI; if 75% of the votes are positive, the change will be implemented in an RCI period; If 75% are negative, the agenda will never activate, the same happens if it the voting reaches its expiration date without a 75% “yes” or “no” majority.\nA hard fork happens when a new consensus change is decided. Decred’s code is built to be prepared for several changes and additions. Implementing features necessary for the Lightning Network is an example of a voting which occurred in Decred’s voting dashboard.\nFeatures of a hybrid Blockchain\nThis new mining-validation system allows profiting both from mining and staking. While still heavily ASIC-relying, sometimes staking pools or even running solo nodes will be more profitable than mining, leaving both people which can contribute with hashing capability for mining new coins and stakeholders with something to gain.\nIt’s evident how it solves those three fundamental problems mentioned before: in Decred, miners’ power over decisions is limited both because they share the block rewards with validators and because any changes have to be literally voted by the stakeholders. Leaving some of the block’s subsidy to Decred’s development also solves the funding problem. It’s no wonder why it’s growing so nimbly.\nWith all essential features which make Bitcoin the #1 coin and a similar recent history and dev team, but with a brilliant system which puts PoS in PoW, Decred is the best of both worlds. Or maybe, if time will tell, it’s the best in the world.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Decred’s core fundamentals were actually based on an opinion piece published in 2015 outlining Bitcoin’s biggest challenges: governance, funding and powerful miners having too much influence on the blockchain. All of these three problems are solved with Decred’s clever hybrid consensus system.\nThat said, autonomy can be said to be the core of their mission. There is no central authority for decision making, as stakeholders are the ones who set the rules through voting, in a process which is intricated to their hybrid mining-validation system which is, yes, another main feature of Decred. We’ve seen voting before – some platforms like BitShares and Ark have a dPoS system, but the case is totally different in Decred.\nDecred Tickets\nHybrid PoW/PoS system\nDecred blockchain both employ miners create blocks and validators to validate them, creating a hybrid PoS/PoW ledger, though the validator staking system doesn’t work quite, in the same manner, it does in any usual PoS blockchain, like Cardano.\nBlocks are mined as usual. Then, stakeholders lock some DCR to buy a “ticket” to put on some block created. 5 tickets are randomly chosen to validate each new block mined and if 3 of them are staked for the block, then it’s added to the chain. Tickets are selected to vote with an average time of 28 days. When mined and validated, 30 coins are rewarded, 60% going to miners, 30% to validators (voters) and 10% to Decred development subsidy.\nVoting\nTickets can also be used to vote for or against proposed changes on the Blockchain. Votes are direct and not on delegates like on dPoS systems. They happen naturally. When a change is proposed, 95% of the 1000 new blocks created must have the latest block version (consistent with the upgrade) and 75% of the of the votes cast within a 2016 block interval must have the latest vote version. Then there’s the actual voting. After a Rule Change Interval (RCI – when 8064 blocks are created), stakeholders cast a “yes”, “no” vote or abstain. Then, the rules are: if there’s more than 90% abstentions or less than 75% majority of “yes” or “no” non-abstaining votes, the agenda will remain active for the next RCI; if 75% of the votes are positive, the change will be implemented in an RCI period; If 75% are negative, the agenda will never activate, the same happens if it the voting reaches its expiration date without a 75% “yes” or “no” majority.\nA hard fork happens when a new consensus change is decided. Decred’s code is built to be prepared for several changes and additions. Implementing features necessary for the Lightning Network is an example of a voting which occurred in Decred’s voting dashboard.\nFeatures of a hybrid Blockchain\nThis new mining-validation system allows profiting both from mining and staking. While still heavily ASIC-relying, sometimes staking pools or even running solo nodes will be more profitable than mining, leaving both people which can contribute with hashing capability for mining new coins and stakeholders with something to gain.\nIt’s evident how it solves those three fundamental problems mentioned before: in Decred, miners’ power over decisions is limited both because they share the block rewards with validators and because any changes have to be literally voted by the stakeholders. Leaving some of the block’s subsidy to Decred’s development also solves the funding problem. It’s no wonder why it’s growing so nimbly.\nWith all essential features which make Bitcoin the #1 coin and a similar recent history and dev team, but with a brilliant system which puts PoS in PoW, Decred is the best of both worlds. Or maybe, if time will tell, it’s the best in the world.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation – in bitcoin.The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said.Egypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision.\"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's … accepted by a group of people …. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters.The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).CommentsMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.© Thomson Reuters 2018(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

And where Bitcoin fits in", "text": "Pretty much everyone uses money\nEverybody.\nWe work for it, grind for it, speculate wildly on shitcoins the next big thing in disruptive tokenized decentralized blockchain technology for it – so what is it?\nBy now we know better to say “Dollars/Euros/Yuan, duh.” In fact, a question that was already complicated has become even more so with the invention of new, improved forms of digital currencies that we’re using as assets, stores value, and methods of payment. So cryptocurrencies are money, right?\nThat’s the question. What does our society consider money? What makes it tick? Why do you want it? (Where can I get some? Do you have any?!) Characteristics of Money 1) Money is a medium of exchange\nPeople throughout the ages have used so many different things as money it’ll make your head spin. Rai stones , shells, beads, bones, bracelets, clay tablets, metal coins, paper notes… and arguably, digital information in the form fo cryptocurrency.\nA characteristic of money is that it allows people to exchange goods and services. Let’s say we’re living in the distant past. Nope, even further\nI have a pig I want to sell, and you want to buy. Money doesn’t exist yet, so we’re going to have to make do with barter. You have two items to trade with: a fancy sword that took hundreds of hours to make (too much to trade for a pig!) and a basket of fruit (what do I look like, an idiot?)\nIt’s a dilemma. I want to sell my pig, but what am I gonna do, take the fruit basket? Do I break your sword and give you back the “change”? It doesn’t work out, and the only way to make a sale is either for someone to make a massive compromise or for more people or items to get involved so we can trade more goods until the value balances out fairly.\nThat, of course, is where money comes in. The local chiefs, or whoever, get together and decide that shells or whatever are worth something, and because they’re small, portable, and abundant, we can use them to represent pigs and swords and fruit and so on. Plus, the chiefs totally found a huge stash of shells before they made that call, so they’re game. Premining 101, amiright? 2) Money is A Store of Value\nOf course, to say the local chiefs get together and decide that money is worth something is a massive simplification – it’s truer to say that society needs to believe that something is valuable. That’s what makes it valuable, which is kind of a catch 22. What makes society believe something is valuable? Other people deciding that it’s valuable. What makes those people decide it’s valuable?\nUnless enough people agree, it’s not money, and I’m sure the debates around cowry shells and gold were heated and long-lasting as society bickered over whether or not something constituted a valuable item. Sound familiar?\nA store of value doesn’t just refer to something that can be traded instantly for goods to make things easier. The fruit wouldn’t work at all, for example – it’s only good for a few days. Money needs to hold value for a long time (indefinitely, really) in order to be considered valuable, which is another hot topic surrounding the issue of cryptocurrencies. 3) Money is immutable\nThat means it’s hard to counterfeit, because after all…\nIt’s a temptation.\nMoney can’t be changed, altered, or counterfeited, otherwise it doesn’t work out at all. Of course, governments print off their own fiat money all the time, change the design, the form, etc – but that’s because they make the rules, and society generally operates by agreeing to live within those rules.\nCertain proponents of cryptocurrency see it not just as a cool store of value, but a genuine threat to the status quo, enabling people to create their own money in a fair manner with no need for oversight. Blockchain technology allows us to prove immutability, that there’s no counterfeiting or double spending, and that nobody behind the scenes is hoarding huge unfair amounts for themselves.\nWe’ve already mentioned that it needs to be portable – two more. It needs to be a unit of account , meaning it can be expressed clearly and measured in a way that makes trading easy. No “how many fractions of a pig is that fruit basket worth exactly?”. It also needs to be a standard of deferred payment , meaning that if I loan you the money it can be returned in the future in a way that’s acceptable to me.\nNo, I don’t want that three-month-old apple I loaned you. It’s cool… you keep it. How do these characteristics apply to Bitcoin?\nHere we go – brass tacks. Is Bitcoin money based on those identifiers?\nIt’s a medium exchange, most definitely. Over $5 million worth of Bitcoin was traded in the last 24 hours just on exchanges, let alone OTC trading done by whales. People can argue till the cows come home that it’s not a good investment, it’s not an asset class, etc, but if you can sell it for money and millions are traded daily then it’s a medium of exchange.\nIs it a store of value ? Debatable. Personally, I think it is. Major banks are investing in Bitcoin and opening Bitcoin trading desks, and there’s a finite supply, meaning it ought to deflate in value compared to fiat currency which is inflationary.\nOught to . Nobody really knows how to value Bitcoin, and people argue that it’s overvalued, undervalued, and so on. It’s difficult to say for sure whether it’s a good long-term store of value, but given the fact that it’s steadily increased by many thousands of percent over the last ten years and the supply is only getting more limited, I think you can draw your own conclusions.\nImmutable ? Yes. The whole damn point is that people can’t mess with the ledger, and can’t alter the code of the Bitcoin network. You can’t “hack” in there and start creating new or fake coins unless you control over half the network, and while it’s not as decentralized as it could be , I don’t think there’s a serious risk of that at the moment.\nIt’s so portable that you can store it in a subdermal implant under your skin if you’re crazy enough, or on a piece of paper, or even in your head if you have the memory for it. Billions of dollars can be expressed with a string of numbers and letters. Portable AF.\nA unit of account? That’s a tricky one! In fact, I think we can get into whether it’s a unit of account and a deferred method of payment in one go. The issue in both cases is price volatility.\nCan Bitcoin be easily expressed as a unit of currency? It’s not the most user friendly currency in the world, but once you think of the value in numerary form it can be counted just like fiat. It’s a little more tech-orientated, but not too complicated. As a deferred method of payment, well… on one hand, who wouldn’t want to be loan someone money that’s only going to increase in value, right?\nOn the other hand, who the hell knows what Bitcoin is going to do really. It has yet to linger on a low for too long, but the incredible volatility makes it very unreliable to use for lending, which is probably the main argument I could make against it being a valid form of money. But enough about me – what do you think?\nIs Bitcoin money? How many fruit baskets will 1 BTC be worth in six months?\nLet us know in the comments below! What makes money…“money”?

investment scam has threatened to sue, unless the priority crime investigating unit retracts its statement.\nLawyers representing BitCaw Trading stated on Monday that the company was not aligned to BTC Global, as the Hawks claimed in their media release on Friday.\nThe lawyers said that BTC Global was a “completely separate entity”.\nThis comes after the Hawks announced that BitCaw Trading and BTC Global were the same company , and were being jointly investigated for a scam that may have fleeced up to 28 000 investors out of R1-billion.\n“BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third party money or offer any kind of investment returns,” states the letter. “BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a Bitcoin Investment company and has nothing to do with our client.”\nThe lawyer’s letter further states that should the Hawks not retract their contention that the two companies are one and the same, and post the retraction by close of business on Tuesday, “our instructions are to approach the South Gauteng High Court on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients’ rights”.\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin: a pocketful of cryptonite\nHawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi told Fin24 that the Hawks had received the letter of demand from BitCaw Trading, but said that because the investigations were ongoing, the Hawks would rather wait for the courts to decide if they had erred, than retract their statement prematurely.\n“We got the letter. We knew that they would go to the media. We will take it on in line with the due process. We believe that it is good that people want this to be clarified by the courts, and we will handle it there. As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise,” said Mulaudzi.\nREAD MORE: ICOs: the lawless land of cryptocurrency fundraising\nMulaudzi told Fin24 that the Hawks had sufficient evidence to support their statements regarding the matter.\nHe said the company’s rights would be protected if they had indeed been aggrieved. However, he added, the Hawks would not compromise on pursuing justice for the victims said to have been swindled by the business.\n“This is not something we are prepared to be swayed on. You have up to 28 000 victims who have already approached the Hawks. What about them? If we don’t look after them, who are we supposed look after?

A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices.\nWeekly chart The first weekly close below the 50-week MA in nearly three years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, while the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover.\nClearly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the marketplace. Thus, a minor corrective rally could be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal).\nView BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425. An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800â$8,000. Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.
