The Litecoin one is best to start as it‚Äôs the cheapest and most popular so I‚Äôll give you the details for that one specifically and if you want to try out the other 2 at a later stage just let me know and I‚Äôll give you the link for those too.\nSo the litecoin bot is really simple. You make an investment of however much you like , the minimum is 0.1LTC which is only about $19.. the investment runs for 99 days and you earn 1.4% back each day which is paid out every 6 hours in 4 increments of 0.35%. Once your balance reaches 0.1 you can then withdraw or ‚Äúreinvest‚Äù which then means you have 2 investments earning for you. So for an example if you have 10 investments total you will earn 40 earnings every day. The trick to this program is to compound as much as you can. The more you compound your investments the more you will earn. It‚Äôs really easy to set it up, withdrawals are instant and the customer support is fantastic.

on Thursday, reaching down to the bottom of the hammer from the previous session. This suggests to me that we are going to reach towards the $8000 level just below. That‚Äôs an area that has been very important in the past, and I think that market participants could get involved at that area. However, if we are to break down below the $7900 level, the market will more than likely unravel rather significantly. I believe that we are starting to see even more bearish pressure, as bitcoin can‚Äôt seem to get out of its own way. If we break out to the upside, I think there is plenty of resistance near the $9000 level. It looks to me like the market is starting to rollover rather significantly. This will be exacerbated by a strengthening US dollar overall. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin also fell against the Japanese yen, reaching down towards the ¬•900,000 level, an area that has been support and resistance in the past. If we can break down below the ¬•900,000 level, it‚Äôs likely that we will try to reach down towards the ¬•800,000 level. Below there, I think it‚Äôs only a matter time before we test ¬•700,000, mainly because it is the bottom of the overall consolidation area that the market has been in, going back to the beginning to the you. I believe that we are essentially in the ‚Äúfair value‚Äù range of the overall consolidation, so I think that the volatility in this area could continue, but ultimately I think we will continue the downward pressure as we have made a ‚Äúlower high‚Äù recently. If we break down below the ¬•700,000 level, this market unwinds rather drastically. \\n\\n\n\\n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:43:53.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d28463fa105d0ba5526941ad17822eb186c9e9e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmenAVg60VL85Y5gb26gu_lA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin Volatility", "title_full": "Bitcoin Volatility", "published": "2018-05-19T01:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d28463fa105d0ba5526941ad17822eb186c9e9e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmenAVg60VL85Y5gb26gu_lA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Harley29", "published": "2018-05-19T01:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Volatility", "text": "Quote: from: Hellokitty09 on May 12, 2018, 07:21:15 PM Quote: from: Albert211994 on February 17, 2018, 04:10:42 PM What is the key factor that would totally eradicate the volatility of bitcoin?\nIs it the price? The higher the price the less likely it would be manipulated.\nOr the distribution of supply of bitcoin? More people holding bitcoin, the harder for the whale to move the price.\nWhat do you think?\nThe basic economic law of supply and demand. When there's so much demand for bitcoin in the market, the price shoots up and then vice versa. That's one major factor why the price is so volatile that it can change in a matter of minutes. Another factor I can see that is the news, positive and negative news drove the price to go down and up. However, if you look at the bright side, volatility has its advantage as well specially for daily traders. Most of them takes advantages of the wild price swings and uses their TA go look for opportunities. Price volatility can cause irritation to most of us, but if you look at the positive of it, anyone of us can take advantage and make a lot of profits.\nHow can it be controlled? I have one suggestion, the controllers should fix a limit for one investor so that he cannot be able to hold big quantity, but I think it will also not work. The distribution of supply is the main problem and whales have eaten big part of bitcoin supply. Till date there is no way to control manipulation of market and this huge volatility in the price.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T11:49:02.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "091a89ab2674ca8126dbe94da233fe2f3051aac8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtEsqYMHuqWGmfwiZXPYPbKbfRDTGJWOAfIdfJO8qnUH9wNyn_dXMfSpSjVwoCKrVcaorhr7nTsI0y0iCzRIecVhRqe4T.HbwE4-", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed/", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain MMA Fighter Mei Yamaguchi Comes Out Swinging for Bitcoin.com", "title_full": "#Blockchain MMA Fighter Mei Yamaguchi Comes Out Swinging for Bitcoin.com", "published": "2018-05-19T01:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/431-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "091a89ab2674ca8126dbe94da233fe2f3051aac8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtEsqYMHuqWGmfwiZXPYPbKbfRDTGJWOAfIdfJO8qnUH9wNyn_dXMfSpSjVwoCKrVcaorhr7nTsI0y0iCzRIecVhRqe4T.HbwE4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-19T01:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain MMA Fighter Mei Yamaguchi Comes Out Swinging for Bitcoin.com", "text": "#Blockchain MMA Fighter Mei Yamaguchi Comes Out Swinging for Bitcoin.com Posted on by Startup365\nOn May 18, 2018, the One Championship fighter, female mixed martial artist (MMA) Mei Yamaguchi sponsored by Bitcoin.com, faced the Atomweight World Champion Angela Lee in a re-match bout called ‚ÄòUnstoppable Dreams.‚Äô\nAlso read: US State Issues Emergency Cease and Desist Orders to Two Crypto Investment Firms Japanese MMA Veteran Mei Yamaguchi Enters the Ring Sporting Bitcoin.com Gear\nThis Friday the Bitcoin.com sponsored Japanese veteran MMA fighter Mei Yamaguchi to meet her adversary Angela Lee again, in the the mixed martial artist female championship bout of the year at the One Championship Arena in Singapore .

Some sources claim it is just fine, whereas others deem is not viable for much longer. Alex De Vries conducted an interesting piece of research, which claims the energy usage by Bitcoin miners will double by late 2018. \\u00a0An interesting study, although one that also misses out on key elements . \\n The Alex De Vries Study \\n\nLooking at how Bitcoin mining evolved, it is normal the energy usage has been on the rise. More people are excited about mining cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the efficiency of mining units has improved vastly. As such, one would expect the energy usage to remain somewhat stable. Alex De Vries claims that will be anything but the case. In his findings, BTC mining will use as much energy as the entire country of The Netherlands. \\n\nHis research also claims how this energy consumption will continue to rise. It may even reach 5% of the world‚Äôs energy. On paper, this sounds very problematic, although there are always two sides to a story. There are some key factors which contribute to making Bitcoin mining profitable. The first of all is having access to electricity that is affordable and cheap. For Bitcoin mining purposes, the number of locations is fairly limited in this regard. \\n\nCanada, Iceland, and some regions of the US are places that come to mind in this regard. China also has some ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù electricity rates, but the country is trying to move mining firms out of the region. This factor is seemingly not taken into account by Alex De Vries. Bitcoin mining has become something for corporations rather than individual miners. These companies are also looking to keep their electricity usage in check first and foremost. \\n The Rise of Renewable Energy \\n\nAnother factor Alex De Vries overlooked is the use of renewable energy . All regions mentioned above have a high degree of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin mining operations are tapping into those solutions rather than the traditional power grid. One could even argue the focus on renewable energy makes the entire study by Alex De Vries a trivial issue. \\n\nNo one denies the Bitcoin mining industry will continue to require more electricity. With the mining difficulty rising, more hardware is needed or new units will need to be developed which are even better at this process while keeping the energy consumption low. It is unclear if more robust units can be expected in this regard. Even so, existing hardware combined with renewable energy sources will not affect the world‚Äôs energy consumption all that much. \\n\nThere are bigger threats to our environment than Bitcoin mining. It is a slight concern, but most of these studies tend to overlook all of the necessary information. Alex De Vries highlights some interesting aspects, but they are based on partial information and a few assumptions. This research will have no real impact on the popularity of Bitcoin or mining whatsoever. \\n\nThe post Study Claims Bitcoin Mining is Hurting the Environment, Flawed Argument appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:30:12.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16beaa433d3f64f6546acb20f828501c99b632ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNH7FT7x.IGbG17ZlKeybzxWBJnu1jcip4dr5AGnkpJWs4vy.wmfW0oQabQffgtubLLm_X6iWZDCbkvUXepBHbmUCIILWonoSHQ--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move", "published": "2018-05-19T01:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.055, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16beaa433d3f64f6546acb20f828501c99b632ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNH7FT7x.IGbG17ZlKeybzxWBJnu1jcip4dr5AGnkpJWs4vy.wmfW0oQabQffgtubLLm_X6iWZDCbkvUXepBHbmUCIILWonoSHQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-19T01:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move above the $1,350 resistance and declined sharply against the US Dollar. \\n There is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair is currently correcting higher, but it may face many barriers on the upside near $1,240-50. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is under pressure below $1,300 against the US Dollar.

The price traded towards $1,340 where sellers appeared and protected more upsides. As a result, the price started a fresh downside move and declined back below $1,300.

However, there are many hurdles on the upside for buyers near $1,220-50. There is also a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low is near $1,248 to act as a resistance. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly under bearish pressure below $1,250.

The full extension is located at $4,680.7. \\n\nRSI is pointing down to signal that sellers are in control of the game and could take bitcoin price for further losses. Stochstic is also heading south but is dipping into oversold levels to reflect some exhaustion and hint at a possible return in bullish momentum. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nIf the 38.2% extension is enough to keep losses at bay, bitcoin could still have a shot at forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This would be a classic reversal signal, hinting that price is done with the drop and that a longer-term uptrend is in the works. Price has yet to break past the neckline at $10,000 for this to happen though. \\n\nIt would take a really strong market catalyst to spur such a strong climb, especially since the $10,000 handle has held as a ceiling for quite some time. So far, investors seem more cautious on the rejection at key inflection points. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Revisiting the Downside Targets appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:30:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "885300412b168e3279addb977fa1e55c5692663d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNOhFI2MTh8rEluJmRBAECGGG0_pxSwgjVJszFT_8ZUrDzR5Ghbw8HM_jf7dJ3tdtR.fIQNQ7PzyYw0CI4zrgD0qrGqBM1MdZyw--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price declined and broke", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price declined and broke", "published": "2018-05-19T01:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "885300412b168e3279addb977fa1e55c5692663d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNOhFI2MTh8rEluJmRBAECGGG0_pxSwgjVJszFT_8ZUrDzR5Ghbw8HM_jf7dJ3tdtR.fIQNQ7PzyYw0CI4zrgD0qrGqBM1MdZyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-19T01:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price declined and broke", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price declined and broke a key support level at $8,200 against the US Dollar. \\n There was a break below a triangle pattern with support at $8,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but it could face resistance near $8,150 and $8,250. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar.

At night the powergrid would overload. The only way to sustain the mining requirements are coal and nuclear plants.\nFortunately, this isn't really a big issue:\n1) you can distribute your mining plants on several sites on Earth, using daylight on different longitudes. This would obviously increase the incidence of hardware costs in the profit equation, but at good sites with high insolation you would have also smaller electricity costs than grid-connected farms.\n2) there are solar electricity generation methods like \" concentrated solar power \" providing the possibility to store energy so they can also work at night. The Andasol plants I mentioned, for example, work with this principle.\n3) if CSP isn't possible, batteries may be an option - their costs are also falling.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:44:01.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19dca7ec1bbe4f2edb5d2a9dc46da9d02c557006", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhHUrDwyLsu8XiMLFLYCM.kI-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-19T01:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19dca7ec1bbe4f2edb5d2a9dc46da9d02c557006", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhHUrDwyLsu8XiMLFLYCM.kI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-19T01:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ‚ãÖ May 18, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Poised for $9000s Amid Weak Lows Bitcoin Magazine Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The net short dollar position has declined for four straight weeks.\nU.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.\nIn a wider measure of dollar positioning 0#NETUSDFX= that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position equivalent to $11.02 billion, down from $13.31 billion the previous week.\nThat was the lowest net short dollar positioning in four months.\nSince mid-April, the dollar has rallied by more than 5 percent, underpinned by rising U.S. Treasury yields and solid economic data that puts the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least two more times this year.\nHowever, Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities, believes the dollar's rally should prove temporary, although he said for now there is further room for the greenback to extend its gains.\nBut he expects that once global economic trends become more stable and major foreign central banks start signaling they would adjust monetary policy later this year, the dollar should resume its downtrend.\nIn the cryptocurrency market, speculators' net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures rose to 1,874 contracts 0#1CFTC1330E1 from 1,635 the previous week, the data showed.\nAfter a downtrend in the first few months of the year, bitcoin has stabilized between $8,000 and $9,000.

Right now, we don‚Äôt see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it‚Äôs something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we‚Äôll certainly support that.‚Äù PayPal‚Äôs Cryptocurrency Plans Despite Rainey‚Äôs comments, an increasing number of companies accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a payment method, primarily through third-party payment processors that convert the funds to local fiat currency at the point of sale to shelter merchants from price volatility.\nOverstock was the first major retailer to accept crypto, and it continues to do so today.\nExpedia enables users to pay for hotels and holidays with bitcoin, and some Subway locations also accept the largest cryptocurrency.\nMany smaller stores accept bitcoin, as well, and the number of outlets, both digital and real-world, accepting additional cryptocurrencies like litecoin and ethereum also continues to grow.\nSome PayPal founders and executives haven‚Äôt pulled their punches when talking about Bitcoin in the past.\nFounding CEO Bill Harris described Bitcoin as ‚Äúthe greatest scam in history‚Äù before claiming that it cost valuable natural resources, that almost nobody accepts it as a payment method, and that it has no intrinsic worth ‚Äî arguments that the Bitcoin community have had to field for many years now.\nDespite the bearish outlook of some executives, the online payment processor filed a patent in March this year for a system that would enable cryptocurrency users to swap private keys off-chain, rather than having to send coins over the network.\nThe company is clearly keeping a keen eye on the sector, as it develops.

Can someone please help me identify if this business is legit?", "text": "I posted this on /r/antiMLM and someone suggested I post here.\nTL;DR at the bottom. I'm so sorry this is so long, but I am just very worried about my aunt. She just recently lost her husband to cancer. Before he passed away, he invested money in some sort of Bitcoin mining company. The transaction was facilitated by a couple that I think he had seen present the business model at a \"millionaire's clubhouse\" \\(my aunt's words\\). The idea was that they buy hardware from their company which will mine Bitcoin little by little over three years. They say that it is more stable than buying Bitcoin, which can fluctuate in price and cause you to lose money. They give you an account you can log in to so that you can check your progress.\nYesterday, my aunt told my mom that she had earned money from mining and wanted to invest it in more mining hardware on my and my younger brother's behalf. She wanted my brother to come over to her house to meet the couple she had been working with so that they can explain the whole process to him. Because she is inept with technology, she was hoping that he could manage her account as well. My mom was concerned that this was a scam and begged me to accompany my brother just so there was another objective eye. I agreed and brought along my boyfriend.\nSo I'm going to try and do my best to describe what this couple was telling us. I don't know if it was just because I was tired, but it seemed like they were trying to explain this business as confusing as possible so that we couldn't ask them anymore questions.\nTo be able to use the mining hardware, you must buy into a \"mining pool\". There are three different kinds. I think it roughly goes from $500, $700, and $1000. The cheapest one will mine very small amounts. The more expensive the pool, the more Bitcoin is mined. If you want to be able to mine a larger amount of Bitcoin, you can buy all mining pools for one price of $3900. This is where the MLM alarms went off: the more people buy into your pool, the more Bitcoin you earn. So to really see the best profits, you would need to recruit people. This is essentially how this couple is making money. They showed us a preview of their mining pool and my boyfriend calculated that they were making around $1000 a day \\(although we're not sure if what they showed us was even real\\). So here is a list of all the sketchy things the three of us noted:\nMy aunt got into this whole investment while my uncle was sick with a stage 4 brain tumor. I'm worried they made these financial decisions while my uncle was not completely right of mind. The meeting was late at night, around 10pm. They were about 30 minutes late. The woman was the one creating the log in account for us. She said it doesn't even have to include our real names. Just a gmail that we can access. We cannot log in to check our mining process for 30 days. Apparently that's how long it takes for them to set up the mining hardware. The actual mining hardware is in Iceland. The United States is \"not friendly\" towards Bitcoin, according to the lady, so to be able to access your account you need to have a VPN on your computer. I asked them if we needed it on ours, and they said no. So I asked why my aunt needed it on hers. Apparently if you want to be able to recruit people like my aunt did, you need a different account \\(which surprise, you also have to pay for!\\). The mining will go on for 3 years. Depending on the kind of pool you buy and how many people are in that pool, a certain amount of Bitcoin will be earned. Obviously the more expensive the pool and the more people you recruit, the more Bitcoin it will mine. They say that after 3 years, you could potentially have 1 full Bitcoin or more. I asked them if my aunt was able to check on her account and the lady just responded \"Your aunt has a book of usernames and passwords.\" When my aunt wanted to check how much her account was worth, they lady just laughed and said \"You're worth enough\". She did not bother to show my aunt her account, even after her insisting. The man stayed completely silent until it was time to discuss all the \"benefits\" of Bitcoin and mining. He would not shut up about all the people he has recruited from all these different countries \\(including our home countries too\\). He also kept emphasizing how \"passive\" the money making process was, kept citing Forbe's magazine and the channel 11 news station regarding the huge value of Bitcoin, and bragged about being able to buy a Bentley and being close to buying his dream house. All he talked about was all the money he and his wife and other people were making from Bitcoin and my poor aunt was eating that shit up. My aunt wanted to just buy one account for my brother and I to share, but the lady kept insisting she buy us separate ones \\(including one for my boyfriend\\). Luckily my aunt was dead set on just getting one. They were asking my aunt if their meeting with her friend was set. She told them her friend was not available until 2 weeks from now and they said \"No, it has to be soon. We can't wait.\" I think my aunt is able to access her account. She says that she has already earned $1000 from the account that she set up in September. According to her, she has withdrawn money from there to help another aunt out with some expenses. At the end of the meeting, it turns out she couldn't even use the money she earned to buy us our own account because she has maxed out on her withdrawals \\(at least, that's the impression I got from the woman. Again, she was vague\\). She had to write a new check for $3900. The woman was very eager and even wrote the company name on the check for her. She also obnoxiously showed off another check that she had received from a client she had met that same day.\nWe told our mom what we saw the next day and she was mad we didn't try to stop her. I really do feel terrible that I let her spend her money like that, but from what we saw it seemed like she was very set on this mining thing and that we couldn't have talked her out of it at that moment even if we tried. We called her today to ask if she was able to cancel the check because we didn't think the couple was very legit. She sounded angry and told us: \"Well they already cashed the check. It's too late. I don't know what you've been reading but I know this works. I already earned $1000.\" My aunt has already tried to rope in some of my relatives on this scheme. A few were smart and saw right through the couple, and a few gave in just out of pity for my aunt. For her sake I'm hoping this will actually turn a profit, but I don't want her giving any more money to these people.\nI do have the URL to the mining website, but I didn't know if I am allowed to post it here. If necessary, I will PM the details to those who ask.\nTL:DR Is Bitcoin mining legit? My aunt has invested thousands in an MLM-type mining process that I don't completely understand or trust.\n submitted by /u/candyland4704\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T20:59:10.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab1b5356bd83736cbafb6635d40effb1cf1e08b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbKWhhW5.TXAnl07TuAOnGY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "payment using Bitcoin", "title_full": "payment using Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-19T01:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab1b5356bd83736cbafb6635d40effb1cf1e08b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbKWhhW5.TXAnl07TuAOnGY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "arya123210", "published": "2018-05-19T01:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "payment using Bitcoin", "text": "Yes I Think Payment With Bitcoin Easier Than Using a Keridt Card That's Hard enough For Me", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:48:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8d3a1e3b82e8bafbc3a7f6daf366c4eaa88ddc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWzh2tKDeAoS0EJsBHwA4Uc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Should bitcoin have risen a little slowly?", "title_full": "Should bitcoin have risen a little slowly?", "published": "2018-05-19T01:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.079, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8d3a1e3b82e8bafbc3a7f6daf366c4eaa88ddc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWzh2tKDeAoS0EJsBHwA4Uc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cintya31", "published": "2018-05-19T01:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should bitcoin have risen a little slowly?", "text": "Well, Bitcoin's volatility is and has always been the problem here, its just crazy, from $7k to $19K and now down to $6K, whooh really a big leap, and then a big drop.

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it‚Äôs not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking .\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can‚Äôt be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the ‚ÄúGold is owned by the Bankers‚Äù so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement . While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it‚Äôs a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council ‚Äì Total above-ground stocks 2017 ) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn‚Äôt more than 10,000-15,000 mt.\nSecondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:\nOf the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.\nFor there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.\nSo, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.\nRegardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public‚Äôs money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.\nNow, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.\nIf we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:\nBitcoin‚Äôs 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.\nSecondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology . I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant‚Äôs life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble. 729 views", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://investmentwatchblog.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=b23beecbe6af6dce5dfd43483&id=6af0db0d33", "https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/gold-mining/how-much-gold-has-been-mined", "https://srsroccoreport.com/why-gold-is-the-king-monetary-asset-not-bitcoin/", "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DAKZTAE6PJLGW"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T01:28:53.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4eb5ac7ed6e19227c5721f4c00d66724a29c3b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNLiNxUaZKpdmu6t4qYvtg743nQIr1BgUSrtY0Gb_1IJUGgndcRHFePw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Future - A Simple Explanation", "title_full": "Bitcoin Future - A Simple Explanation", "published": "2018-05-19T01:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4eb5ac7ed6e19227c5721f4c00d66724a29c3b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNLiNxUaZKpdmu6t4qYvtg743nQIr1BgUSrtY0Gb_1IJUGgndcRHFePw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-19T01:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Future - A Simple Explanation", "text": "Bitcoin Future - A Simple Explanation\n/u/jony3k\nsubmitted by /u/jony3k\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T01:02:12.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97c853c091eec939941843440d5d3d0e8c4bc59c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTIO6tBMaZ3tmxVHx1ik6D4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=191.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)", "title": "Harga Bitcoin Pernah Dimanipulasi Loh..", "title_full": "Harga Bitcoin Pernah Dimanipulasi Loh..", "published": "2018-05-19T01:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97c853c091eec939941843440d5d3d0e8c4bc59c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTIO6tBMaZ3tmxVHx1ik6D4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "acord00", "published": "2018-05-19T01:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Harga Bitcoin Pernah Dimanipulasi Loh..", "text": "Mungkin topik ini sudah ada yang pernah bahas sebelumnya, tapi saya ingin membahasnya kembali agar para newbie bisa tau tentang fakta penting ini.\nTak seperti transaksi saham atau komoditas, nilai Bitcoin tidak dapat diprediksi. Nilainya bisa naik sekaligus turun dalam satu hari perdagangan saja\nNamun, ada indikasi telah terjadi manipulasi nilai Bitcoin. Manipulasi ini terjadi pada tahun 2013 lalu.\nKetika itu, harga Bitcoin bisa naik dari US$150/koin menjadi US$1.000/koin. Kenaikan ini terjadi hanya dalam rentan waktu dua bulan saja.\nAda empat orang peneliti yang menemukan manipulasi tersebut. Menurut mereka lonjakan nilai Bitcoin dilakukan oleh satu orang.\nDalam makalahnya berjudul ¬ìPrice Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem¬î yang dipublikasikan dalam jurnal Ekonomi Moneter, Neil Gandal, JT Hamrick, Tyler Moore dan Tali Oberman menggambarkan aktivitas mencurigakan di pusat pertukaran mata uang digital (cryptocurrency), Mt. Gox, yang berdampak pada nilai Bitcoin Cs pada 2013.\nSeperti dilansir TechCrunch dan dikutip CNBC, para peneliti ini menemukan manipulasi harga ini dikerjakan dua bot dan terdaftar sebagai ¬ì??¬î pada negara pengguna. Mereka menamai bot ini ¬ìMarkus¬î dan ¬ìWilly¬î.\nMarkus membeli dan menjual bitcoin dengan harga yang tampaknya acak dan tidak membayar biaya transaksi. Setelah diperiksa lebih lanjut, Markus sebenarnya tidak membayar Bitcoin yang diterima. Markus memperoleh 335.889 bitcoin dan aktif mulai 14 Februari 2013 sampai 27 September 2013.\nTujuh jam setelah Markus menjadi tidak aktif, Willy muncul dengan 49 akun. Masing-masing akun Willy ini secara berurutan membeli bitcoin senilai US$ 2,5 juta dan kemudian menjadi tidak aktif. Selama periode ini, harga bitcoin melonjak.\nSumber : CNBC Indonesia", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:50:01.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36fb692bbd1295227d7831188f2942bb2a9c20c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq.rA7v2LAkhjwlE5jhhosRq3IyrlgFe_hy7sfgM_K_BuR9xlgwsQFKVi0TW.42A7Yqyo9a2_NpmEamkKSz3DjvSN8h90qkCCbBapcV4KPXNiikyQLJdNh09q1ngBKyVCTlwKUZzjyQYBfz15z327sOm6pZPag7GCyw--", "site_full": "www.thestreet.com", "site": "thestreet.com", "site_section": "http://www.thestreet.com:80/feeds/rss/search.html?topicSearch=Banks", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "TheStreet Search RSS Feed: Banks", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Sink to One-Month Low as Bid to $10,000 Falters", "title_full": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Sink to One-Month Low as Bid to $10,000 Falters - TheStreet", "published": "2018-05-19T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1d176766-31d8-11e8-b78e-2db6e0c31c66.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2567, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36fb692bbd1295227d7831188f2942bb2a9c20c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq.rA7v2LAkhjwlE5jhhosRq3IyrlgFe_hy7sfgM_K_BuR9xlgwsQFKVi0TW.42A7Yqyo9a2_NpmEamkKSz3DjvSN8h90qkCCbBapcV4KPXNiikyQLJdNh09q1ngBKyVCTlwKUZzjyQYBfz15z327sOm6pZPag7GCyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Home", "published": "2018-05-19T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Sink to One-Month Low as Bid to $10,000 Falters", "text": "Bitcoin prices continued a significant decline in Friday trading. Here's what you need to know.\nPrices Struggle to Hold $8,000 Bitcoin prices dipped as low as $7,930 in Friday trading as the early-May bid toward $10,000 looked to disappear. The top cryptocurrency by market value led most of the largest digital assets into the red, as only about 12 of the top 100 cryptos traded higher in afternoon action. Bitcoin hadn't dipped below $8,000 since mid-April before Friday. Despite early-May momentum, bitcoin failed to reach the psychologically important $10,000 threshold in its most recent traverse higher - prices last topped $10,000 on March 8.\nFed's Brainard: No Need for FedCoin Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said on Friday that there is no \"compelling\" need for a central bank-backed cryptocurrency, according to Coindesk . Brainard said, although a central bank cryptocurrency could address some of the digital asset space's biggest problems, it \"may not withstand closer scrutiny.\" Brainard later reiterated an earlier espoused position, noting that cryptocurrencies don't pose any meaningful threat to financial stability in the U.S. She added that the Fed is closely monitoring developments in cryptocurrency payments policy, supervision, regulation and stability.\nSwitzerland Considers State-Backed Crypto While the U.S. central bank looks to eschew the notion of a Fed-backed cryptocurrency, Switzerland has embraced the possibility. Switzerland is formally considering the option of issuing a state-backed cryptocurrency to be called the \"e-franc,\" Bitcoin.com reported . The country's government has commissioned legislators to conduct a study on how such a cryptocurrency might work. \"The Federal Council is aware of the major challenges, both legal and monetary, which would be accompanied by the use of an e-franc. It asks that the proposal be adopted to examine the risks and opportunities of an e-franc and to clarify the legal, economic and financial aspects of the e-franc,\" lawmakers submitted this week.\nChinese Tea Tokenizers Arrested on Fraud Charges Police in Shenzhen, China, reportedly arrested six individuals who allegedly defrauded 3,000 Chinese investors out of $47 million by selling them a cryptocurrency they said was backed by a commodity, local media reported . The suspects formed the crypto firm PEB, which started issuing coins in January 2017 that they claimed were backed by ownership of a certain amount of Pu'er Tibetan tea the firm owned. PEB told investors it had billions of dollars' worth of the tea in its stock. According to local police, PEB had a \"very limited amount of the tea in stock,\" and had promised unwitting investors high short-term returns through social media posts and roadshows. Police said the six in question manipulated markets to drive the price of PEB's tokens higher twenty-fold last year.\nTheStreet presents on May 22: \"How to Stomach Market Volatility.\" Hosted by Fisher Investments, the exclusive live webinar will give you the tools to successfully navigate market volatility and discuss why having a wealth manager is more critical than ever before.

(Shutterstock) CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference is over and it failed to pump up cryptocurrenc ies.\nSince Rule #2 of my 3 Rules of Bitcoin is there are no rules when it comes to hyping crypto, this was an ideal opportunity for the crypto community to hype demand and drive prices higher. Tom Lee, or @fundstrat on twitter, was one of those regularly calling for ever higher prices, who predicted #Consensus2018 to deliver higher prices. Of course, according on CNBC , he doubled down after the conference (I guess if you first don't succeed, try and try again?).\nThe reality of the conference, according to Bloomberg was that Crypto Wealth declined $45 billion during the week. Bitcoin dropped. Ripple dropped. Ethereum dropped. Litecoin dropped. No crypto was spared.\nThe inability of the conference participants (and their twitter accounts) to deliver price gains should be a concern for crypto holders. It is almost as though they were 'preaching to the choir' and it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new adopters , which is ultimately what these digital currencies need to continue to rise (bitcoin is still less than 50% of its high, which occurred almost 6 months ago).\nMy perception of the rate of new adopters drives much of my analysis on where I see crypto prices heading over the coming months - and my perception is the rate of new money coming into crypto is very low. Yes, the miners and large holders will continue to try and spoof this unregulated market higher, since they have every incentive to do so and there is no protection for those who get sucked into any false price action they create. But that is not the rate of adoption crypto needs to thrive.\nContrast #Consensus2018 to the period that started around Thanksgiving in the U.S. At that time there was excitement about bitcoin futures coming to the CME and CBOE and there was still hope that Bitcoin ETFs would become a reality. There was a real thirst for information on crypto and many of the exchanges were offering easier and more streamlined paths to ownership. That helped drive a price surge that I believed in as Bitcoin had victory after victory ahead of the futures launch . I say that to point out that I am not some permabear on crypto or one of those who insists it has no value, just that right now I don't think it can maintain current prices.\nThe hype surrounding crypto is fading for now, and that will drive prices lower as the insular group that is currently involved has minimal capacity to drive prices higher and the pace of new adopters is very slow at the moment.\nWhile Bill Gates might not be able to short bitcoin as he lamented on CNBC - you could take a shot - on small size, in the futures market.\nDisclaimer: Any opinions expressed are those of Peter Tchir.

This time analysis depends largely on what‚Äôs known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim.\nFundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions Fundstrat‚Äôs head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, ‚ÄúThe release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.‚Äù\nCapex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated.\nInternal Fundstrat research document ‚ÄúWe believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,‚Äù Mr. Doctor continued. ‚ÄúThe primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.‚Äù\nIf a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent.\nA Rosy Immediate Future Most of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures.\nMr. Doctor further elaborated how ‚Äúminers verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner‚Äôs Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.‚Äù And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain‚Äôs Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model.\nSuch rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone.\nStill other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given.

Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 percent this week to $8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes ‚Äî the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis ‚Äî predicted a surge to $50,000 by year-end.\n‚ÄúWhile there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference,‚Äù Lee wrote in a note Friday.

For legislative candidates, that‚Äôs $400 per individual or business per election cycle; for statewide offices, such as governor, secretary of state, attorney general and treasurer , that‚Äôs $1,150.\nThe draft rule also says the amount of the contribution is the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the contribution.

Turns out I was right, but way overestimated the impact. My three-man office does about 900 returns by April 15, and it so happened that one, and only one, person had investment income from bitcoin.\nHow does the IRS handle it? Just like any other type of investment income. For now.\nBelow is a pretty good introduction to Bitcoin. I‚Äôve listened to it over the past three days during my morning walks. They say the best indicator of how well you know a subject is if you can teach it. Well, I certainly can‚Äôt teach you bitcoin; maybe, just maybe, I can pass a multiple-choice exam on it. But it is fascinating, and the 25-minute video will fill you in on the gist of the cryptocurrency:\nI have two big questions, though. First, when they say that bitcoin is trading at 1 Bitcoin = $8,126.44 (as it is now as I‚Äôm writing this), is that ‚Äútrade‚Äù something that happens within the bitcoin realm or on some market exchange outside it? Within the blockchain, or between a bunch of Wall Street firms trading pieces of paper. And if the ‚Äútrade‚Äù transaction is within the blockchain, how is the value to the dollar determined?\nSecond, as per the video, when you have two blockchains to evaluate, the rule of thumb is to always treat the longer chain, the one that‚Äôs had the most work done to it, as the valid one. So what then happens in this situation:\nChain 1 has 10,000 transactions and ends with A, B, C, D, and E.\nChain 2 has those same 10,000 transactions but ends with X, Y, and Z.\nYou‚Äôd treat Chain 1 as the valid blockchain.

I was thinking if I can make my btc earnings a start for a business, what do you think?\nI think yes, Bitcoin investment can absolutely have a steady monthly amount. When I joined the Bounty program on this forum, I actually quit my job at a company.\nYou were wrong when advising him. Investing in Bitcoin has a lot of risks and losses are possible. In investment cannot be sure about the profits, so there is no fixed daily income, monthly for Bitcoin.\nI think still people have the opportunity to make money from bitcoin investment. Because still bitcoin price is too much low as compare to the adoptor of bitcoin users, in fact still majority of people do not know anything about bitcoin but now bitcoin is being introduced in so many places therefore bitcoin users are also increasing from time to time. therefore the price of bitcoin is also expected to increase too much in near future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

The cryptocurrency has dropped more than 40 percent this year.\n\"While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on crypto-currencies strengthened during the conference,\" said Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, who is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin.\nThis year's Consensus conference drew in more than 8,500 attendees, according to Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of parent company Digital Currency Group.\nThat's more than triple the 2,700 attendees CoinDesk reported for the May 2017 conference. At roughly $2,000 a ticket, the conference raked in at least $17 million in ticket sales alone.\nMore than 20 other events happened as part of a \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation.\nAmong the private, post-conference festivities: Snoop Dogg performed in the West Village for crypto start-up Ripple, and a new venture called rented out the 210-foot party yacht \"Cornucopia Majesty.\"\nZ-cash is one of the the only major cryptocurrencies to rally this week after trading platform Gemini announced it would list the coin on its licensed exchange.\nOther major cryptocurrencies struggled this week.

It doesn't matter how simple the firmware is, it's proprietary, and that means users cannot verify your claims without spending the BTC from these notes.\nTangem notes don't need \"independent certification\" or \"manufacturer attestation\" if there's no need to trust anyone. That literally means customers are being invited to trust your attestations and certifications.\nA significant part of what makes Bitcoin valuable is that anyone can verify the validity of a payment, not just a company paid by a manufacturer to do so. The previous physical Bitcoin producers (or at least Casascius anyway) were very upfront that trust was essential to their product, that made it easier to trust them. The fact that you at Tangem either don't understand that, or are wilfully misrepresenting the fact, makes it much much more difficult to trust you or your notes.\nYou're drawing your perceived contradictions from using the word ¬´trust¬ª with materially different connotations for a rhetorical effect. Compare:\n1. I informedly trust this airplane not to crash, because: authorities are certifying it, Boeing is a serious business, engineers are not murderers, there are many failsafes, planes rarely crash.\n2. I blindly trust this stranger to hit an apple on my head with a gun from 30 feet, because: they say they can, how hard can it be, why would anyone want to shoot me, it's so cool.\nTangem was carefully designed and built into #1, Casascius, in any engineer's eyes, is #2.\nOur goal is to structure the product in a way where we can't do anything harmful, out of malice or stupidity, even if we really wanted to ¬ó including the edge cases of a sudden dissolution of the company or even hostile takeover. Every product will still function forever, and be secure for its lifetime.\nTo this end, we already closed the trust loop ¬ó by keeping the product simple (relatively tiny attack surface) and bridging multinational certifications with independent audit of unquestionable integrity on top of a simple open protocol and reference implementations.\nIn the consumer space, there's no hardware product that even claims this level of security, much less achieves it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:35:22.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0abfb28a3cc8a8d6096972d1bd19cedf016702d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQAfVQwd474xvQaGOuVMb_s-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Panic selling can contribute to bitcoin price going down?", "title_full": "Panic selling can contribute to bitcoin price going down?", "published": "2018-05-19T00:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0abfb28a3cc8a8d6096972d1bd19cedf016702d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQAfVQwd474xvQaGOuVMb_s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "paulk11087", "published": "2018-05-19T00:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Panic selling can contribute to bitcoin price going down?", "text": "Quote: from: Btcwashu on April 04, 2018, 12:15:10 PM I need some opinion if panic selling can contribute of rapidly drop of the bitcoin price.

Whoever installs the updates will be able to benefit from the new features.\nIn cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, however, things are not that simple. Instead of running on the servers of a single company, the Bitcoin software runs on thousands of computers called miners. These computers are scattered across the world and get compensated in bitcoins for verifying transactions and maintaining the network. Related: The Five Most Important Blockchain Trends In 2018\nWhen a group of developers creates an upgrade to the Bitcoin software, all (or a vast majority of) those computers must install the new software. This is called \"consensus.\"\nBut miners might not agree to update their software. Why? Because a change to the protocol might affect the rules of mining competition, favoring some types of mining hardware while negatively affecting others. In that case, those who stand to lose will probably refrain from installing the software, unless there‚Äôs already a strong consensus behind the update.\nIf a specific update doesn‚Äôt win consensus and a considerable number of miners don‚Äôt agree to install the new version of the Bitcoin protocol, the software \"forks.\" This means there will exist two concurrent versions of the software and, depending on how fundamental the differences between the two versions of the Bitcoin software are, the result might be a ‚Äúsoft fork‚Äù or a ‚Äúhard fork.‚Äù\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between a \"soft\" and a ‚Äúhard‚Äù fork?\nIf a new version of the Bitcoin protocol is backward-compatible, then the fork that results from the lack of consensus is a \"soft fork.\" This means that miners running both versions of the software will be able to continue mining bitcoins on the same blockchain.\nBlockchain is the distributed ledger where Bitcoin transactions are registered. Every few minutes, a number of new transactions that miners have confirmed are compiled into a block and registered on the blockchain, which is then replicated across all the computers in the Bitcoin network (read here and here for more on the process).\nAn example of a soft fork is the original SegWit , which came into effect last August. In a nutshell, SegWit changed the way transactions were packed into each block, but it did it in a way that allowed nodes running the old software to continue processing them.\nAlternatively, if the new version of the software is not compatible with the previous one, the resulting fork will be a \"hard fork.\"\nThe developers of a hard fork update usually specify a block number at which it will become activated, at which point a new blockchain and a new cryptocurrency are created. From that point on, the miners running the different version of the software will be registering transactions on their separate blockchains.\nAn example of a hard fork is the Bitcoin Cash fork , which took effect last August and created the new BCH cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash changed the blockchain block size from 1 MB to 8 MB to accommodate for more transactions per block, which means its blocks could no longer be registered on the original Bitcoin blockchain and needed their own separate version of the ledger.\nWhat you need to know about the extra hard fork money\nAs mentioned in the previous section, a hard fork creates a new cryptocurrency. What this means is that, for instance, when the Bitcoin Cash hard fork occurred, whoever held bitcoins received an equal amount of BCH on the new blockchain.\nHard forks will, as many like to publicize, double your cryptocurrencies and give you free money, which is true. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs usually a hype and rush to buy b itcoins before a hard fork occurs, which sends bitcoin prices soaring. Related: The ‚ÄòWolf of Wall Street‚Äô Is A Multi-Million-Dollar Deadbeat\nBut things are not that simple. When a hard fork splits the Bitcoin blockchain, it reduces its mining power. It will also split the community, which means demand for each individual coin will become lower. If the mining power diminishes too much, transactions will take longer to confirm, which can in-turn dissuade users from using that specific coin.\nAll these parameters can negatively impact the prices of a coin, and if transactions become too slow, the cryptocurrency might die altogether.\nIn fact, part of the reason that the Segwit2x hard fork (mentioned at the beginning of this article) was called off was that a lack of consensus threatened to create two very weak currencies that would endanger the very existence of all Bitcoin versions .\nBottom line: While after a hard fork your bitcoins might double in number, there‚Äôs a chance their collective value won‚Äôt be worth a lot more, and might even be worth less. And as the Bitcoin community grows, and individuals and organizations with differing (and often conflicting) goals enter the fray, many more forks will probably lie ahead.\nBy Ben Dickson via the Amity Blog\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/explainer-what-is-segwit2x-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/", "https://amity.io/blog/how-to-solve-bitcoin-mining-insane-power-consumption-problem", "http://fortune.com/2017/08/11/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-price-date-why/", "http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/bitcoin-price-segwit2x/", "https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/09/13/fork-segwit-everything-need-know-bitcoin-scaling/", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/04/19/bitcoin-cash-approaches-1000-ahead-of-hard-fork/#7b6425102aeb", "https://amity.io/blog/", "https://amity.io/blog/when-there-are-no-bitcoins-left-to-mine-what-happens", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/10/23/will-this-battle-for-the-soul-of-bitcoin-destroy-it/#590c64be3d3c"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:10:53.047+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 10209, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=22000", "requestsLeft": 442}
