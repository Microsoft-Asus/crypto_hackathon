As I explained via a Sopranos reference , asking if there’s manipulation going on in cryptocurrencies is like asking if there’s prostitution going on at the Bada Bing! . That is, of course there’s manipulation in that market. But the larger issue is that the whole damn thing is suspect. Going after Bitcoin spoofers is like arresting hookers at the Bing . You’re missing the forest for the trees.\nI joke a lot about the absurdity inherent in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and proponents of the market don’t do themselves any favors by doing shit that reinforces stereotypes (see here and here , for instance). But in all seriousness, there is virtually no chance these “assets” survive in their current form. That doesn’t mean the concept of cryptocurrencies and/or the theoretical underpinnings of the market are going away, but it does mean that if you’re betting on, say, Bitcoin in its current form to rally unimpeded to infinity on the way to supplanting traditional currencies printed by developed market central banks, you are a moron. Plain and simple. It ain’t gonna happen.\nOne person who agrees is Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller (and really I don’t even know why I bother because citing mainstream economists in an effort to convince cryptocurrency acolytes they’re wrong is an exercise in futility by definition), who earlier this week chatted with CNBC about what the future is likely to look like for Bitcoin.\nHis overarching message was that it might well just go the way of the dinosaurs, but he couched it in friendlier terms than that. To wit:\nBitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.\nYes, “a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.” Of course that assumes it still exists in one form or another and while, as alluded to above, it’s likely the concept isn’t going away, it’s possible that it will, in which case there will be no “dispute” and the only people claiming it’s still around will be the people who swear to Christ that Megalodon is still swimming around out there somewhere.\nIn any event, the punchline to the whole Shiller video comes when he describes an exchange he had with a student who insisted on keeping his laptop open during finals so he could ensure he didn’t miss an “opportunity” to trade fucking Bitcoin. Have a listen:\nGot that? Just in case, here’s the transcript:\nShiller: I had one student who asked if he could keep his laptop during our final exam because he wanted to make sure he could make a trade… on Bitcoin. I told him, ok if it’s so important to you, you can trade during the final exam.\nAnd see that right there neatly encapsulates this whole debate.\n50 years from now we’ll either be living in “a crypto future” involving Tron -esque cityscapes, massage parlors where topless Sophias give happy endings for Ripple tips and giant talking billboards featuring stream-of-consciousness-style ramblings from Supreme Leader John McAfee (who will have survived to be 125 years old thanks to robotics), or we’ll still be living in some iteration of the current system.\nIf the former turns out to be the case, well then I guess Shiller’s Bitcoin trading student will have the last laugh. But if the latter plays out, well then that student will be the moron who botched a Shiller final exam because he was busy staring at his Coinbase account.\n[Disclaimer: I have no idea if that student in fact botched the exam, but if he’s trading Bitcoin, well…] Shares 0 Popular Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/i/moments/946899595128291332?lang=en", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bada_Bing"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "robert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heisenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T17:35:41.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bc6a260b08c42475d8b1b3da94a23cd495d900f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggnvre81nx_LclYmZmNsbW8VLegtmm0rT6QRvxAGFpqYm2rNb3sdWYnLZpOslOhiQtU-", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/topic/economy", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Going Up?

The decentralized nature of this cryptocurrency makes it ideal for storing value and transferring funds. Bitcoin has undergone significant upgrades since it was first introduced to the world via Satoshi’s whitepaper nine years prior and today, Bitcoin software development is ushering a new era of tokenization into the global economy. Tokenization\nTokenization is the process of assigning real-world assets to a digital token that lives on the blockchain. There are some serious advantages that can be obtained through this process, and this is why numerous development teams have spent millions of dollars thinking of unique ways to make the tokenization process more streamlined. Storing the ownership rights to a particular item on the blockchain is a huge upgrade over the current complex paper systems in operation.\nTokenization provides the global economic structure with more efficient means of registering, transferring, and proving ownership over certain assets. Tokenizing a particular item allows the owner to transfer the property as easily as it is to transfer BTC. Tokenized Real Estate Would Provide for a More Efficient Market\nThere are numerous reasons why a property owner would seek to employ blockchain technology to protect their investments. The immutable and unalterable nature of blockchain technology makes it perfectly suited to handle ownership-related tasks and by upgrading to a tokenized system, a higher level of security and efficiency can be achieved in the market. Bitcoin Software Development – Colored Coins\nBitcoin’s scripting language has always allowed users to store small bits of metadata on the blockchain, and savvy developers have spent years creating different means into which this data could be used to represent ownership of a particular asset. The term “colored coins” is used by many to describe BTCs that have ownership rights attached to them. Colored coins are seen by many in the crypto community as the next step in the evolution of the BTC saga that has already seen this crypto go from a digital currency to a store-of-value, and now, real asset ownership rights. Intangible Assets\nThe term “real world assets” can be loosely used to describe any item that holds value outside the digital realm. Among these items are intangible assets, or items that have no physical form in the real world. This can include items such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Intangible items are much easier to tokenize than items that have a physical representation but there are still some limiting factors that must be addressed before full-scale tokenization can occur in this business sector.\nItems such as copyrights can have very different legal transfer structures that must be followed. These can vary across state and country borders. This would mean that any tokenization of these assets would have to be able to fall in line with the country of origin in which the item is being transferred from to ensure that the transfer of the ownership token is legally binding on an international level. Fungible Assets\nFungible assets are items that are interchangeable with each other. Items such as gold can be interchanged as long as the amount and quality of the property that’s in possession remains the same. Fungible items are much easier to tokenize because there’s no need to create another layer of individual representation for the asset. A token that represents 1-ounce of gold is the perfect example of a fungible asset.\nWhoever is in possession of the ownership token is entitled to 1-ounce of gold at a certain purity level. There’s no need for the token to be pegged to an exact piece of gold as would be the case in a token that represented, say, ownership in a particular piece of art. Physical Assets\nTokenizing items such as real estate is considered by many in the industry as the next logical step in the evolution of BTC’s blockchain. The real estate market benefits greatly from the introduction of tokenization to the sector. The property ownership systems currently in place are grossly inefficient and in many instances, this can lead to disputes over the true ownership of a particular piece of real estate or parcel of land. Blockchain Technology Provides More Security to the Market\nThrough tokenization, the owner of a property could be ensured that their ownership rights are not infringed upon. The current paper-based system is filled with flaws in which property owners in many countries lack the ability to prove if there have been multiple paper rights provided to a particular property. Duplicate land titles have been a real issue in developing countries where record keeping systems are still lagging behind.\nBlockchain-based systems would eliminate these concerns from the market on a global scale and because of the cost-effective manner in which they can be implemented; any country can take advantage of the added protection afforded through the use of blockchain protocols. Shared Assets\nThe ability to co-own assets in the digital economy is perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of this financial revolution. Blockchain technology allows for multiple parties to own a particular asset at a fractional level. For example, the platform Nametoken allows users to crowdfund premium domain investments. These assets are tokenized and the investment protocols programmed directly into the blockchain contract.\nThrough the use of an integrated voting mechanism, Nametoken users can vote on when to sell the domain. Upon the sale, all of the profits are automatically divided and sent to the investors involved via preprogrammed blockchain protocols. Similar systems are currently being employed on everything from real estate to song ownership rights. Bitcoin Software Development – Legal Issues\nPerhaps the biggest concern to developers of tokenization platforms isn’t the protocol at all, but rather, the constantly shifting legal ecosystems of various jurisdictions. Until a more global approach to these concerns can be achieved, it may still be years before true tokenization becomes a mainstream practice. There’s no doubt that there is a serious need for this technology in the market and as with most revolutionary technological advancements, there is always a delay before the legal system can catch up to the technology. A Tokenized Future is Ahead of Us\nYou can expect to see more tokenization-based platforms enter the market in the coming months. The advantages of this revolutionary technology are undeniable and this year is already seeing governmental institutions researching how to implement such protocols into their current systems. Hopefully, there can be some common consensus met that allows tokenized assets to be legally binding in the future as there are some clear advantages for all parties involved.\nWhat do you guys think?

We respect your privacy, Bitcoin and the Power Grid FREEMANSPERSPECTIVE · May 31st, 2018\n“Bitcoin is evil” articles exist in profusion, and these days I pretty much ignore them. But one of the recent types – raising awareness of Bitcoin’s environmental unsustainability – has engaged me. As it turns out, I have an unusual background to bring to this topic, and I think I should contribute.\nSo, here we go: Another Apocalypse?\nLet’s be honest and admit that most of the “environmental movement” sells fear of an apocalypse. And as we should all realize by now, humans have an innate weakness for fear.\nMore or less every apocalyptic environmental prediction has failed. (I’m talking about those that could actually be measured, obviously.) That won’t stop the fear-sellers of course, and now Bitcoin has come into their sights.\nThe fear is that because crypto mining uses so much power, it will bring down the grid or cause various environmental disasters. The advocates of this fear throw around scary sounding numbers (measured in terawatts) and assorted scientific terminology. (“They understand it and you don’t… don’t expose yourself to ridicule.”)\nBut it’s mostly just fear. Sure, proof-of-work sucks up power, but that’s nothing new. How much power do you suppose all those millions of air conditioners suck up every summer? I haven’t dug up the figures, but I’m ready to take bets that it’s several times more than crypto mining. Shall we now fear the air conditioner? Further Factors\nI worked for decades in the electrical industry, and so I’d like to give you some facts from that perspective:\nPower use has been going up since the beginning. These days most houses get 200 amperes of electrical service. But there are still thousands of houses that are wired with only 60 amperes. That was plenty 60 years ago. New loads (devices using power) come along all the time. In just my time, we’ve added air conditioning, microwaves, and lots of computers.\nMining is a nice, steady load. The kind power companies thrive on. What makes their lives crazy are seasonal loads like air conditioning, which occur only a few months per year.\nPower failures happen every year, especially in summer due to the aforementioned air conditioning load. It’s a good bet that several fear-sellers have press releases ready to go for this summer.\nThe utilities are making money on this. More power use means more income.\nIf people use too much power, the providers will raise their prices. Econ 101. And the Big One\nCryptocurrencies don’t finance war.\nThe public hasn’t actually paid for a war since WW2. Since then the whole game’s been run on credit. (The same goes, more or less, for everything Big Guv does to save us poor, helpless sheep.)\nWith Bitcoin and all the cryptos that I know of, you can’t do such things. If you want to throw a war in a crypto-based economy, you’ll have to convince people to pay for it. Good luck. * * * * *\nA book that generates comments like these, from actual readers, might be worth your time: I just finished reading The Breaking Dawn and found it to be one of the most thought-provoking, amazing books I have ever read… It will be hard to read another book now that I’ve read this book… I want everyone to read it.

The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s... accepted by a group of people.... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters .\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated as being 2.5% of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month of Ramazan, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month.\nExperts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nSimilar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, the hospital says .\nCastle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately.\nThe help is not cheap: according to WikiTribune , Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says itoffers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://castlecraig.co.uk/resources/gambling/cryptocurrency-addiction/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/paxfuls-formerly-homeless-founder-wants-to-give-back-with-bitcoin/", "https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/05/29/cryptocurrencies/crypto-rehab-center-launches-in-scotland/72076/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ed oswald con", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T02:41:52.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94ae7c2ec7f09a1c47b24810657da20232587fca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pii7YSwnrbk0seic59ISNq213qRiRdWQbFSuRriLe_4vl9HE6XYZc_7Pi3Jhnbdjs6iIP9qvQemg-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin company Blockchain hits 25 million crypto wallets", "title_full": "Bitcoin company Blockchain hits 25 million crypto wallets", "published": "2018-05-31T17:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94ae7c2ec7f09a1c47b24810657da20232587fca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pii7YSwnrbk0seic59ISNq213qRiRdWQbFSuRriLe_4vl9HE6XYZc_7Pi3Jhnbdjs6iIP9qvQemg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-31T17:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin company Blockchain hits 25 million crypto wallets", "text": "Bitcoin company Blockchain hits 25 million crypto wallets by 0\nLIVE from the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center in San Francisco on Thursday, June 14. distributed ledger technology on which bitcoin was built, in 2008, is called “blockchain.”” data-reactid=”15″>It can be confusing for cryptocurrency newbies to learn that one of the oldest bitcoin companies, launched in 2011, is named Blockchain, and the distributed ledger technology on which bitcoin was built, in 2008, is called “blockchain.” cold storage” by using a hardware wallet.)” data-reactid=”16″>Nevertheless, Blockchain, the company, which is the world’s No.\n1 provider of free wallet software for storing cryptocurrency, hit a significant milestone this week: 25 million customer wallets.

Bittrex Launches USD Trading Pairs May 31, 2018 8 Views Wilma Woo · May 31, 2018 · 1:00 pm\nSeattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex has confirmed that it has reached an agreement allowing customers to buy Bitcoin with US dollars. ‘It’s Been A Long Path’\nEarlier today, Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara announced that the exchange had reached an agreement with New York-based Signature Bank, which – along with other financial institutions – will hold customers’ USD funds. Initially available only to corporate clients in Washington, California, New York, and Montana, the first USD trading pairs will be Bitcoin, Tether, and TrueUSD.\nShihara told Bloomberg :\nIt’s been a long path. […] It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance. The best alternative to having your own banking license. So far only for corporate accounts… Bittrex gets bank agreement to help you buy Bitcoin with dollars https://t.co/rgoNhH2a2D via @markets\n— Christian Kühl (@chrkuhl) May 31, 2018 Big Banks Lose Out\nThe move is equally conspicuous on the part of Signature. That the bank is based in New York, a jurisdiction infamous for its BitLicense scheme, is not without a touch of irony. The broad-reaching and overly invasive initiative has caused a number of cryptocurrency businesses to leave the state, while others have stopped serving New York residents altogether.\nWith several major US lenders – including Wells Fargo, which previously provided banking support for Bittrex – banning customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies with their bank-issued credit cards, smaller banks like Signature are stepping in to fill the void.\nSpeaking about the agreement, Shihara commented:\nThey really do look and pore through the entire business. […] They want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances.\nWhile Bittrex can now resume US dollar trading, other exchanges are struggling to gain banking support. The one exception seems to be Coinbase. The largest of the US exchanges, Coinbase continues to expand its suite of willing banking partners.

That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month.\nExperts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nSimilar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, the hospital says .\nCastle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately.\nThe help is not cheap: according to WikiTribune , Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says it offers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.

Digital payments in Russia have become fraught in recent years, with U.S. payment giants Visa and MasterCard blocking credit card services to some Russian bank customers as a result of U.S. sanctions back in 2014.\nWhile the pair have since developed a way around the sanctions (and today process some 90% of all transactions in the country), there is still plenty of friction when it comes to digital payments. Last year Visa and MasterCard were blocked from Fintech, the Russian center for new financial technology as the Kremlin works on its own domestic payment system, Mir.\nNow some have turned to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to pay their way to the Russia World Cup (interestingly, you were able to bet on the 2014 Brazil World Cup using Bitcoin ).\nIt was revealed in May some hotels in the Russia city of Kaliningrad — which will be playing host to some of the tournament's games — were accepting Bitcoin as payment while some airlines and travel agents, as well as bars, will be taking the cryptocurrency .\nThe use of Bitcoin as a means of exchange is something the cryptocurrency has been struggling with since fees for sending Bitcoin spiked in December.\nAt its peak at the end of 2017 there were roughly 400,000 Bitcoin transactions per day though this has now fallen back to around 200,000 transactions per day , and fees are back down with it.\nThorsten Koeppl, professor of economics at Queen's University in Canada, previously said : \"The value of Bitcoin is partly driven by its potential as a payments tool and, before the fees rose along with the price, there were people using Bitcoin for international transfers. This has become more expensive to do now. But the price is still being supported.\"\nAs Bitcoin is increasingly used as a means of exchange, its utility will rise and demand along with it, pushing up the Bitcoin price — along with other cryptocurrencies being used for transactions.\nThe Bitcoin price has struggled in 2018 after reach giddy heights of almost $19,000 late last year. Bitcoin, along with many other major cryptocurrencies, has slumped in recent weeks — and investors are worried this downward trend will continue.\nCoinDesk The Bitcoin price has been on a downward trend over recent months.\nMany thought New York's Blockchain Week in May — which included the mammoth Consensus conference — would spark a bull run, but that failed to materialize and some are now looking towards the next Bitcoin so-called halving event, in just under two year's time , as the next boom-time trigger.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-betting-kicks-brazil-world-cup/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-hotels-to-surprise-world-cup-fans-with-bitcoin-payments/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ju", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mastercard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaliningrad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T11:49:47.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b97ec1cb3112c064a8a174a3bbcd7296c32eb7b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ojm54QTbouLS5Czntwqzrh3AEE9eH.MvS0NN8UxED.g4642z6PnMzX0WbIYeJ3LN_kJWYAQd9lktf5QSvEqPI5oFrr3nDDiQ-", "site_full": "www.programmingbuddy.club", "site": "programmingbuddy.club", "site_section": "http://www.programmingbuddy.club/", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Programming Buddy Club - Premium Udemy Courses for Free‎", "title": "Primer on Blockchain and Bitcoin: Fundamentals and Use Cases [Udemy Free Coupon - 100% Off]", "title_full": "Primer on Blockchain and Bitcoin: Fundamentals and Use Cases [Udemy Free Coupon - 100% Off]", "published": "2018-05-31T16:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b97ec1cb3112c064a8a174a3bbcd7296c32eb7b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ojm54QTbouLS5Czntwqzrh3AEE9eH.MvS0NN8UxED.g4642z6PnMzX0WbIYeJ3LN_kJWYAQd9lktf5QSvEqPI5oFrr3nDDiQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abhay Talreja (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T16:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Primer on Blockchain and Bitcoin: Fundamentals and Use Cases [Udemy Free Coupon - 100% Off]", "text": "\nLearn the fundamentals of Blockchain and Bitcoin.

It’s only been around for nine years. But we wanted to take a look at just how much investment returns have been moving around if you’ve been in Bitcoin.\nWe took a look at short, medium and the longer term, and yes, it was at $10.00 at one point and it got near $20,000 at one point. Now we’re back down to where we once were, about $7,500 – $8,000. If you got in, say three years ago, back in June of 2015, Bitcoin was around $450 a token. That’s in 3 years. So even with the market moves to the downside over the last couple of months in early of 2018, you still have a $10,000 investment at the time worth $170,000 as of yesterday.\nWe want to then contrast it to the stock market, not because we think they’re comparable in terms of investment or risk or anything else but because other people choose the stock market as a way to invest in anything. Over three years, if you bought the S&P Vanguard ETF, undividend adjusted, just price appreciation, that $10,000 is worth $13,700. That’s pretty good, considering the stock market. We just want to put the context behind the moves we’ve seen.\nIt also calls into question whether or not you’ve held Bitcoin for a long, long time and whether or not you’re still in it. Because if you watch at the highs, that $10,000 at one point was worth 3/4 of a million dollars and it’s now down to $170,000.\nHere are some of the statistics of investments made in Bitcoin today:\nThere’s a total market value is roughly $350 billion. There are about 20 million Bitcoin wallets with a balance greater than $1. Here’s the breakdown of the worlds Bitcoin wealth by dollar and number of wallets: Greater Than 1 USD – 15,505,866 wallets Greater Than 100 USD – 5,169,332 wallets Greater Than 1,000 USD – 2,032,325 wallets Greater Than 10,000 USD – 510,362 wallets Greater Than 100,000 USD – 120,593 wallets Greater Than 1,000,000 USD – 10,919 wallets Greater Than 10,000,000 USD – 1,054 wallets\nBitcoin wallets that are worth $1 million or more own 20% of the entire Bitcoin network. Wallets worth $10 million to $100 million own 38%. And wealthiest individuals that hold $100 million or more own roughly 12% of the worlds Bitcoin wealth.\nPlenty of early Bitcoin investors are holding onto their investment. With plenty of new investors coming into the space each day, Bitcoin is still poised to be a great investment opportunity, especially in comparison to traditional options out there.

Nevertheless, those trader played their necessary role.\nToday, Bitcoin price continued to recover and gained to $7521 dollars. The emerging technical picture suggests that, perhaps, Bitcoin will test the $7800 level in the days to come.\nHowever, there should be a significant surge in volume in the coming trading sessions in order to exceeded the mark of $7800 and test the short-term resistance level of $8500. The recent rally from $7020 up to $7500 was amid a weak volume inflow approximately 10,000 Bitcoins were purchased, which is significantly lower than the volume seen in previous corrective pullbacks. This is a alarming sign, since the growth discussed is not confirmed by a necessary increase in trading volume.\nIf Bitcoin returns down to $7300 and moves again lower to the region of $7020, further decline to a lower level of $6000 will be unavoidable.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:37:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd07f47164bc27555cb50dff08dbe8fa0b4f8cab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRyXrXrI195vlhsk5qLaG9eipVi2WBVUPTISN0brT8W_rXde3IpDTmdyQfjasP0IO9EhtTTGuWppq2aLpYkbfvCU-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "title_full": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst : btc", "published": "2018-05-31T16:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.811, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd07f47164bc27555cb50dff08dbe8fa0b4f8cab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRyXrXrI195vlhsk5qLaG9eipVi2WBVUPTISN0brT8W_rXde3IpDTmdyQfjasP0IO9EhtTTGuWppq2aLpYkbfvCU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EcstaticAudience", "published": "2018-05-31T16:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "text": "submitted by /u/EcstaticAudience\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/buy-bitcoin-sell-your-altcoins-says-pioneering-wall-street-blockchain-analyst"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:46:59.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dde0d5d1ff42038ae58989b3d45c18f260a5569", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7dpGw1lr975hmenZTujZXmBwSzwBmJWRMDmG_Dlh64IH55XkdlUR5wn7Qi_2RNnUMF4.YNg2NVi0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Will Ethereum replace Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Will Ethereum replace Bitcoin?

This month we thought we'd try something a little different. In this issue, we offer how-tos, personal stories, and step-by-step guides for all kinds of activities that can and do happen right at the borders of legally permissible behavior. This month you can learn how to build a gun, live off the grid, hide your bitcoin, make cannabis cocktails, and much more.\nWe put together this illicit issue for several reasons: to show the practical limits of prohibition, to demonstrate the ways the First Amendment supports and protects your other rights, and because it's always valuable to stand at the borders of legality and ask whether those lines have been drawn in the right place. Also, it was fun.\nAs my editor's note explains, these stories are handily packaged into a removable section in the middle of the print magazine. Those of you reading online might want to consider deleting your browser history once you're done.

Both organizations are seeking to develop a stronger, more organized system for allowing charities to accept virtual currency donations.BitGive previously made headlines in October 2017 when it launched its new GiveTrack platform, which uses blockchain technology to clarify and record digital asset donations to global charities. Individuals can trace their funds in real time, and see how their money is spent once an organization receives it. They are also informed of the charity’s project results, creating direct engagement between the donor and the receiver.\nBitGive’s founder Connie Gallippi explained in a statement:\n“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped shape the development of our platform and define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionize the charitable sector.”\nBitGive and the University of Edinburgh are seeking to uncover the challenges of using and converting cryptocurrencies in third-world countries. To do this, BitGive will analyze data collected from GiveTrack’s implementations in nations like Indonesia , Kenya and India to better understand these regions’ levels of cryptocurrency acceptance and feasibility.\nIn addition, both organizations are also hoping collected data will shed light on merchant adoption, regulation, and the effects of cryptocurrencies on local governments and cultures in each country.\nResearch partner at the University of Edinburgh Dr. Claudia Pagliari says:\n“Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through our research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can ultimately influence the success of these approaches so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programs worldwide.”\nOpen Mind Africa\nThis week, BitGive also launched its latest charitable project partnership with Open Mind Africa, aiming to raise funds to support a Summer Camp and Educator Summit in Ghana, where students will have “fantastic opportunities to develop essential social-emotional skills, multiple intelligences, build friendships and make memories that will last a lifetime.” Now in its second year, the camp is also inviting educators and facilitators from the U.S. and Australia , as well as Ghana.\nOpen Mind Africa was founded on a firm belief that there is a better future for Africa if we promote a quality education rooted in essential skills needed to succeed in school, career and life.\nPast projects that BitGive has successfully funded and supported in the past include the Maternal & Neonatal India Program, the Chandolo Primary School Water Project and the Shisango Girls School.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine. 👓 View full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.onenewspage.com/n/Markets/1zj7zf5uay/Bitcoin-Nonprofit-BitGive-Announces-New-Project-and-Research.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "connie gallippi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin nonprofit bitgive announces new project and research collaboration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:08:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14d8bbe7cfd280c8bcee6bbb9042824e70e890fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNFvPZEzMLymI2CZhhORTqFxN83.2GoREdg--", "site_full": "www.techmeme.com", "site": "techmeme.com", "site_section": "http://www.techmeme.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Techmeme", "title": "Cryptocurrency startup Paxos, formerly bitcoin exchange itBit, raises $65M Series B to expand blockchain-based services and operate the exchange (Anna Irrera/Reuters)", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency startup Paxos, formerly bitcoin exchange itBit, raises $65M Series B to expand blockchain-based services and operate the exchange (Anna Irrera/Reuters)", "published": "2018-05-31T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.techmeme.com/img/techmeme_sq328.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17832, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14d8bbe7cfd280c8bcee6bbb9042824e70e890fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNFvPZEzMLymI2CZhhORTqFxN83.2GoREdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency startup Paxos, formerly bitcoin exchange itBit, raises $65M Series B to expand blockchain-based services and operate the exchange (Anna Irrera/Reuters)", "text": " 9:30 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mediagazer.com/#a180531p4", "https://mediagazer.com/#a180530p24"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna irrera/reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T17:12:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "843f5dd9dbbe7e1883fd182d7394b44d96d52d9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbYTvbDDMYd0hPmyqlWXf2M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "title_full": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T16:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "843f5dd9dbbe7e1883fd182d7394b44d96d52d9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbYTvbDDMYd0hPmyqlWXf2M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gathingbrus", "published": "2018-05-31T16:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "text": "Do not bother about it.

Not content with merely adding numbers for their own sake, the company also revealed it would add two new popular coins: bitcoin cash (BCH) and ether (ETH). The technical picture on Bitcoin looks bullish.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price broke the downward channel in the background, which is sign that buyers are in control. I also found a potential end of downward correction (abc) in the background, which is another sign of strength. My advice is to watch for potential buying opportunities.

Bittrex is working with New York-based Signature Bank, which will hold the dollar-denominated funds, along with other financial firms.\n“It’s been a long path,” Bittrex Chief Executive Officer Bill Shihara said in an interview. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nLarger financial institutions, bound to strict government regulations on money laundering and customer verification, have mostly avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that many still associate with criminal activity. As a result, some virtual-currency marketplaces are “crypto-to-crypto” only, meaning that they allow customers to trade using digital money, not dollars.\nSome banks are coming around. Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. crypto trading venues, has developed relationships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S., and recently secured a Barclays PLC bank account in the U.K. Noble Bank International, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, took over banking duties for Bitfinex last year after the exchange was dumped by Wells Fargo & Co., three people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n“They really do look and pore through the entire business,” Shihara said. “They want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.”\nBittrex, which has more than 3 million customers globally, is launching fiat trading on Thursday for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. The service will initially be available only to corporate customers in Washington, California, New York and Montana for regulatory reasons, but the firm said it plans to expand the offering to retail investors eventually.

Let's imagine the most riskiest money deposit situation.\nWhat do you think guys, will this moment ever come and banks decide to offer us Bitcoin deposits (e.g. fixed profit on 1 year deposit and etc).\nThis can be very, very profitable for banks if they make correct decisions.\nP.S I don't mean freebitco.in's offer of holds on their wallet. I mean if official banks ever offer us this service.\nCryptocurrencies are more like Securities or Commodities so their value fluctuates following demand and supply.\nMy answer is banks will not offer BTC deposits. It would be quite enough for me if stock markets offer cryptocurrency trading.\nBanks though can offer a deposit box where you can store your private key on an envelope or nano ledger s\nIt will be more popular and interesting to put bitcoin as commodity and can be traded in commodity trading like stock trading.

This month we thought we'd try something a little different. In this issue, we offer how-tos, personal stories, and step-by-step guides for all kinds of activities that can and do happen right at the borders of legally permissible behavior. This month you can learn how to build a gun, live off the grid, hide your bitcoin, make cannabis cocktails, and much more.\nWe put together this illicit issue for several reasons: to show the practical limits of prohibition, to demonstrate the ways the First Amendment supports and protects your other rights, and because it's always valuable to stand at the borders of legality and ask whether those lines have been drawn in the right place. Also, it was fun.\nAs my editor's note explains, these stories are handily packaged into a removable section in the middle of the print magazine. Those of you reading online might want to consider deleting your browser history once you're done.

Eurozone Crisis: The Italian Job New developments in Italian politics over the last week have raised serious concerns for the Euro Project. While there is still a lot of speculation, several facts are clear. Worrying political tendencies redeveloping in Italy over this last week led to a falling out within parliament. In lockstep with these developments yields on Italian Bonds rose to a disconcerting high of 3.2% on Tuesday, leveling out to a still worrisome value of around 2.7% by Thursday. This alone may not have been reason for the rise in skepticism towards to Euro; however, coupled with the increasing possibility that Italy may soon be forced to hold a new election, which would be little more than a pretense for a referendum about its place in the Eurozone, many are turning to alternative means of exchange in the case of a crisis. Italian Flag Coutesy of JÉSHOOTS Current President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, did his best to maintain a position favoring the Eurozone by appointing, pro-EU economist Carlo Cottarelli to the position of Prime Minister. This decision was met with immediate backlash from the two leading opposition parties within Italy’s controversial new coalition government. Consequently, with no other resolution in sight, Italy may be heading for a new election this fall. Research conducted has shown that the two anti-Eurozone parties, the 5 Star Party and the League, have been gaining traction in the poles. The results of such an election could eventually lead Italy to cede from the Eurozone. House of Cards Euros Courtesy of Skitterphoto For the future of the Euro, and in a broader sense possibly the future of centralized currencies overall, such a result would have serious long-term ramifications. The Eurozone is just not in a position to lose its 3rd largest economy. This was clearly demonstrated earlier this week as the EUR/USD currency pair recoiled from blows to Italian Bond interest rates and dipped to a year low exchange rate of $1.12, with some market analysts speculating a drop as low as $1.10 should the worrying trends in Italian politics continue. The Rise of Alt-Currency Conversely, this week has been a major rallying point for digital currencies. Earlier this year, April 7th, Bitcoin established a new support level at close to $6,500 and then seemingly in light of the turmoil within the Eurozone this week rose sharply from a higher support of around $7,000 on Tuesday, May 29th to $7,500 by Wednesday. This rise of about 5% in a day is a major point of interest. In the same breadth of time that yields on Italian Bonds rose to the detriment of the Euro, Bitcoin, along with other altcoins, gained a net increase in value. Although there are other factors at play on the global stage, the connection between the two does not seem to be trivial. Hourly price movements on the 31st of May 2018 have been quite positive and, though nothing conclusive can be said yet, Bitcoin may be at the start of a new bullish trend. Bitcoin Courtesy of David McBee Cryptocurrencies have demonstrated an extreme susceptibility to volatile behavior. Thus, it is hard to say where they will end up on the global stage in the long term. Yet, since their inception cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have shown an extreme amount of resiliency coupled with an overall trend upwards. While it is becoming a more popular opinion to compare an instrument like Bitcoin to gold, it is still inaccurate to directly equate cryptocurrencies to precious metals. A better analysis is simply that growing distrust in the global public towards any form of establishment, especially in the realms of politics and economics, has led people to find unconventional solutions. Cryptocurrencies and the philosophy of decentralized exchange are emblematic of this. Despite their unpredictable behavior, digital currencies are gaining trust and trust is in many ways a far more valuable asset for any currency, than simply the inertial weight of established bureaucracy.

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nThey are both risky. The only different is that bitcoin offers high interest rate for how many folds unlike banks they only offer very less amount. Bitcoin also has many features compare to the bank. We can big huge profit on bitcoin especially if we will play it on trading site and there are also campaigns that earn bitcoins. So all in all bitcoin has many characteristics that gives people big earnings.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T15:30:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a4bb6a192d978eb9214188c332153c76b580715", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTUpHRLiQmHvj19nc52kLpQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Join Bounty or bitcoin?

Bittrex is working with New York-based Signature Bank , which will hold the dollar-denominated funds, along with other financial firms.\n“It’s been a long path,” Bittrex Chief Executive Officer Bill Shihara said in an interview. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nLarger financial institutions, bound to strict government regulations on money laundering and customer verification, have mostly avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that many still associate with criminal activity. As a result, some virtual-currency marketplaces are “crypto-to-crypto” only, meaning that they allow customers to trade using digital money, not dollars.\nSome banks are coming around. Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. crypto trading venues, has developed relationships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S., and recently secured a Barclays PLC bank account in the U.K. Noble Bank International, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, took over banking duties for Bitfinex last year after the exchange was dumped by Wells Fargo & Co., three people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.

They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.”\nBittrex, which has more than 3 million customers globally, is launching fiat trading on Thursday for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. The service will initially be available only to corporate customers in Washington, California, New York and Montana for regulatory reasons, but the firm said it plans to expand the offering to retail investors eventually.

The biggest cryptocurrency has renewed its flirtation with the $7,000 price level. The slide has helped to also send other digital assets into retreat, with Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin all lower on Wednesday.\nSince failing to regain the psychologically important $10,000 level on May 4, it has closed lower in New York in 12 out of 17 sessions. The hype surrounding last year’s hottest asset class have faded in 2018, with fewer online searches and more pressure for regulators, with technical analysts saying the decline replicates the pattern seen following the collapse of the Mt Gox exchange four years ago.\n“The emotions are no different from the last time this happened, it’s just a different set of people going through it,” said Paul Day, a technical analyst and head of futures and options at Market Securities Dubai Ltd. “We could go down a long, long way.”\nAlso Read: Rs 90 lakh gone as man’s Bitcoin hopes bite dust\nBitcoin on Friday dropped below its average over the previous 252 days, roughly equal to the number of trading days in a year.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 17.3421. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a buy 6 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 35.89. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 42 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -93. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 0 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line.

The lower band is calculated by subtracting a given number of standard deviations from a given moving average. The upper band is calculated by adding the same number of standard deviations to the moving average. The most common parameters are 20 periods for the moving average, and 2 standard deviations, though any other parameters can be used. Sponsored Links Bitcoin Daily Chart – Bollinger Bands\nThere are several ways Bollinger bands can be used by traders, and we highlight four of those methods in the chart above.\nExample 1 : When the price action hugs the upper band, it indicates strongly trending bullish price action. Traders can initiate long positions with a trailing stop. The reverse applies for prices hugging the lower band.\nExample 2 : Short positions can be initiated when the price rejects a downsloping moving average, with a target at the lower band. The reverse applies for long positions and an upsloping moving average.\nExample 3: A change of trend can often be determined when the price first rejects one of the bands and then break through the band at roughly the same level. In this case, the lower Bollinger Band at first provided support, but later gave way indicating the downtrend was now in place.\nExample 4: When the pattern mentioned in the previous example fails to complete, it can confirm continuation of the prior trend. In this case, the price rejected the upper band, and then on the second attempt it failed to touch the upper band, signaling that the market was still weak, and the downtrend was likely to resume. Fibonacci Retracement\nFollowing our previous guide, Fibonacci numbers have numerous applications for traders, but the most common is for identifying potential turning points for retracements. The most common Fibonacci (or Fib) numbers are 38.2% and 61.8%, but 50%, 78.6% and 23.6% numbers also hold occasionally. Litecoin 5-Min Chart\nIn the chart above, for LiteCoin, the price moved from A to B before beginning to retrace. Traders looking for a turning point of the retracement would look for signs of a reversal at 38.2 percent to initiate long positions. If there was no reversal at 38.2%, they would then look for a reversal at 50%, and then at 61.8%.\nIn this case, the price did reverse at 38.2%, setting up a long trade with an initial target at the previous high (B). A common approach would be to close half the position at the high and use a trailing stop on the remainder of the position.\nFib levels are largely psychological. They work because so many traders are watching them, and they work best in the absence of other levels or information. They also tend to repeat – if the first retracement is 38.2%, the second will often also be to 38.2%. Commodity Channel Index\nThe Commodity Channel Index (or CCI) is an oscillator that compares price movements to average price movements and then represents those movements as a value above and below zero. About 80% of price action will keep the CCI between -100 and +100, and any move outside of that range would be viewed as extreme. Bitcoin Cash 30-Min Chart – CCI\nThe most reliable way to trade the CCI is to first identify the trend and then trade in the direction of the trend when there is an extreme move in the opposite direction. In the above example, the trend is down. Short positions are initiated when the CCI crosses above 100 and then crosses back down to below 100. Profits can be taken when the CCI reaches -100, or short positions can be held with a trailing stop loss. Flags and Pennants\nFlags and pennants are continuation patterns that marked as a short consolidation period before the preceding movement continues. The pattern is usually preceded by a sharp increase or decline in the price of the asset. Flags and pennants are often used interchangeably and are named so because of the shape that they form.\nA flag or pennant is formed when the price sharply increases or decreases, followed by a slight sideways movement. This sideways movement can either form rectangular shape, a flag or a small triangle (pennant). The sharp rise or fall in the price before a flag or pennant is known as the flag pole .\nTrend lines are drawn along the highs and lows of the sideways price action to determine the breakout from sideways action. When a breakout occurs, there is a strong move expected following the breakout direction.\nWhen a flag or pennant pattern is observed, the stop loss is usually placed just below the lower trend line, in case of bullish flag. On the other hand, if the price movement is bearish in behavior, then the stop loss is placed just above the flag or pennant.\nTo determine the target price where the trend might break, investors can measure the price of the flag pole and then add this length to the bottom of the flag or pennant, for bullish pattern. In case of bearish pattern, the length of the flag pole is subtracted from the top of the flag or pennant.\nReward potential on trades based on flag/pennant patterns usually outweighs risk by a factor of three indicators or more. Trades should be made on upside breakouts for bullish patterns and downside breakouts for bearish patterns. Pennant pattern in Bitcoin (source: Investopedia.com) Conclusion\nThese are three of the most popular indicators that traders use to identify high probability opportunities to trade. They are also fur different types of indicators. The Bollinger Band considers trend and volatility, Fib levels identify potential turning points based on crowd psychology, and the CCI identifies extreme moves.\nCheck out our previous guide for crypto advanced technical analysis, and also our crypto technical analysis guide for beginners.

Motherboard\nIn today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief we feature news from all over the world. These stories include a new multi-GPU mining motherboard from Taiwan’s Asu; a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin.\nAlso Read: Austrian Financial Market Authority Stops ‘Active Managed Mining’ Operation H370 Mining Master\nAsus (TWSE: 2357), the Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer, has announced a new motherboard that increases density with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The H370 Mining Master greatly replaces its predecessor’s x1 slots with banks of vertical PCIe-over-USB ports that let riser cables plug directly into the motherboard.\nThe company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” The motherboard includes several more mining-enhancing features including a suite of diagnostic features designed to make a rig easier to manage. Chief among them is GPU State Detection, which scans the system at boot and indicates whether each riser port is empty, connected to a functional graphics card, or whether it’s experiencing problems. It will be unveiled at Computex 2018 in Taipei, June 5-9. Real Estate Entrepreneur Buys Bittrade\nSingaporean property entrepreneur Eric Cheng has announced the acquisition of two Japanese companies for S$67 million, giving him a 100% controlling stake in FX Trade Financial and its affiliate Bittrade. Bittrade is one of only sixteen Japanese FSA-regulated cryptocurrency trading platforms. Speaking on the acquisition, Cheng commented: “The cryptocurrency industry is growing exponentially. Against this backdrop, the key to capturing the rising demand is having a well-regulated and licensed outfit. With this Japanese FSA-licensed platform, I will work closely with the regulators to scale this platform globally.” Ripple Loving Bank Hackers\nHackers and ransomware cyber criminals usually prefer privacy coins such as monero, or just BTC to avoid having to explain too much about the crypto markets to their victims. But a new group, possibly from Russia, has been more successful with Ripple’s XRP. According to a report from Canada, an address with about $5 million in XRP is controlled by hackers who recently attacked two banks.\nBank of Montreal (BMO) and Simplii Financial revealed personal information about 90,000 clients of the two banks was being held hostage for $1 million, to be paid in XRP. The hackers, using a Russian email service, explained that the banks’ lack of education security has enabled the situation. “They were giving too much permission to half-authenticated accounts which enabled us to grab all this information,” they said, adding that the system “was not checking if a password was valid until the security questions were input correctly.”\n<span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span> $30 Million Gumi Cryptos\nGumi Cryptos is a new $30 million investment fund meant to help crypto ventures crack the Japanese market. It is led by Hironao Kunimitsu, founder and CEO of Tokyo-based mobile gamer publisher Gumi, and Miko Matsumura, founder of U.S.-based exchange Evercoin.\n“We’ll be bringing startups from outside of Japan to the Japanese market,” Matsumura told Gamesbeat . “We like early stage. We invest in equity or tokens. We like financial services. We like game technologies, and we believe there is a strong connection between gaming and crypto.” He added that “Having advised top global cryptocurrency startups alongside some of the best investors in the world, I’ve come to realize that all of them struggle to break into Japan, the largest cryptocurrency market in the world. I’m excited to join Gumi and their well-respected network in Japan.” James Rodriguez Coin\nColombian soccer star James Rodriguez, currently attacking midfielder for Bayern Munich Football Club, has announced he decided to create a new coin for fans to capitalize on his brand. The JR10 token, developed in collaboration with Selfsell, is planned to be used for exchange of match tickets, souvenirs, and exclusive merchandise as well as the opportunities to participate in Rodriguez’s fan club activities.\nPrevious crypto collaborations by soccer stars include Leo Messi promoting an ultra secure mobile phone for paranoid cryptocurrency users.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?
