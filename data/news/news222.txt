Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.\nDe Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated:\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

I've been banging my head against this for weeks. I run a small crypto consulting business specializing in mining. I'm not even talking about the near impossible task of calculating your tax liability unless you use just one exchange - just good old fashioned bookkeeping is pretty much impossible if you have any inclination towards accepting raw crypto in your business.. The only accounting software that even supports BTC as a currency directly to begin with is Quickbooks Online - and they round everything to two decimal places. Which essentially rounds every transaction to the nearest $100, and transactions below $50 round down to $0 - so it refuses to accept/import them. Which makes that functionality completely useless. So of course I can manually enter the dollar value of the bitcoin when I receive it - which is multiple times a day in small amounts due to mining. And then when if you want to directly spend it....just forget about it. Its not worth it. You'll never be able to keep your books straight ever again, because you have to value the amount spent in USD, not BTC. Literally the only viable option if I want to keep my books straight is to not accept crypto through anything but a payment processor that will immediately convert it to fiat. And that's not what anyone here wants, right? Seriously I can't overemphasize how much of a barrier to adoption this is to business. Its not just about paying the right amount of tax - it makes it impossible to understand the financial state and health of your business when half of your income and assets can't be included in accounting software. And at the end of the day this is nothing more than a computer science problem - its just an impossible burden for a human being. Anyone who writes a plugin to effectively integrate Bitcoin into QBO is my hero forever. Ok, rant over....but seriously you guys, this is like a ridiculously huge problem for adoption. You can do everything in the world to convince people to spend it, but it doesnt matter if business reality effectively forces businesses not to accept it.

IF you have followed bitcoin chart you will notice many of this related patterns.\nSince middle of December that we have a reversals in price of bitcoin and almost all the altcoins, we have seeing a progressive bearish market. Bitcoin is heading toward $4,500 and I hope we are all prepared to buy at the lowest price.\nEntering bitcoin investment really needs a lot of patience and perseverance. We all know that this is a volatile market, anything goes with in a glimpse, price goes up and down periodically without certain specific sign. All we know is something had been very progressive or orthodox happens that surely affects the price. So, it is normal to mind the price, but remain calm in every price movement that we experience.

Prices popped another 138 percent in the two months after the conference.\nIn a note to clients published ahead of this year’s event, Fudstrat predicted a bump “likely greater” than in previous years “given dramatic jump in attendance plus the fact BTC is down YTD.” Instead, prices stayed in the low $8,000 range throughout the week, according to CoinDesk.\nBitcoin hit a high of $8,835 last week before blockchain enthusiasts flocked to New York.

Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.\nDe Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let’s have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the “1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists” with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated:\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

Approximately 200,000 Dutch students are estimated to have taken the OVW exam, a mandatory test for students seeking tertiary education in the Netherlands, which included five bitcoin-themed questions. Also Read: Cryptocurrencies to be Called “Digital Money” in Russia, Tokens – “Digital Rights” Dutch High School Examinations Feature Bitcoin-Themed Maths Questions According to a rough translation of the examination paper circulating on Reddit , students were given the following question introduction: “Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It has existed since January 1st, 2009, and can be used as payment method in webstores and for other online services. Bitcoin is not, like standard money, made by a central bank. Instead, all bitcoin that exist are created by having computers participate in solving specific mathematical problems. This works as follows: everyone can run special software on his or her computer that participates in solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. Because it was the case that in 2014 such a problem is solved every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins were created every 10 minutes. On January 1st, there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoin.” Following from the preceding introduction, students were asked to solve five different mathematical problems. The questions asked that students “calculate in what year the amount of bitcoin exceeded 18 million,” “calculate from which year on the reward will be less than one bitcoin,” “determine the maximal amount of bitcoin that can be in circulation,” in addition to posing addition problems based on the formula used to employed to solve the aforementioned questions. Netherlands Warming to Cryptocurrency The test has been offered to students following increasing recognition of cryptocurrency on the part of Holland’s institutions. During March , the Court of Amsterdam determined that bitcoin possesses “properties of wealth” whilst adjudicating a civil rights case between an individual seeking repayment from an unfulfilled contract pertaining to bitcoin mining. The court concluded that “bitcoin represents a value and is transferable” and “thus shows characteristics of a property right. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is, therefore, to be regarded as a claim that qualifies for verification.” Earlier this month, the ambassador of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, Rob van Gijzel, presented a national blockchain research agenda , which had been commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. The ministry had created a designated committee, TopTeam ICT, tasked with analyzing the potential legal, economic, and ethical implications of distributed ledger technology in the Netherlands.

From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future. The Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly. While other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy. Fintech Revolution The number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018. In Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people. Price Resilience Bitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals. Bitcoin Price for the Last Three Months Adoption by Mainstream Finance Bitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading. 2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market. Do you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market? Let us know in the comment section below.

The bearish pressure is not relenting by any means, as market makers are intent on keeping the prices down for some time to come. With the Bitcoin price now dropping below $8,200, it seems to be a matter of time until the value dips below $8,000 once again. That would certainly trigger an even bigger sell-off in the altcoin department. Bitcoin Price Trend Becomes Worrisome It has been documented over the past few months how the Bitcoin price is seemingly incapable of catching a break. No solid positive momentum has been achieved at this stage, and it seems things will not necessarily improve in the near future either. The past three months have seen some attempts at recovering losses, but ultimately seem to result in lower lows for the Bitcoin price. More specifically, three months ago, the Bitcoin price was hovering near the $12,0000 mark. Ever since that time, it has dipped below $11,000, then $10,000, and even hit $7,200 a few weeks later. While that is still the proverbial bottom as of right now, it remains to be determined if any positive momentum can be generated before the year 2018 comes to a close. The current trend doesn’t look all that promising so far, but things are always subject to change in the world of cryptocurrency. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has lost another 1.95% of its value. This decline pushes the price per BTC below $8,200, and will seemingly result in a price dip below $8,000 by the time the weekend has come to a close. It remains unclear what is causing all of this negative Bitcoin price pressure this year, but it seems evident things will not improve anytime soon. Even the Bitcoin trading volume is on the decline as of late, which is anything but promising. More specifically, the trading volume has dropped to $8.894bn, which is $2bn below what one would expect to see these days. This seems to indicate the overall demand for the world’s leading cryptocurrency is on the decline, which doesn’t bode well for Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency on the market these days. OKEx is still leading the charge in terms of Bitcoin trading volume, which is a bit surprising. Its USDT pair remains extremely popular and is well ahead of Bitfinex’s USD pair and the USDT market on Binance. All three platforms generate over $215m in 24-hour volume, which is rather interesting to keep an eye on. With Huobi and OKEx’s TRUE pair in the five as well, there is only one fiat currency market to speak of. That can prove to be problematic for the Bitcoin price moving forward. Whether or not the Bitcoin price can recover from this latest setback, remains to be determined. Anything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency these days, even though the current trend looks anything but promising. Then again, the weekend is usually very different from the rest of the week when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, and this weekend may prove to be somewhat interesting in this regard. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:45:26.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7ab591fbb615772ba467b0a951e9263d56f67ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCRVavE.7LMpr5kZiBpPpXUl_7NlXRnwA6DkV9v7JVB137.YmE962nXnH8zdSIRb_P7HWRUPkIAGKqmzWVcKz0pV9SaQ0MCieH6ymVHq6HvJo-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Alibaba’s Jack Ma Joins the Bitcoin Bashing Brigade but Backs Blockchain", "title_full": "Alibaba’s Jack Ma Joins the Bitcoin Bashing Brigade but Backs Blockchain", "published": "2018-05-18T20:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7ab591fbb615772ba467b0a951e9263d56f67ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCRVavE.7LMpr5kZiBpPpXUl_7NlXRnwA6DkV9v7JVB137.YmE962nXnH8zdSIRb_P7HWRUPkIAGKqmzWVcKz0pV9SaQ0MCieH6ymVHq6HvJo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T20:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Alibaba’s Jack Ma Joins the Bitcoin Bashing Brigade but Backs Blockchain", "text": "2 hours ago Crypto World News CryptoCoinNews 70 Jack Ma has joined the bitcoin bashing brigade, although he remains keen on blockchain.

Price Highs = Employment Highs According to new research from “augmented writing” startup Textio, job offers relating to Blockchain and cryptocurrency rise and fall entirely depending on how valuable Bitcoin is in USD terms. Researchers analyzed job advertisements containing various terms, including Bitcoin, altcoin, cryptocurrency, crypto, cryptographic hash, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and decentralized currency. Between May 2017 and February 2018, offers peaked in the third week of December, at a time when BTC/USD reached its all-time highs of around $20,000. Textio concludes the findings are proof of “how fast and fickle the job market is when it comes to hot technologies.” “…Textio found that Crypto jobs rise and fall with bitcoin currency price. However, since the crash, interest in blockchain jobs has fallen harder and stayed down for longer than bitcoin itself,” it summarized. So if you’re looking for cryptocurrency jobs, watch the price of Bitcoin and make your move. No One Wants To Earn The Dip Bitcoinist found that not only job offers but jobseekers come and go as Bitcoin fluctuates. According to data from Google Trends for ‘bitcoin jobs,’ search requests similarly reached a head in December 2017, only to disappear in the coming months. The Philippines contributed the majority of interest from internet users, followed by Australia, the UK, Pakistan and Canada. Bitcoinist further reported on the scale of the boom in job offers at the time of the price highs, with November seeing a surge of almost 6000% in vacancies with “bitcoin” in the title. “In an industry as new as cryptocurrency, I would expect fluctuations in the pace of job opening growth and of growth in job applicant pool,” a recruitment consultant meanwhile said at the time, foreseeing the subsequent volatility in the market.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus — which represents revolution and change — from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they’re moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it’s not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter — proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he trusts.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,” he said. “Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines earlier this month for the same reason: he bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shake-up is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on compelling zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n“My dad studied astrology and I’ve been learning about it for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,” he said. “Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.”\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst — which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors — said he expects bitcoin to fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his customers they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77 % of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based on astrology alone.\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,” he told MarketWatch.\nMerriman trusts planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius — a sign of “new ideas and machines.” From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20 percent of investors at large firms make decisions based on horoscopes — a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults trust astrology is a science. Merriman himself has more than 1,000 customers and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n“It doesn’t worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,” he said. “If you look at the correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you’d be amazed.”\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women’s website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,” she said. “Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don’t. Founders of famous astrology app Co-star told Market Watch they shy away from any type of financial advice because it can have major effects on people’s lives. Still, Gat noted, it’s a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n“Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,” she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment":

But unlike any top-tier event, you were invited … if you could afford it.\nAt approximately $2,000, Consensus 2018 was the most expensive edition in the bitcoin conference’s history. Despite that, it was the most heavily attended by a country mile.\nFounded by CoinDesk, Consensus 2018 drew 8,500 attendees, an all-time record. Last year’s haul topped out at 2,700 people, which was a respectable figure at that time, representing a near-doubling from Consensus 2016. But at a growth rate of 215%, this year’s edition took the bitcoin conference to a whole new level.\nUsually, cryptocurrency-related events are self-serving. Nothing new is learned because the people attending don’t have to be sold on anything. Most are already steeped in the bitcoin culture. What made Consensus 2018 stand out was its diversity. Not everyone was a believer, and even among the faithful, not everyone saw eye to eye.\nMost importantly, Consensus 2018 proved that the bitcoin ecosystem was far more than just speculators looking to profit. Here’s a deeper look at the bitcoin conference and the issues presented. Reason #1: Bulls Go to Bat for Bitcoin\nWith the way the mainstream media has portrayed bitcoin and the blockchain as a wildly speculative venture, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ) chairman and chief executive Fred Smith’s words may come as a surprise . Smith matter-of-factly states, “Blockchain has the potential to completely revolutionize what’s across the border.”\nHe further doubled-down on the blockchain technology and its implications. In front of a packed audience, he stated , “For cross-border shipments, ‘trust’ is legal requirement for every transaction. What blockchain has is a potential for the first time ever to make the information available for everybody.”\nIn terms of the logistics business, Smith’s support for blockchain is completely understandable. One of the biggest challenges with international shipments is dealing with differences: different regulations, operating protocols, industry-specific terminologies and cultural expectations.\nAnything that can standardize the logistics platform would go a long way in making the overall process more efficient. Thus, the FedEx CEO praised the blockchain technology’s “chain of custody.” Put another way, the blockchain allows everyone to speak one language.\nPerhaps the most significant aspect of FedEx’s love affair with the blockchain is that it’s not just lip service. The company joined the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA) in an effort to explore how blockchain applications can positively impact the logistics industry.\nI’m biased, of course, but FedEx is making the right, and necessary, decision. The company’s CIO, Fred Carter, stated:\n“We move easily 12 million shipments a day and that more than doubles during the peak seasons. While we absolutely believe this technology is going to scale, right now it makes sense for us to do this in our freight world.” Reason #2: Blockchain Has Practical Utility\nCarter hits upon a critical point. While the general public’s idea about cryptocurrencies centers on speculative financial investments, and 20-year old kids driving Lambos, what gets lost in the discussion is that the blockchain has practical utility.\nYes, everyone talks about the soaring bitcoin price, and it’s true that overnight millionaires have sprouted across the world. In its initial launch, the original cryptocurrency could have been purchased for under a buck.\nBut at the end of the day, cryptocurrencies are blockchain reward tokens. Bitcoin’s highly speculative market value is a separate issue from the underlying blockchain technology. That’s why I’m glad Consensus 2018 featured FedEx. Their executives understand what so many fail to see.\nRegarding Carter’s point, his organization is already operating at the highest level. Yet shipping demand will only increase. The advent of e-commerce, and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) dominance, in particular, will continue to shift consumer behavior.\nAs I mentioned in my recent write-up for Amazon, the company’s Prime membership comprises consumers of all income levels. Furthermore, the difference between Amazon’s affluent and lower-income consumers isn’t nearly as lopsided as you might imagine. I wrote:\nAs expected, the affluent find enormous value in Prime. Approximately 70% of people who earn $150,000 or more, and who shop online, are Prime members. Moreover, over half of online customers who make between $50,000 and $125,000 are also active Prime users. This broad income bracket essentially represents most upscale retailers’ target demographic.\nPut another way, the vast majority of consumers love shopping at Amazon, and love shopping online in general. Both FedEx and its rival United Parcel Service, Inc . (NYSE: UPS ) should experience a demand boon in upcoming years.\nAnd that means both companies need a next-generation innovation to keep up. Reason #3: Blockchain Will Cause Trickle-Down Effect\nGranted, Amazon is currently experimenting with their own courier system , and that could impinge on FedEx and UPS revenues. While it’s not the greatest thing to happen for couriers, I wouldn’t get too worried. Here’s what I wrote at the time:\n“However, I think the bearishness is overplayed. While Amazon could theoretically replace UPS and similar services, it would be a massive undertaking. The longer-term benefit for AMZN in terms of reducing shipping costs could be outweighed due to the onerous investment. From an economies of scale perspective, it may make sense for Amazon to continue utilizing UPS.”\nBut the greater point is that no one entity can possibly handle the demand surge. My InvestorPlace colleague Will Ashworth, with regards to Amazon’s proposed internal courier service, stated, “I just don’t think that’s feasible or sensible given Amazon’s real business is selling 100 million Prime members as many things as possible.”\nExactly. This isn’t a knock on Amazon, of which I’ve been especially bullish. But as great as they are, they couldn’t possibly cover all the gaps.\nNext, you have to consider the competition. Big-box retailers Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT ) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) have aggressively pushed into the e-commerce market . Their efforts will continue with the same, if not increased, aggression.\nI admit that Walmart hasn’t demonstrated ideal results late last year, which is why WMT stock has skidded. However, operational issues impeded their progress. Translation: Walmart perhaps bit off more than it can chew.\nBut the challenges of e-commerce make one thing clear. Consumers increasingly prefer online retail, and current solutions aren’t working effectively.\nThis is a perfect opportunity for the blockchain to flex its muscles. Eventually, other companies will have to embrace it, or slowly fade away. Reason # 4: Blockchain Forces Companies to Adapt … or Die\nFedEx CEO Fred Smith had one final comment at Consensus 2018. He stated:\n“If you are not operating at the edge of new technologies, you will surely be disrupted. If you are not willing to embrace new technologies like internet of things and blockchain to face those new threats, you are, maybe subtly, at some point … going to extinction.”\nI find myself marveling at FedEx’s leadership team. Unlike so many other executives and mainstream pundits, Smith discerns the strawman arguments used against bitcoin.\nAs I stated earlier, bitcoin’s speculative trading and its underlying blockchain technology are completely separate issues. That the bitcoin price is as wild as a penny stock has nothing to do with the blockchain’s utilitarian value.\nWhat many critics miss is that you don’t have to ever invest in cryptocurrencies to benefit from the blockchain. The price of bitcoin could fall to zero, which I highly doubt. Yet even in that draconian circumstance, I believe that Pandora’s box has already been opened. Once people see what’s possible, there’s no going back.\nFurthermore, most companies will eventually be forced to adapt to the blockchain, or die. As enterprising businesses advantage the new technology’s utility, they’ll get a head start in their industry. By adopting an irrationally negative attitude toward the blockchain, competitors risk obsolescence.\nTo be clear, I’m not suggesting that the blockchain is a cure-all for any company. If a business is a failing one, a new technology would only decelerate its inevitable demise. But for an organization not to try based on precontrived feelings would be the height of folly. Reason #5: Even Bitcoin Critics Will Turn Around\nCurrently, cryptocurrency critics will note that the bitcoin price has fallen sharply since Consensus 2018 started. If the biggest crypto proponents can’t pump up the digital markets, who can?\nFair enough. However, I wouldn’t be too comfortable taking potshots at bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be more resilient than people give them credit for. In addition, things will eventually turn around in the right direction.\nHow can I be so sure? Because even the haters realize that their derision toward cryptocurrencies lacks common and business sense. Compare it to tulip bubbles all you want. All the criticisms in the world have been widely disseminated through the internet. Not a single, unique argument against bitcoin exists because we’ve heard every one.\nYet in this hate-filled environment, the haters are backing away from their reproach.\nI’m speaking of course about Facebook, Inc . (NASDAQ: FB ). Earlier this year, the social media giant announced a draconian ban on all cryptocurrency-related advertisements. It was one of the biggest knee-jerk reactions in recent memory.\nWith Facebook, I understood their concerns. Several cryptocurrency-related projects are indeed scams. But I could say the same thing about other projects and businesses, including publicly traded companies. Rather than blame individual con-artists, Facebook took the easy way out and accused the platform.\nThat was a big mistake, and they know it. Now, they’re exploring how the blockchain technology can aid their business. Facebook could’ve saved themselves much embarrassment and at least stayed neutral. Reason #6: More Companies to Get Bitcoin Fever\nIf Consensus 2018 has taught us anything, it’s that bitcoin is no longer for nerds. FedEx executives just went to bat for the blockchain. This is no longer a niche market you can simply ignore.\nI’m even more bullish on bitcoin, if such a thing is possible. That’s because the immense popularity over Consensus 2018 is just the beginning. More companies will follow FedEx’s lead. But just as importantly, more companies will follow Facebook’s lead.\nInitially, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) adopted Facebook’s early stance on cryptocurrencies. The former two companies banned crypto-related advertisements I suppose as a show of solidarity.\nThey too will regret their hasty and illogical decisions.\nI genuinely don’t care what any Alphabet executive personally thinks about bitcoin; by refusing crypto-related advertisements, they’re throwing free money away. Last year, “bitcoin” was one of the top Googled search items . I can virtually guarantee you that it will remain highly popular for years to come. Thus, it makes zero sense to ban advertisements for a subject everyone is talking about.\nA few months back, I happened to watch CNBC ’s Mad Money. Jim Cramer briefly discussed cryptocurrencies. I normally don’t get my financial advice from Cramer, and this time was no different. But what intrigued me was that his friends called him up to ask about bitcoin.\nI don’t know Jim Cramer, but he doesn’t strike me as a bitcoin guy. So if Cramer’s friends who are probably stodgy, stocks and bonds type of folks, are bugging him about bitcoin, imagine the conversations occurring on Main Street.\nAnd if anyone wants to learn about bitcoin, Google is the first site they’ll go. That means the company will idly watch easily convertible metrics slip by. It’s insane, and they’ll soon recant. Not Everything Was Rosy for Consensus 2018\nBy almost any reasonable standard, Consensus 2018 was a huge success. Bitcoin received unprecedented attention and credibility. Like I said earlier, this sector is no longer just for computer nerds. It’s hit the big-time in the Big Apple.\nBut not everything about Consensus 2018 was a standout success. In some ways, this bitcoin conference was defined not by who was there, but who wasn’t. And Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin’s absence was especially conspicuous.\nTo get a ticket to the event at the last minute will cost you $3,000. That’s roughly one-third the cost of a single bitcoin. Buterin took exception to this highway robbery, stating simply, “I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent-seeking.”\nI can understand why he was upset. As one of the blockchain space’s most prominent and accomplished figures, I appreciated his standing up for the little guys.\nConsensus 2018 offered valuable content and insights; that, no one will argue against. But the hoopla and extracurricular activities were something the conference could do without. For instance, the parading of the Lamborghinis was tacky. It screams desperation and insecurity. In my opinion, it was a bad look for the cryptocurrency sector’s marquee event.\nMore critically, Buterin may have been concerned that the blockchain was losing its ideological base. What should be celebrated was not crass commercialism, but rather, the blockchain’s ability to open doors. As it has done for the logistics business, cryptocurrencies offer trading based on a neutral platform.\nIn other words, people can finally invest outside the U.S. dollar hegemony. This puts emerging-market investors on the same floor as American or western investors. Yet the Lambo parade suggested that bitcoin proponents could care less about the blockchain’s social impact. Consensus 2018 Lacked Consensus\nIndeed, one of the ironic characteristics about Consensus 2018 was that it lacked exactly that: consensus. Don’t get me wrong — most people at the conference support bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. But this did not involve folks preaching to the choir.\nGoing back to Buterin, he complained that Consensus 2018 founder CoinDesk lacked integrity. The Ethereum founder claimed that CoinDesk resorts to “gotcha” tactics for its off-the-record policy.\nObviously, I can’t corroborate Buterin’s accusation. However, his statements indicate that the blockchain space has substantial room for further maturing. For instance, a CNBC reporter had to wait over an hour to get her entrance badge.\nNor was this an isolated case. Several attendees, irrespective of status, also waited an hour to gain admission. In fact, Consensus 2018 had to start the day with an apology for operational inefficiencies.\nFireworks also erupted on the panel floor. Prominent blockchain business owners engaged in heated debates over the crypto sector’s direction. One side felt that the sector was hitting a bubble, that too many blockchain projects were speculative. The other side disagreed sharply, ultimately ending the feud with a bitcoin bet.\nThe details of this debate don’t really interest me. Rather, I find it intriguing that wildly successful bitcoin adopters still sharply disagree about bitcoin. I also find this dynamic encouraging.\nYou’ll often hear critics state that cryptocurrencies are the modern-day tulip bubbles. But if that were the case, why the robust debates within the sector? I’d understand if the counterarguments originated from outside the bitcoin love-fest. But they’re not. Some of the biggest bitcoin supporters are also its biggest critics.\nLast time I checked, bubbles occur because most everyone believes the only direction is up. At Consensus 2018, no such consensus existed. The Bankers Have Their Say\nFor me, the biggest surprise of the bitcoin conference was St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard. He attended Consensus 2018, and it went down how you might imagine it. Bullard stated to the audience:\nYou’ve got this kind of special problem of who’s going to issue the currency and what are those promises about future issuance and can you really maintain the credibility of those promises. If you can’t, the value of your currency is going to zero the same way the Venezuelan bolivar has.\nBullard further noted that non-uniform currencies have historically met significant resistance, and later failed. In his view, cryptocurrencies have a challenged road ahead before they can achieve mainstream financial acceptance. “They’ve got to compete just like everybody else…welcome to the currency competition game,” Bullard said.\nRespectfully, but unfortunately, the Fed banker misses the point. Cryptocurrencies represent a paradigm shift in how we view money. To merely categorize them as “non-uniform currencies” is a grave disservice, if not disinformation.\nThe value of the dollar doesn’t just stem from U.S. economic stability; rather, our military backs our currency. Recall that when Admiral Perry opened Japan’s borders , he did so with battleships. Currencies, particularly western currencies, have always been inked with blood.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, doesn’t threaten anyone. It merely encourages through unprecedented opportunities. The value of bitcoin in Nigeria is the same as the value of bitcoin in Norway. All participants operate on the same platform with the same rules. The blockchain doesn’t consider any other factor, such as skin color or national allegiances.\nPut another way, people want to use bitcoin. In sharp contrast, people are forced to use the dollar. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin and Consensus 2018\nConsensus 2018 had its fair share of problems. The organizers clearly didn’t prepare adequately for the popularity surge, and frankly, they have no excuse. Ticket-buyers didn’t just pop up randomly; ample time was in place for proper administration and procedures.\nI also wasn’t impressed with Consensus 2018 not taking care of its media guests. Again, you can’t excuse organizers not having made prior arrangements for CNBC and other financial/business journalists. These are the folks to fast-track as they will relay their opinions to everyone else.\nAfter all, Consensus 2018 is typically the only time in the year that outsiders can glimpse inside the crypto world. For this audience, you want to present the best image possible. Instead, it looked like amateur hour.\nThat said, the annual bitcoin conference achieved what all cryptocurrency proponents have sought: mainstream acceptance and credibility. Bitcoin started off as a get-rich-quick scheme. Now, its underlying technology made the most powerful names in business take notice.\nNot only that, but the diversity of opinions suggests that we’re still a long way from the dreaded bitcoin bubble. As I stated earlier, Consensus 2018 was marked for the lack of consensus.\nMoreover, the conference organizers’ clumsy operations has a silver lining. If the conference itself was surprised at the attendee number, imagine what the next year will bring.\nAt time of writing, the bitcoin price is almost 60% lower than its all-time high. In any other asset, such losses would cause severe panic. But not the cryptocurrency sector. This market has seen the worst of times, yet its proponents keep coming back for more.\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long bitcoin and ethereum.\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2018/05/consensus-2018-proves-bitcoin-come-age/.\n©2018 InvestorPlace Media, LLC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/05/15/consensus-2018-what-youve-missed-so-far-from-the-biggest-bitcoin-event/#342a5ce761ac", "https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bitcoin/bitcoin-today-prices-dip-as-opinion-leader-thoughts-diverge-14590319", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/new-york-cryptocurrency-conference-triples-in-size-tracking-for-17-million-in-ticket-sales.html", "http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1750_perry.htm", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-among-years-top-searches-google-data-says/", "https://www.coindesk.com/fedex-ceo-adopt-new-tech-like-blockchain-or-be-disrupted/", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "http://bit.ly/2IxbUMU"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T20:16:21.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a48a5487573059cb1bc39a8f96dc82f658cc1919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3EUrNOQWaS4.bba_fJRIa_6eCzd3g_beeVc61L0N_iYHgANUZEHZMnc_ytZwHuxxXNoI2NZxRnLZPPOGRrwOd48JldAPsSqzGa8J_wBNyvQ--", "site_full": "nypost.com", "site": "nypost.com", "site_section": "https://nypost.com/", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "New York Post", "title": "People are buying bitcoin because of a shift in Uranus", "title_full": "People are buying bitcoin because of a shift in Uranus", "published": "2018-05-18T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.728, "main_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/180518-uranus-shift-causing-people-buy-bitcoin-feature.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 41, "comments": 0, "shares": 41}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a48a5487573059cb1bc39a8f96dc82f658cc1919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3EUrNOQWaS4.bba_fJRIa_6eCzd3g_beeVc61L0N_iYHgANUZEHZMnc_ytZwHuxxXNoI2NZxRnLZPPOGRrwOd48JldAPsSqzGa8J_wBNyvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kari Paul, Marketwatch", "published": "2018-05-18T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "People are buying bitcoin because of a shift in Uranus", "text": "The stars are aligning for big gains in bitcoin, astrologers claim, and some investors are actually following that out-of-this-world advice.\nWhen Chicago-based investor Marcus Thomas first heard about cryptocurrency in 2017, he was skeptical. “I couldn’t understand how something digital could have any value like the dollar, gold or silver,” he said.\nBut he has since invested more than $11,000 in cryptocurrencies — in part because astrologers said it was a good idea. People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus — which represents revolution and change — from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they’re moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it’s not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter — proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he believes.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,” he said. “Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines earlier this month for the same reason: He bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shakeup is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on significant zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n“My dad studied astrology and I’ve been learning about it for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,” he said. “Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.”\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst — which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors — said he expects bitcoin to fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his clients they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77 percent of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based on astrology alone.\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,” he told MarketWatch .\nMerriman believes planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement , which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late ’90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius — a sign of “new ideas and machines.” From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20 percent of investors at large firms make decisions based on horoscopes — a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults believe astrology is a science . Merriman himself has more than 1,000 clients and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n“It doesn’t worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,” he said. “If you look at the correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you’d be amazed.”\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women’s website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,” she said. “Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don’t. Founders of popular astrology app Co-star told MarketWatch they shy away from any kind of financial advice because it can have major effects on people’s lives. Still, Gat noted, it’s a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n“Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,” she said.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advent-of-bitcoin-futures-sparked-the-selloff-from-20000-says-san-francisco-fed-2018-05-07", "https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=4", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bring-back-the-gold-standard-this-is-what-happened-the-last-time-the-world-tried-it-2016-08-10", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html", "https://nyp.st/2wQQklh", "https://nyp.st/2KBpSxW", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-are-ditching-religion-for-witchcraft-and-astrology-2017-10-20", "https://nyp.st/2wRDd30&#038;appId=823934954307605"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:19:45.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd5990ba533429e6138c438a12e00c9a69aebd26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSqdrrvfAmEpwz29c9TOzrM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Many Country's Government think Bitcoin is a Illegal?", "title_full": "Why Many Country's Government think Bitcoin is a Illegal?", "published": "2018-05-18T19:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd5990ba533429e6138c438a12e00c9a69aebd26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSqdrrvfAmEpwz29c9TOzrM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "reverseflash", "published": "2018-05-18T19:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Many Country's Government think Bitcoin is a Illegal?", "text": "Quote: from: akashark on December 11, 2017, 08:46:58 PM Bitcoin is a coin which is Precious more than Lord Of The Rings But I don't know why many county's governments prohibiting Bitcoin and they think it's illegal.

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking.\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with the logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement. While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nThe Rest… HERE 12:44 pm and is filed under Economics ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://news.goldseek.com/GoldSeek/1526646417.php"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T20:09:28.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a029cc34858c0b35d01691368eeb2540718d27d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtw3XCxUsNFSaEvnq4VL3F32UhCX0vasPqaGP0dBsTE4.tPp1cOHDCXCNgmd.lE52me2VRlqwqaLx6HONSmn1jmvZ71DtGQrTbdpa9vsosdeqynqWMEaowXg--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: 1 in 5 financial institutions want to invest in cryptocurrencies, surely a great sign for the future", "title_full": "Bitcoin: 1 in 5 financial institutions want to invest in cryptocurrencies, surely a great sign for the future", "published": "2018-05-18T19:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a029cc34858c0b35d01691368eeb2540718d27d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtw3XCxUsNFSaEvnq4VL3F32UhCX0vasPqaGP0dBsTE4.tPp1cOHDCXCNgmd.lE52me2VRlqwqaLx6HONSmn1jmvZ71DtGQrTbdpa9vsosdeqynqWMEaowXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-18T19:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: 1 in 5 financial institutions want to invest in cryptocurrencies, surely a great sign for the future", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T20:16:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78339888b5aae49f2a841d8bbb8559a1c3a9ce6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTnCGSdDpOmrZw7HKPRfCQ8mu2jn9Gz1LyPcl7Rs20U8hp51dROmAyqU8gZz4fDRHL3LLmnv_fQGIQJVn3lC1NY", "site_full": "cellphoneforums.net", "site": "cellphoneforums.net", "site_section": "http://cellphoneforums.net/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "cell_phones", "sports", "tech", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cell Phone Forums", "title": "bitcoin vs onecoin", "title_full": "bitcoin vs onecoin", "published": "2018-05-18T19:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 87465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78339888b5aae49f2a841d8bbb8559a1c3a9ce6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTnCGSdDpOmrZw7HKPRfCQ8mu2jn9Gz1LyPcl7Rs20U8hp51dROmAyqU8gZz4fDRHL3LLmnv_fQGIQJVn3lC1NY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AizaKhan", "published": "2018-05-18T19:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin vs onecoin", "text": "which one is batter for investment\nbitcoin or onecoin ?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wai", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T00:35:27.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "436b00fee28809f7667e122b86b18b9e9186f366", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46XIXp7qcxpAZghfdKA9jRQQ--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Batch -

REUTERS/Mike Segar\nBy Anna Irrera and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfus NEW YORK (Reuters) Square Inc’s decision to allow users of its mobile app to buy and sell bitcoin this year was a “pretty contentious move within the company” and remains a source of internal tension, the payment processor’s CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday\nSpeaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc, reiterated his support for the virtual coin , but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board.\n“We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology,” Dorsey said. “There is still a lot of skepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.”\nHe added that the “healthy discussion” around bitcoin extended “all the way at the board level”, without elaborating on specifics.\nEmbed from Getty Images\nIn January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin .\nThe company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.\nProponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply\nBut it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility , slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability.\nThe volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets. The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast , said he believes the internet will have its own “native currency.” He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. “I am a huge fan,” he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n“If we were able to use it as a currency today (…) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,” he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O’Brien) --", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/826429950"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna irrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters) square inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T00:48:03.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c859b2173b86f46acb4544dcadd1aaa1c271aed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Ysax3gl6yjYjM6M1v86jk8B8FIhOdiSUmFYq3dMTB5r0N0ST0YxVMskJFy4XVopRG2WbWkF9s0vjfpy7Jg_SEP68eO2aZDY1WsI6wSK6fPmnrkC3.J_dJn3VomFbbgE4-", "site_full": "www.govtech.com", "site": "govtech.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/govtech/top_news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Government Technology News", "title": "Seminole County, Fla., Becomes First to Try Taking Payment by Bitcoin — Sort of", "title_full": "Seminole County, Fla., Becomes First to Try Taking Payment by Bitcoin — Sort of", "published": "2018-05-18T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.centerdigitaled.com/images/shutterstock_608089037.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c859b2173b86f46acb4544dcadd1aaa1c271aed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Ysax3gl6yjYjM6M1v86jk8B8FIhOdiSUmFYq3dMTB5r0N0ST0YxVMskJFy4XVopRG2WbWkF9s0vjfpy7Jg_SEP68eO2aZDY1WsI6wSK6fPmnrkC3.J_dJn3VomFbbgE4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ben Miller", "published": "2018-05-18T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Seminole County, Fla., Becomes First to Try Taking Payment by Bitcoin — Sort of", "text": "Seminole County, Fla., Becomes First to Try Taking Payment by Bitcoin — Sort of The county expects the new system to be faster and cheaper than regular card payments. by Ben Miller / May 18, 2018 Shutterstock\nSeminole County, Fla., will soon become probably the first local government in the U.S. to accept payments from citizens in Bitcoin, as well as its cousin cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash.\nSort of.\nIt’s not that Joel Greenberg, the county’s tax collector behind the initiative, is going to direct his office to actually start stockpiling Bitcoin from the residents and businesses that send in money for everything from property taxes to concealed carry permits.

All told, the office handles close to $1 billion each year.\nFor BitPay, the transaction fee is 1 percent. Of course, a customer has to pay a transaction fee to buy cryptocurrency in the first place.\nThe crypto payments should also get to Greenberg’s office faster.

This issue is the largest threat to the credibility, widespread adoption, and the acknowledgment of blockchain. DESICO will address these obstacles by creating the necessary infrastructure to issue, buy, and sell security tokens in full compliance with the law.\n18th May 2018, Vilnius, Lithuania – Many token sales these days issue utility tokens. However, they make promises to token buyers that only security tokens are able to deliver. For example, there are numerous token sale events that have raised millions of US dollars by promising part of their income or revenue to their utility token holders. This is the reason why in mid-2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, began a crackdown not only on these borderline-fraudulent token sales, but also on the token sale industry as a whole.\nThis is why experts agree that security tokens are crypto’s next megatrend. Only the lack of necessary infrastructure is what is currently stopping their widespread adoption.\n“Everybody in the blockchain community agrees that security tokens are the future of crypto,” said DESICO founder, Laimonas Noreika. “Unfortunately, the lack of legal frameworks and infrastructure to issue security tokens is why we do not see any security token crowdsales. DESICO will change this by creating the world’s first platform to issue, buy, and sell security tokens in full compliance with the law.”\nHow it Works\nThe DESICO ecosystem will include a regulated crowdfunding platform to issue security tokens, and an exchange that will provide liquidity to security tokens issued via DESICO from day one. DESICO will also have a payment system based on the European e-money licence. This means that it will able to provide token sales with IBAN accounts from the very first day they become listed on the DESICO platform.\nDESICO has been praised by the Head of the Nordic Crowdfunding Alliance, Dr. Rotem Shneor, who tipped it to be a future “international champion” for equity crowdfunding.\nBusinesses from all over the world will be eligible to issue security tokens via DESICO. DESICO is conducting its global operations from Lithuania, a European Union and Eurozone member state.

One is just simply riding on the other.\nNow, it appears, Bautista's position has softened, bringing UnionBank beyond the level of participation of the majority of legacy financial institutions, which have stuck rigidly to Blockchain evangelism.\nThe major exception to date has been Switzerland, where banks have actively offered Bitcoin-based products since 2016 in what has become a highly-supportive environment for cryptocurrency usage.\nWhat do you think about UnionBank's Bitcoin mining?

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration The value of the net short dollar position was $9.82 billion in the week ended May 15, from $10.84 billion the previous week. The net short dollar position has declined for four straight weeks.\nU.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.\nIn a wider measure of dollar positioning <0#NETUSDFX=> that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position equivalent to $11.02 billion, down from $13.31 billion the previous week.\nThat was the lowest net short dollar positioning in four months.\nSince mid-April, the dollar has rallied by more than 5 percent, underpinned by rising U.S. Treasury yields and solid economic data that puts the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least two more times this year.\nHowever, Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities, believes the dollar’s rally should prove temporary, although he said for now there is further room for the greenback to extend its gains.\nBut he expects that once global economic trends become more stable and major foreign central banks start signalling they would adjust monetary policy later this year, the dollar should resume its downtrend.\nIn the cryptocurrency market, speculators’ net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures rose to 1,874 contracts <0#1CFTC1330E1> from 1,635 the previous week, the data showed.\nAfter a downtrend in the first few months of the year, bitcoin has stabilized between $8,000 and $9,000. It last traded at $8,229.91, up 2.2 percent on the day on the Bitstamp platform.\nFundstrat in a research note on Friday said the CME posted record volumes in the past week for bitcoin futures, which suggests institutional interest on the virtual currency is rising.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Matthew Lewis\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://twitter.com/ReutersIndia", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary market", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:06:00.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3043fa11fc7d3aa5088d4caab4bac26f925f945", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKeo6Qv4AGs5grNSYByH4w0He602siemlSYhSnPo4.QKQj39YeEXuIOqeVieHxl473az1GrYN3R6A-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.ca", "site": "freelancer.ca", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.ca/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Tor Expert - Website Building, Bitcoin Setup", "title_full": "Tor Expert - Website Building, Bitcoin Setup", "published": "2018-05-18T19:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3043fa11fc7d3aa5088d4caab4bac26f925f945", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKeo6Qv4AGs5grNSYByH4w0He602siemlSYhSnPo4.QKQj39YeEXuIOqeVieHxl473az1GrYN3R6A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T19:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tor Expert - Website Building, Bitcoin Setup", "text": "Bitcoin Secure VPS For Tor/Reverse Proxy For Anti DDOS\nLooking for Tor Expert or Some Cyber Security Professional to set up my server with socat for reverse proxy for ddos prevention.
