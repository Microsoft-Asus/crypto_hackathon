If you choose to pursue it, exchange it and don't keep it for long. ~ Dinar Chronicles\n‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz\nMAY 12, 2018 11:52\nInterested in earning Bitcoin (BTC)? Start earning today!\nBillionaire bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz , founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Capital Management, says every investor should have 1% to 2% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency. Not to do so, he told CNN , is “almost irresponsible.”\nCrypto To Disrupt Every Vertical\nOn Wednesday, Novogratz’s firm and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index , an index that tracks 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is important not on account of expected gains, Novogratz said, but because in two to four years blockchain technology, which allows companies to make and record near instant transactions, will be challenging every vertical.\nWhile the decentralized version of Uber may not be Uber, it will be a challenge and it constitutes a “real value proposition,” he said.\nNovogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner, said he has invested 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies.\nTraditional Institutions Testing The Waters\nThe owner of the New York Stock Exchange is reportedly considering launching a cryptocurrency exchange. | Source: Shutterstock\nMainstream financial institutions, meanwhile, are finding ways to allow traditional investors to benefit from bitcoin. Nasdaq in April signed an agreement with Gemini Trust, a cryptocurrency exchange.\nOne unknown, however, is how governments will regulate cryptocurrency.\nNovogratz predicted the New York Stock Exchange will be active in cryptocurrency trading in less than six months.\nNot everyone on Wall Street agrees with Novogratz. Warren Buffett, an investment icon, has been bearish on bitcoin, having most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway ’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\nNovogratz said the difference in opinion is age-related, with older players much more skeptical about cryptocurrency.\nGalaxy Digital Moves Forward\nGalaxy Digital , meanwhile, has announced plans to buy Canadian startup First Coin Capital and then merge with Bradmer Pharmaceuticals — which is publicly listed on the Toronto-based TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) — through a reverse takeover.\nFollowing the merger, Bradmer will be renamed to Galaxy Digital, allowing the company to trade publicly without having to undergo traditional financial disclosures associated with listing on an exchange.\nGalaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency merchant bank — which Novogratz reportedly hopes to make the “Goldman Sachs of Crypto” — will have a fourfold business model, according to public statements made by the firm.\nThe bank will open a cryptocurrency trading desk and initially seek to capitalize on opportunities for cross-exchange arbitrage. It will also invest in blockchain startups and ICOs, much as Novogratz intended to do through his now-shelved cryptocurrency hedge fund. Finally, it will provide advisory and asset management services to wealthy clients.\nSource: CCN ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T06:11:46.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "730aeec4ed2bdc53e91fc110069008547145c0c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma5NnryB6_X7vH2wPppxIyw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=84.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Service Announcements", "title": "[ANN] ✅ CLIXCO.IN ✅- Earn free Bitcoin every second ! - ✔ Instant Withdraw", "title_full": "[ANN] ✅ CLIXCO.IN ✅- Earn free Bitcoin every second ! - ✔ Instant Withdraw", "published": "2018-05-13T06:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.136, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "730aeec4ed2bdc53e91fc110069008547145c0c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma5NnryB6_X7vH2wPppxIyw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Haskuld", "published": "2018-05-13T06:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] ✅ CLIXCO.IN ✅- Earn free Bitcoin every second ! - ✔ Instant Withdraw", "text": "Username: Haskuld\nSurfed ads today: 31\nEarned today 170\nThx for bonus!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T03:58:31.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37adabed21fb350fc543bc9ddb01126a6e396758", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWaClff5pRlufYq1Ny7pZwM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can Blockchain Survive Without Bitcoin", "title_full": "Can Blockchain Survive Without Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T06:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37adabed21fb350fc543bc9ddb01126a6e396758", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWaClff5pRlufYq1Ny7pZwM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rickyNmorty", "published": "2018-05-13T06:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Blockchain Survive Without Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: KuyaBreezy on February 19, 2018, 04:49:10 AM\nBlockchain Technology was driven to fame by its application on Bitcoin Gold due to its encryption that has been considered hacker proof.

Phillips Vitalik Buterin is the programmer and writer primarily known as a co-founder of Ethereum and as a co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine.\nAre Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies considered securities?\nThis hot-button question keeps coming at me on social media and from clients in the Email so I’d like to present my opinion here in this open forum.\nThere are a few concurrent stories right now that hinge on this. There is a rising speculation that the SEC could start calling some cryptos securities and if they do that, it creates some rather sticky legal issues for the founders and holders.\nHere’s a post that explains why this is such an issue.\nAnd this is a big case that may be the decision maker from a legal standpoint in the US.\nAnyway, if the SEC does end up classing them as securities it could cause some extreme volatility in the crypto market, I mean, even more than usual.\nIf something is classified as a security then it has to be subject to the usual laws and regulations regarding traditional financial assets. Meaning, it needs to be registered with the authorities according to the laws already set in place and be taxable as such. Anyone who has made profits in crypto, and converted those profits into cash, could be liable to pay taxes on those profits.\nFor example, any new ETF like the one that the Winklevoss twins have just secured a patent for will be classified a security.\nCryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are a different ball of wax. We’re talking about a brand new asset class here and the coins themselves will likely require new sets of rules that are more versatile and designed to encompass this new technology.\nBecause we live in a moderately diversified world, the laws could end up being different in every country. The Swiss have actually set an excellent precedent in their ICO guidelines , which breaks down the crypto classification into three different categories: FINMA\nBitcoin would certainly fall under the first category as it is designed to be a means of payment and store of value.\nEthereum and Ripple’s XRP are classic examples of Utility Tokens. They were designed to interact with their respective blockchains in order to provide access/payment to an application or service within the network.\nAsset Tokens, or Securities, implies that the token holder will be entitled to partial ownership in the company or foundation. This can manifest itself as a share of the company’s profits or voting rights within the company.\nThough the Ethereum network often holds votes using ETH tokens, the act of holding the token itself does not give the hodler the right to influence the network’s actions. Ripple’s XRP is managed by a private company called Ripple Labs and XRP holders are not entitled to any piece of that company.\nThe original DAO tokens in 2016, for those of you who remember that experiment, were considered Securities as confirmed by the SEC .\nThis content is provided for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered to be investment advice or recommendation.\nThe outlook presented is a personal opinion of the analyst and does not represent an official position of eToro.\nPast performance is not an indication of future results. All trading involves risk; only risk capital you are prepared to lose.\nCryptocurrencies can widely fluctuate in prices and are not appropriate for all investors. Trading cryptocurrencies is not supervised by any EU regulatory framework.\nMati Greenspan is the Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a global social trading and investment platform.

For 15 years, Tara has been proactively studying and understanding the ocean to better preserve it from climate change. Its mission is essential but is often confronted with the difficulty of engaging the general public, politicians or the investors necessary to finance marine research. The environment represents less than 3% of donations to charities. The Tara Foundation team has therefore developed – with FF Los Angeles, a creative agency founded by Fred & Farid – a system called “Ocean Miner”: a new hydraulic turbine system, installed in the Gulf of Morbihan, in Brittany, France, where marine streams and tides are at their strongest. How it works\nThis turbine is naturally driven by stream action, converting the energy from the ocean into electrical energy. A computer operating in Mining, i.e. the generation of Bitcoins, has been wired to this unit. The generation of this crypto-money via mining is a computerized process for accounting trades in the public register of transactions (carried out with what is referred to as the Blockchain). In return, each registered operation generates a margin of Bitcoin for the owner of the computer. This digital currency is then convertible into Euros and can, therefore, immediately be re-invested in ocean research.\nThe computer and its components were set up in a small house equipped with mirrors, thus downplaying the visual impact of its implementation on the Brittany coast and also protecting them from the weather. After the house was locked and connected to the turbine, the system was autonomous and self-sufficient, using the power of the ocean to create its own energy. A system able to produce crypto-money\nAfter a month of running the turbine and generating Bitcoin, the “Ocean Miner” system made it possible for the Tara Foundation to collect nearly 0.0015414 BTC / day, or 200 € / month over the whole implementation phase.\n“This system certainly won’t cover the needs of the scientific research, it is only a drop in the ocean: a minimal symbolic contribution made to the expeditions led by Tara. It is, however, a powerful way of recalling that only the mobilization of everyone together will make it possible to fund the research to study, understand and to better protect the Ocean in the future,” explained Romain Troublé, Managing Director of the Tara Expeditions Foundation.\n“Over the years, FF has been actively involved with a series of creative social responsibility projects ranging from refugees to social advocacy, the environment, and beyond. Today, we’ve decided to focus our creativity on a place of huge importance that doesn’t get the attention it needs: our oceans. The 4 offices of the network are each creatively committed to this cause like FF New York and FF Shanghai with Sea Shepherd or FF Paris with Noé – and today FF Los Angeles with the Tara Foundation. We are eager to select one great cause, only one and to go deeper knowledge of the topic campaign by campaign.

Subverting SWIFT\nFounded by German Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond is an online bank which now affords its customers the ability to transfer loans internationally — specifically, by using Bitcoin.\nThe platform uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to subvert SWIFT — the self-proclaimed world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services — by lending money around the world instantly and at virtually no cost. Albrecht explained to Reuters TV :\nTraditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nWhat makes this service even more remarkable is the fact that Bitbond became an officially licensed bank in 2016. How it Works\nBitbond works by letting clients hold their loans in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for extremely short periods of time before they are exchanged back into the receiving countries’ native fiat currency. This method keeps exchange rates relatively fixed and prevents the cryptocurrency market’s infamous volatility from undermining the process.\nAs noted by Reuters , this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been used as loan collateral. However, Bitbond is reportedly the first to offer the transfer of credit in currency internationally. As such, the company has become increasingly popular since it originally launched in 2013 — currently managing 100 clients’ loans for a rough total of $1 million each month.\nThe majority of said clients, Albrecht told Reuters , are small business owners or freelance workers, while the loans are less than $50,000 each. Germany Loves Bitcoin\nAs a side note, Germans have been particularly keen on adopting Bitcoin. According to Bitnodes, Germany has the second most Bitcoin nodes in the world — behind only the U.S.\nHowever, authorities in the European country haven’t historically been too keen on cryptocurrency. In February, interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier signed a letter to fellow G20 finance ministers, in which he claimed cryptocurrencies are not only risky for investors but also threaten long-term global financial stability.\nNevertheless, Germany did join 21 of its European neighbors in signing a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership on April 10.\nWhat do you think about a certified online bank subverting SWIFT by sending loans internationally with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

The Bitcoin is approximately valued around $10 billion.\nXapo is a storage company that stores Bitcoin, through a combination of a cold storage vault and a bitcoin-based debit card. The company is based in Hong Kong. The vault has blast-proof doors and corridors of reinforced concrete, encrypted computer servers.\nThe major principle of owning Bitcoin is to keep the private key a secret, the code allows a customer to spend his/her coins. But due to advancements in modern technology, many thieves can now get a hold of the private key and use the cryptocurrency. Even if the keys are in cold storage, hackers often set traps on computers and get access to them the moment they are online. The critics have questioned the safe-keeping of the cryptocurrency.\nXapo’s solution is to bury the cold storage device inside of a mountain and put it in a safe, highly secured vault, with a layer of electronic safeguards. The company stated that it would initially verify the client’s information and confirm his/her request. The retrieving of the Bitcoin from the vault will take around 2 days. The company will then manually sign the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations.\nThe company has vaults in 5 continents. The company is also known for converting a decommissioned Swiss army bunker to a Bitcoin storage facility. The vault has $10 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company also offers customers a trading platform to buy and sell Bitcoin and has created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend.\nLight a Reddit user says:\n“This is awesome. A custodian option(s) are what is needed for Institutions to get involved in crypto.”\nRogers a Twitter user says:\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys, It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T08:19:46.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5cfa77f88201298f9eee966a718b255cf90ea59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSzE5hgqxwJAOHQxBfd91CU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "Which one to choose BITCOIN or ALTCOIN ??", "title_full": "Which one to choose BITCOIN or ALTCOIN ??", "published": "2018-05-13T05:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5cfa77f88201298f9eee966a718b255cf90ea59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSzE5hgqxwJAOHQxBfd91CU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kul0n", "published": "2018-05-13T05:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Which one to choose BITCOIN or ALTCOIN ??", "text": "I think it's better to divide the deposit and invest 35-40% in bitcoin and 60-65% in altcoins which are in the top 30 on the CMC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T07:37:51.060+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de39c9560ff1efcb4047ddd908f5c3d068551844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma9lgkzJmf4ps4ibQx3SfRg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=212.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Micro Earnings", "title": "Bitcoin - Earn Money Talk Faucet", "title_full": "Bitcoin - Earn Money Talk Faucet", "published": "2018-05-13T05:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de39c9560ff1efcb4047ddd908f5c3d068551844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma9lgkzJmf4ps4ibQx3SfRg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "looser101983", "published": "2018-05-13T05:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin - Earn Money Talk Faucet", "text": "Quote: from: earnmoneytalk on May 12, 2018, 11:50:54 AM We have introduced two new things maybe most of you are aware of the first one\n1.

Eiland Glover, CEO of Kowala agrees.\n“Running a large, centralized, unregulated crypto exchange with thousands of daily transactions and billions in daily trade volume of volatile assets presents its principals with many opportunities to skim off the top. You could easily front run transactions, manipulate pricing data, misreport the crypto funds in customer wallets—the list is endless.\nA little number times a big number is a big number. If you could skim only 2 basis points per transaction, for example, you could purloin $100m for yourself on half a trillion in annual trading volume.” That’s why government regulation isn’t a bad thing for cryptocurrency markets.\n“I don’t see this as a black and white situation for further crackdown but more for a reason that authorities regulate these exchanges in an ongoing way so that fraud is minimized,” adds Goldmann. “That means the more properly and mindfully the space in general but certainly in Korea is regulated the better and healthier it is for the whole ecosystem.\nSo, generally I don’t see that as a negative thing.” 7d Performance of Major Cryptocurrencies Source: Coinmarketcap.com 5/11/18 at 2.50 p.m. Read more from forbes.com…\n forbes.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/05/12/is-koreas-big-government-trying-to-destroy-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "goldm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiland glover", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kowala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T05:25:08.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f65f3765af78c794363f0684cca458722296536b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YkgGBC3B8pGMQSuli1ZhDSg8w7wLSZiq8IPHjA.sp6J.Wv.gtXmejU6k-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Test Net : btc", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Test Net : btc", "published": "2018-05-13T05:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.19, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f65f3765af78c794363f0684cca458722296536b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YkgGBC3B8pGMQSuli1ZhDSg8w7wLSZiq8IPHjA.sp6J.Wv.gtXmejU6k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "in__the__red", "published": "2018-05-13T05:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Test Net : btc", "text": "Where do I go to find info about the BCH test nets?\n submitted by /u/in__the__red\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T00:09:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57fc2d67db177b7f306ba1183319a9a67cee3d78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Ykr6Dk0bSv2rX9M3jam.CCRAAqGZ59Hx7aS9p5bhheqSxuX1hzgFJjx1e2_k.mgT2S2LAp6iwKcBf3mZiOfp6pRM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Bitcoin is killing the planet: Fact or Fiction?

Bitcoin Roulette Strategies for French Wheels\nBeyond Martingale and Fibonacci, the rest of the known strategies for Bitcoin roulette are based on the French wheel. The four strategies are explained below. Jeu Zero – French for “zero game”. Players recurring to this strategy will place 4 chips as follows: on zero, the 4 numbers to the left of zero on the wheel and the two numbers to the right of zero on the wheel. This means placing chips on the following places on the table: one between 32 and 35, a chip on 26, a chip between 12 and 15 and a chip between 0 and 3. Voisins Du Zero – The “neighbors of zero” strategy. This one is close to the previous one. Players who deploy it will place bets on numbers neighboring zero. Those 7 chips will be placed between the 0, 3 and 2 on the table, 4 and 7, 12 and 15, 18 and 21, 19 and 22, 25 26 28 and 29, 32 and 35. Tiers Du Cylindre – This strategy consists of splitting the wheel in three and playing on “thirds of the wheel”. This strategy is the opposite of the one above. Deploying this strategy requires placing 7 chips at least, each on the following places on the table: 5 and 8, 11 and 10, 13 and 16, 23 and 24, 27 and 30, and 33 and 36. Les Orphelins – Simply put, the “orphans” strategy. It relies on covering all the numbers not covered by the previous strategy. Deploying the orphans requires players to place at least one chip on the following places on the table: the number 1, between 6 and 9, between 14 and 17, another between 17 and 20, and one between 31 and 34.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2GYokfZ", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "voisins du zero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "du cylindre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "martingale", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T19:37:41.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "198855da985bdcaef16c7c9c19b5d53eed50aade", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQPyoHmzdGItV4HdrVQsQIc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=197.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Service Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] ★★ PrivCoin.io Mixing service for Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash ★★", "title_full": "[ANN] ★★ PrivCoin.io Mixing service for Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash ★★", "published": "2018-05-13T04:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.156, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "198855da985bdcaef16c7c9c19b5d53eed50aade", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQPyoHmzdGItV4HdrVQsQIc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PrivCoin", "published": "2018-05-13T04:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] ★★ PrivCoin.io Mixing service for Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash ★★", "text": "If anyone has more ETH they want to invest, check us out!

If you look at your past questions, you have gotten a number of answers on them by moderators that you're suspecting here. Unless you have some sort of indication why one of us three would have been the one to downvote here (and it wasn't me), it seems to me that you're being unfair here. While it is preferable when people leave a comment why they voted, nobody is obligated to do that. — However, if I were to hazard a guess, the question asked here reads more like a statement and it's not clear what you're asking. – Murch ♦ 1 hour ago Thanks Murch. Appreciate your comment. This gets subjective when someone feels that question should be asked only in a particular way. My question is clear and that is - It is claimed that BTC mining is decentralised, which is theoretical but in reality it is not as only few mining companies are growing bigger and stronger essentially centralizing the power again. It has moved from banks to few miners essentially which I find dangerous. I need expert's take on this. Let me know if that makes sense to you. – user2203937 9 mins ago", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T05:06:31.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f62b7232b5c4a43995ed1a763436a56e36f8d5c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_uBcn5s23N.Pb_WkQYOxiNaw0Guf8Rsb_qcPDIzdTJVTvwvYeaYtjubSMg_6WagSUGCURYg1F4wuvxPQYALxzRRehweFgPlJX9IrdJ8N1BKcpxMDeFIaGZ66EteRrPBcmET8w1_hTWk2zqGpo.Qe58", "site_full": "www.phoneforums.org", "site": "phoneforums.org", "site_section": "http://www.phoneforums.org/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Mobile Phone Forums", "title": "Huawei brings Chinese People Closer to Bitcoin via their Mobile ... - ZyCrypto", "title_full": "Huawei brings Chinese People Closer to Bitcoin via their Mobile ... - ZyCrypto", "published": "2018-05-13T04:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f62b7232b5c4a43995ed1a763436a56e36f8d5c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_uBcn5s23N.Pb_WkQYOxiNaw0Guf8Rsb_qcPDIzdTJVTvwvYeaYtjubSMg_6WagSUGCURYg1F4wuvxPQYALxzRRehweFgPlJX9IrdJ8N1BKcpxMDeFIaGZ66EteRrPBcmET8w1_hTWk2zqGpo.Qe58", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "News", "published": "2018-05-13T04:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei brings Chinese People Closer to Bitcoin via their Mobile ... - ZyCrypto", "text": "ZyCrypto\nHuawei brings Chinese People Closer to Bitcoin via their Mobile ...\nZyCrypto\nQuite in contrary to the recent actions or rather inactions of the Google Play Store and some of Apple's iTunes store, Huawei is all set to release BTC.com's ...\nHuawei to make it easier for Chinese people to use bitcoin on their mobile phones South China Morning Post\nHuawei Pre-Installing Bitcoin Wallets on Phones.

Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm. Designerkottayam / Pixabay\nNext week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way. click to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks. click to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies.\nSpeaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further.\nG20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy—the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue.\nAlong those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls—or going completely cashless—could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere.\nWhere do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust—or distrust, I should say—and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services.\nWhat’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet—no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I’m very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

When SegWit was soft-forked into both protocols, the capacity increased to a hypothetical 4 MB blockweight limit.\nBut the limit doesn't mean every block that's produced is 1 MB. All it means is that it can not exceed 1 MB. What determines the size of the block is the size of the transactions in the block.\nLet's say, the data size of a \"one in\" and \"one out\" transaction is about 200 bytes. Now let's pretend, there are 100 transactions like this that are included in a single block. That means the total size of this block would be about 2 kB.

ALL OF MY FUNDS AND MY ID HAVE BEEN STOLEN.\nFirst, please do not post comments that I should not have used Freewallet. I think that's pretty obvious now. It was a huge mistake but that doesn't make what they're doing any less criminal.\nI suffer from cancer, which Ive told them already, but the Freewallet scam keeps on rolling. NO honest company has the HUNDREDS of scam complaints that these thieves at [ u/freewallet _support ] 1 do. Look up their previous posts to me.\nFor no valid reason, Freewallet began blocking customer access to their funds recently. Every ridiculous, phony excuse has been made, none of them true.\nAfter absolutely assuring I would have access to my crypto after a simple ID submission, Freewallet instead obstructed my access by making an absurd claim that my ID photos had been edited. That is exactly the tactic I expected from this criminal organization. As I proved to them via video, all of my photos were 100% legitimate, completely unedited. On top of that, EVERY other crypto exchange that Ive submitted my ID to has NEVER even questioned it. WHY? Because the other exchanges are not scams like [ u/freewallet _support ] 1 is. Again, just look at the massive number of complaints. Search them. It speaks for itself.\nTheir tactic is beyond predictable for a scam. When they see they've encountered their worst nightmare, meaning me in this case, they begin resolving a few complaints here and there to make it look like they're trying to do right. All of those, however, are peanuts compared to my life savings. They would rather risk their necks than let that go back to its rightful owner. That's what lowlife scammers like Freewallet do.\nTheyre so careless at Freewallet, that they never thought to consider Reddit posts CANNOT be deleted. This is NOT Facebook, where they delete customer complaints ALL the time.\nNothing matters to them but stealing my life savings. I have my life savings in there. I have given them EXACTLY what they asked for, and I still have NO access to my crypto.\nMy emails to them are now also with the US Attorney, who is the most prolific cyber crimes prosecutor on earth. They have already stated to my personal lawyer that a company who refuses to provide their own identities and location cannot lawfully ask customers for theirs. The USA's office labeled Freewallet \"an obvious scam\" in a call with my lawyer. Im a US customer, so Freewallet must abide by US law. The US has extradited many cyber criminals who have never even set foot in the US before, just because they stole from a US customer. They have that kind of extreme influence worldwide.\nAt this point my cancer symptoms have grown worse due to the stress Freewallet has caused me. I can barely breathe at times. However, I certainly expect to be here long enough to have them prosecuted, via the US Attorney, and their partner, Interpol.\nPerhaps their biggest problem though, is I now know who their biggest figure is, whose operation is funded by stolen Freewallet funds like mine, and until my crypto is released to me, he can expect his life to be a nightmare.\nYou stole from the wrong cancer patient Freewallet... and now you're going to pay\n'''\nFreewallet stole cancer patient's life savings & ID\nGo1dfish undelete link\nunreddit undelete link\nAuthor: /u/mxgmxg\n1: https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/\n2: https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/\n submitted by /u/removalbot\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://unreddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iykkp", "http://r.go1dfish.me/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iykkp"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T03:46:43.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2e21ac173b08e939394c1f514b32f5faf59537e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapShdUoUEKUybEC6fIuYS3GOWUALXUv_RHWSz8Tk5.DolkPzzaggJzTyrDDFjF3bi.u4_huDtXrqN.zRUjIctregkGYHFqZdOPdIhHmnK8C.E0zx0ZZlNGZ9Q--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : reddit.com", "title": "05-13 00:33 - 'I said I wouldn't fuel the fire... but I couldn't help myself.. :/' (i.redd.it) by /u/Cburns6976 removed from /r/Bitcoin within 70-80min : removalbot", "title_full": "05-13 00:33 - 'I said I wouldn't fuel the fire... but I couldn't help myself.. :/' (i.redd.it) by /u/Cburns6976 removed from /r/Bitcoin within 70-80min : removalbot", "published": "2018-05-13T03:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.047, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2e21ac173b08e939394c1f514b32f5faf59537e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapShdUoUEKUybEC6fIuYS3GOWUALXUv_RHWSz8Tk5.DolkPzzaggJzTyrDDFjF3bi.u4_huDtXrqN.zRUjIctregkGYHFqZdOPdIhHmnK8C.E0zx0ZZlNGZ9Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "removalbot", "published": "2018-05-13T03:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "05-13 00:33 - 'I said I wouldn't fuel the fire... but I couldn't help myself.. :/' (i.redd.it) by /u/Cburns6976 removed from /r/Bitcoin within 70-80min : removalbot", "text": "I said I wouldn't fuel the fire... but I couldn't help myself.. :/\nGo1dfish undelete link\nunreddit undelete link\nAuthor: /u/Cburns6976\n submitted by /u/removalbot\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://unreddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8izqeb", "http://r.go1dfish.me/r/Bitcoin/comments/8izqeb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T03:35:25.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "956fb243084a55a5e61c4637939d53a8c0794d1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgN.Ix37ROcyFsnyVy6t6KPSTJn9Py9kPgulTSNFPp9Tzx1VOHFBrK8XvT6bt9gpJAZSpj6jro0MaLkZ9Wzzpbav2gAKVmk5D8qrKI5NpKETWC31toZLzCWQ--", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Is Korea’s Big Government Trying To Destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Ripple?", "title_full": "Is Korea’s Big Government Trying To Destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Ripple?", "published": "2018-05-13T03:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "956fb243084a55a5e61c4637939d53a8c0794d1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgN.Ix37ROcyFsnyVy6t6KPSTJn9Py9kPgulTSNFPp9Tzx1VOHFBrK8XvT6bt9gpJAZSpj6jro0MaLkZ9Wzzpbav2gAKVmk5D8qrKI5NpKETWC31toZLzCWQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-13T03:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Korea’s Big Government Trying To Destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Ripple?", "text": "Is Korea’s Big Government Trying To Destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Ripple?

The higher the price the less likely it would be manipulated.\nOr the distribution of supply of bitcoin? More people holding bitcoin, the harder for the whale to move the price.\nWhat do you think?\nThe basic economic law of supply and demand. When there's so much demand for bitcoin in the market, the price shoots up and then vice versa. That's one major factor why the price is so volatile that it can change in a matter of minutes. Another factor I can see that is the news, positive and negative news drove the price to go down and up. However, if you look at the bright side, volatility has its advantage as well specially for daily traders. Most of them takes advantages of the wild price swings and uses their TA go look for opportunities. Price volatility can cause irritation to most of us, but if you look at the positive of it, anyone of us can take advantage and make a lot of profits.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T23:03:14.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e14d9e581d9a85e57e0e2b63847af2c7de4ab352", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArenS3r0s9WxM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown -

Subverting SWIFT\nFounded by German Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond is an online bank which now affords its customers the ability to transfer loans internationally — specifically, by using Bitcoin.\nThe platform uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to subvert SWIFT — the self-proclaimed world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services — by lending money around the world instantly and at virtually no cost. Albrecht explained to Reuters TV :\nTraditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nWhat makes this service even more remarkable is the fact that Bitbond became an officially licensed bank in 2016. How it Works\nBitbond works by letting clients hold their loans in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for extremely short periods of time before they are exchanged back into the receiving countries’ native fiat currency. This method keeps exchange rates relatively fixed and prevents the cryptocurrency market’s infamous volatility from undermining the process.\nAs noted by Reuters , this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been used as loan collateral. However, Bitbond is reportedly the first to offer the transfer of credit in currency internationally. As such, the company has become increasingly popular since it originally launched in 2013 — currently managing 100 clients’ loans for a rough total of $ 1 million each month.\nThe majority of said clients, Albrecht told Reuters , are small business owners or freelance workers, while the loans are less than $ 50,000 each. Germany Loves Bitcoin\nAs a side note, Germans have been particularly keen on adopting Bitcoin. According to Bitnodes, Germany has the second most Bitcoin nodes in the world — behind only the U.S.\nHowever, authorities in the European country haven’t historically been too keen on cryptocurrency. In February, interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier signed a letter to fellow G20 finance ministers, in which he claimed cryptocurrencies are not only risky for investors but also threaten long-term global financial stability.\nNevertheless, Germany did join 21 of its European neighbors in signing a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership on April 10.\nWhat do you think about a certified online bank subverting SWIFT by sending loans internationally with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

The negative trend was probably determined by some notable developments in Asia, powerful enough to influence the mood of traders. Just as Bitcoin (BTC) looked poised to storm the $10,000 psychological threshold, the ghost of notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reminded bitcoiners it isn’t done with them yet. Tokyo-based court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, Nobuaki Kobayashi, seems ready to flood the market, again. According to Blockchain.info, over 8,000 coins from two court ordered cold storage wallets have been recently shifted. As soon as the news broke, BTC prices plummeted.\nSouth Korean media reported that the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation on suspicions of fraud. The exchange confirmed the news in a statement and tried to reassure its customers that their assets are kept securely, while “all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.” Reports suggested that Upbit is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account. Acting on that information, Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the company, securing computer hard disks and accounting records. Upbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto trading platform. China to Publish Monthly Crypto Report\n decided to keep a close eye on decentralized currencies, despite all crypto bans it has imposed so far. Beijing authorities are set to publish a regular monthly analysis of over two dozen crypto assets in the form of the new Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide,” according to a government press release. Almost 30 cryptos will be analyzed. The coins included in the index are expected to conform to certain standards like having an independent main chain and an open block browser.\nChina is also working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic. Initially the blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards, but the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future. Localbitcoins Changes ToS to Comply With EU Law\nThe popular peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has updated its Terms of Service (ToS), noting that the changes have been introduced mainly due to regulations in the European Union. The new ToS of the Helsinki-based trading platform highlight certain identification requirements. In some situations users will be required to submit a copy of ID, although identity verification is not yet implemented as a mandatory procedure for all traders. The company has detailed some of the situations in which identification will be necessary. These include trading over certain volume limits, cases of account hacking/recovery, and fraud investigations. The new terms will be enforced on May 25. Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nThis week we also covered some interesting developments in our daily rubric “Bitcoin in Brief”. After introducing a ban on crypto-related ads earlier this year, social media giant Facebook is now considering creating its own cryptocurrency to facilitate on-platform payments, reports suggested. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the network is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies. The company announced recently it had formed a team tasked to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that can be utilized to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase. BCH-Powered Social Media Apps Launch New Features\nTwo popular Bitcoin Cash social media applications, Memo and Blockpress, have introduced new features on their platforms this week. Users can now upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay. Memo has recently added a bunch of features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. Its programmers also added a ‘Topics’ section where people can discuss any topic trending on the application. On Thursday, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support. Users can now upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction.\nLast week, another BCH-powered social media application was launched – Blockpress. Just like Memo, the platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Its developer “Attila” said that after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will provide the ability to upload much longer content. Currently, its users can add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics, and a sidebar of followed profiles on Blockpress. Bitcoin and the Carnal Temptations\nA bitcoin supporter hopes to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid a sex scandal. Four women have recently complained about non-consensual physical violence by Schneiderman. Stock market lawyer and former stand-up comedian Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is described as bitcoin enthusiast and a crypto investor, who advises several blockchain startups. Alicandro’s campaign will highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin in the Empire State and may accept donations in bitcoin. He has been quoted as saying that he would like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses. Alicandro believes that New York’s Bitlicense regime is hurting jobs and stifling innovation.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned just hours after the news about the violent sex scandal broke. His administration was behind an investigation into the operations of bitcoin exchanges which was rebuked by representatives of the crypto industry like Kraken CEO Jessie Powell who sharply criticized the regulatory overreach of his office.\nThis week bitcoin and carnal pleasures were mentioned together more than once. Exotic dancer Brenna Sparks, featured in the article about a Las Vegas club where strippers accept bitcoin via QR tattoos, has published a blog post on an adult entertainment industry portal explaining the advantages of cryptocurrency to her colleagues.

It’s been a very long time since Satoshi left the community and his vision, the white paper, and even the protocol’s proof-of-work has been questioned multiple times over the years.\nAlso read: Privacy-Centric Coin XMR Splits Into Four Different Monero Protocols BCH Proponents Believe That Many Key Attributes Have Been Slowly Replaced With a Whole New Concept\nSatoshi Nakamoto left the community in 2010, and no one has heard from the anonymous creator of bitcoin ever since. At the moment the bitcoin community has split into two factions due to the scaling debate, that coincidently started the same year Satoshi left. Many bitcoin cash supporters believe the BTC side of the community has never had a valid excuse against raising the 1 MB block size by utilizing a refuse to give in at-any-cost mentality . The bitcoin cash community believes this group has been so stubborn that Core supporters basically enabled blowback to occur this past August, allowing a large majority of users to go their separate ways by forking the protocol, before the introduction of the contentious Segregated Witness (Segwit). The protocol Segwit had been and still is controversial and hasn’t gained much traction even to this day. All of these individuals who once shared similar visions with their peers, formed another community and rallied around the bitcoin cash (BCH) network believing that BCH is the closest chain to Satoshi’s original vision. A slide from Dr. Peter Rizun’s speech at the Future of Bitcoin conference shows just one reason why people find Segregated Witness unfavorable. Revisionism\nAlongside all of this vitriolic energy tethered to the scaling debate, BCH supporters say there have been quite a few individuals who believe “Satoshi’s vision doesn’t matter , ” and actually have the audacity to propose making changes to the creator’s white paper. Many individuals will tell you the reason for this is because supporters of the Segwit chain have realized that the document does not apply to the BTC network. Unfortunately, BTC hardly resembles what is described in Satoshi’s white paper. For instance, the co-owners of Bitcoin.org, ‘Theymos,’ and ‘Cobra Bitcoin’ among others have talked about changing certain phrases in Satoshi’s paper . Another example is how the web portal Bitcoin.org, which is heralded by Core supporters as ‘truth,’ removed the cheap and fast transactions description for bitcoin off the front page — the reason for this is because the description does not apply to Core network. The owners of Bitcoin.org have discussed editing and revising the white paper on multiple occasions.\nOf course, bitcoin cash supporters have been livid about this method of revisionism used by the other side of this debate. It is often said that “Satoshi’s vision” or the creator himself doesn’t matter, but BCH supporters believe most free-thinking individuals understand that history is important. Satoshi’s words and his original white paper is extremely vital towards keeping the network from being perverted. Anyone who denies history doesn’t understand how things came to be, and they will have a serious issue coping with the future. The past is the future’s direct causation. The very title of the white paper explains that bitcoin is a “ peer-to-peer electronic cash system ” which shows absolutely no references to holding the coin as a speculative asset, or any comparison that represents a ‘digital store of value.’ Bitcoin.org removes certain descriptions from the front page. The front page has been replaced again with the 2010 definitions and the website’s co-owner Cobra thinks it is a good idea to remove them when necessary. Can’t Afford to Send Bitcoin? — Deal With It — It’s ‘Censorship Resistant’ for a Certain Group of Individuals\nAfter close to a decade, one by one, BCH supporters state that specific features that used to be promoted widely among the bitcoin community have been slowly forgotten. In the early days, bitcoin was considered pseudonymous and needed tools like mixers and tumblers that could help provide anonymity. However, due to the rise in transaction costs most bitcoin mixers and tumblers found the network unsustainable, and many were unable to mix coins because network fees were both too expensive and unreliable. Further, during the times when BTC suffered from extreme network congestion, and unconfirmed transactions spiked to well over 200,000, darknet mixers and tumblers were called out for ‘ spamming the network .’ There’s no one that can really argue that this meme is irrelevant.\nRemember when transactions were once described as cheaper than most centralized processors like Western Union? In the early days, people envisioned billions of micropayments helping people in need and third world countries. Instead throughout 2015- 2017, Core advocates and developers stated they didn’t mind if fees aggregated to $100 per transaction. Core developer Gregory Maxwell stated during the worst period of BTC’s transaction backlog and $60 fees that he was popping bottles of champagne. \"Personally, I'm pulling out the champagne that market behaviour is indeed producing activity levels that can pay for security without inflation, and also producing fee paying backlogs needed to stabilize consensus progress as the subsidy declines.\" ~ Greg Maxwell Dec. 21, 2017\nIt didn’t matter that economically unfortunate countries couldn’t afford to use the bitcoin blockchain as long as the chain continued to remain ‘censorship resistant’ — Ironically this thought process leads to the censorship of more than 2/3rds of this world who have a hard time considering paying $0.25 cents per transaction (tx) let alone $30-60 USD per tx. It’s safe to say that enjoying the rising fee market process is straight out of a Ponzi scheme manual where only the early adopters are those who can afford to use the network benefits. The Resurrection of Killer Apps\nCore supporters will tell you that bitcoin cash proponents are deceptive by utilizing the open brand name ‘bitcoin,’ when in fact all BCH proponents believe they are doing is “adhering to Satoshi’s original vision.” In fact, the chain and the BCH community are direct derivatives of stubborn blowback. Revisionists and actors with confirmation bias have clung to arguments that make no sense and act like the world is ready to adopt a whole new infrastructure called the ‘Lightning Network.’ This is after realizing on-chain BTC transactions are not very fast, and on-chain BTC transaction fees are unreliable especially during times of demand. Unfortunately, mainstream attention that took place during Q4 of 2017, was one of the worst periods of time for congestion, as BTC fees aggregated to upwards of $60 per transaction and confirmation times of up to a week for low fees. Then the mainstream was directed to a system that is not even close to widespread adoption , even though this mainstream audience was basically at a tipping point towards mass adoption. On April 4, a report was published that detailed major flaws and topology concerns with the Lightning Network. The author of this study was neither a bitcoin cash or bitcoin core holder.\nFortunately for mainstream adopters, BCH supporters believe bitcoin cash will be there to provide the very things that were promised in the early days that made the idea of cryptocurrencies so cool — actual fast, cheap, and reliable transactions that cannot be censored.\nThis is because BCH supporters state that mainstream audiences and users from third world countries won’t be hindered from using the cryptocurrency due to unreliable transfer times and tumultuous network fees. They also won’t have to learn to adopt a new network on top of the blockchain or learn about the flaws of routing, watchtowers, centralized hubs, opening channels, or keeping coins online in limbo. No, all they will have to learn is how to use bitcoin as it was taught for the past nine years. Mainstream audiences are also getting a glimpse of an ‘application resurrection’ of tools that were once heralded by the BTC community. The bitcoin cash ecosystem has resurrected mixers and tumblers , micro-tipping applications , a Bittorrent platform , social media apps like Memo and Blockpress , even the ability to send very small fractions of BCH without an internet connection . Protecting Propaganda and Censorship Over Conscience and Principles\nBitcoin cash proponents think that revisionists will continue to try and say that Satoshi and the white paper “doesn’t matter” and will attempt to revise history to make bitcoin something that it is not. Why do BCH enthusiasts believe this? Likely it is because supporters of bitcoin revisionism have defended propaganda and censorship, so much that it has become a routine activity on some of bitcoin’s most frequented forums. All of this for a stubborn win-at-any-cost mentality that wouldn’t even allow the discussion or open debate of adding one measly megabyte to the block size. No, BCH proponents believe the confusion Core supporters complain about, rests on their conscience, because they obfuscated the protocol’s original intentions, anonymous minions sniffed out dissenting opinions, and cried when they got the blowback (the birth of BCH) they deserved.\nIt’s safe to say that Satoshi’s vision will be remembered, and his white paper will remain safe from changes . However, BCH supporters understand that the revisionists will also be recognized for being intellectually dishonest and as sophists attempting to keep bitcoin hostage. Bitcoin cash enthusiasts believe that after August 1, 2017 bitcoin’s hostile takeover has ended, and there is now an avenue available to continue following Satoshi’s vision.\nWhat do you think about the idea that most BCH supporters believe that Core proponents have revised history and have tried to lessen Satoshi’s vision and even alter the white paper?

The bitcoin startup has seen its popularity grow, with the startup managing around $1 million in loans per month for 100 clients.\nThe revelation was made in an interview by Reuters TV with Bitbond’s German founder Radoslav Albrecht. He said the rationale behind the move is that it will help reduce the foreign exchange cost for clients. Using Bitcoin to Cut Costs\nBitbond is a peer to peer lending platform that aims to cater to the financially deprived by providing small business loans. The platform works similarly to most peer to peer bitcoin lending services where capital is lent to a business for commercial purposes without either party knowing the identity of each other.\nIt’s now clear that the lending platform will use the cryptocurrency to enable faster and easier transfer of online payments. A transaction via the conventional banking system can take a few working days to settle, whereas the process is done in real time with bitcoin .\nBitbond founder Radoslav Albrecht said, “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBitcoin is used by Bitbond as an alternative to SWIFT. Image: Pixabay\nBitbond will convert all fiat currency to bitcoin and then transfer it back into the equivalent fiat currency of the lender. This will help Bitbond to cut down on forex exchange costs, which under normal circumstances, would be passed on to the end user. Bitcoin will not be stored locally by Bitbond but transferred immediately back to fiat. Bitbond and the Era of Modern Lending\nWhile working on banking projects as a consultant in the early days of his career, Albrecht was fascinated by the idea of peer to peer lending and how it would revolutionize retail lending. He saw that there was a huge opportunity in the fintech space as banks were not able to cater to every customer demand and decided that he would turn into an entrepreneur in the fintech space.\nBut the breakout moment came in 2012 when he first heard of bitcoin and blockchain from a friend. He researched on the topic and concluded that he could use blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer lending platform.\nIn early 2013, Albrecht launched Bitbond. Speaking about his vision for the company, he said, “Our mission is to make borrowing and lending globally accessible. Many markets and regions are underserved by banks. In emerging markets, bank account penetration tends to be below 50 percent. Without a bank account, most people are excluded from formal financial services and can neither get an affordable loan nor invest their money for interest.”\nIn February 2017, BTCManager reported that the bitcoin startup had raised $1.2 million in funding from German and Turkish investors. Finance Industry Turn Toward the Blockchain\nOther banks and financial institutes are also warming up to exploring the possible applications of blockchain to simplify their daily business. Banks aim to use the technology to settle trades in real time as well as transferring funds instantly.\nGlobal technology consulting giant Accenture estimated that the top eight banks could almost save up to $8 billion by integrating blockchain technology to their business.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rahul nambiampurath global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:40:37.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d28fbc69006b0e24ef5103be6c58c226bc5a1f28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK8cHrpJn8tEqSI890wMR8rqSJXW_PUKrmLXBSXY6TGzDCMfdmAIPx8jquYqG3BdnD54ZZZ5QKEna5k_r7X_Nq5AwVDJZkHaxEcTdigoSisr3YoNR5yPCvOsGovONjvCm1nb_2j4CsIA--", "site_full": "walletinvestor.com", "site": "walletinvestor.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin $8650.060 - CryptoCurrency Trading Report - 13.05.2018 16:46 - CryptoCurrency Blog", "title_full": "Bitcoin $8650.060 - CryptoCurrency Trading Report - 13.05.2018 16:46 - CryptoCurrency Blog", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "https://walletinvestor.com/static/frontend/images/cryptocurrency-news-icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d28fbc69006b0e24ef5103be6c58c226bc5a1f28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK8cHrpJn8tEqSI890wMR8rqSJXW_PUKrmLXBSXY6TGzDCMfdmAIPx8jquYqG3BdnD54ZZZ5QKEna5k_r7X_Nq5AwVDJZkHaxEcTdigoSisr3YoNR5yPCvOsGovONjvCm1nb_2j4CsIA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin $8650.060 - CryptoCurrency Trading Report - 13.05.2018 16:46 - CryptoCurrency Blog", "text": "Bitcoin $8650.060 – CryptoCurrency Trading Report – 13.05.2018 16:46 Posted by CryptoCurrency on\nHot news:\nWhat’s happened in the last hour?\nAs of one hour range Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency in the trading market, a rise of 0.69 % on its value from 8590.784 dollars to 8650.060 dollars was recorded.

Can this young upstart money challenge the global monetary order? Economist Saifedean Ammous traces the history of the technologies of money to seashells, limestones, cattle, salt, beads, metals, and government debt, explaining what gave these technologies their monetary role, what makes for sound money, and the benefits of a sound monetary regime to economic growth, innovation, culture, trade, individual freedom, and international peace.\nThe monetary and historical analysis sets the stage for understanding the mechanics of the operation of Bitcoin, the reasons for its initial success, and the role it could play in an information economy. Rather than serving as a currency and network for consumer purchases, the author argues Bitcoin is better suited as a store of value and network for settlement between large financial institutions. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin's true importance may just lie in providing a decentralized, neutral, free-market alternative to national central banks.\nAZW3\nCode: https://rg.to/file/9933bc72ede8ea9a0...3861.azw3.html\nEPUB\nCode: https://rg.to/file/2661d294e1c40d004...3861.epub.html\nPDF\nCode: https://rg.to/file/9b739dd8d42ffa92e...ndard.pdf.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://rg.to/file/9933bc72ede8ea9a0fcf08b047b9624a/1119473861.azw3.html", "https://rg.to/file/2661d294e1c40d004f66c290ab4a1312/1119473861.epub.html", "https://rg.to/file/9b739dd8d42ffa92ef9840102cd43c54/The_Bitcoin_Standard.pdf.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:36:32.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a628b21c795d7995191877c93957dafecd69ea89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8NidjPJVCwX9J9S7ufTBu4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a628b21c795d7995191877c93957dafecd69ea89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8NidjPJVCwX9J9S7ufTBu4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvest your time and effort inviting new users and you will guarantee a high passive income for yourself for a long time.

For Bitbond , an online German bank founded by Radoslav Albrecht, that future seems to be getting closer and closer as they have been able to function successfully and normally by using bitcoin for international payments rather than requiring the services of omnipresent SWIFT. SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications . It is a messaging platform used by financial institutions to transmit information regarding monetary transactions and operations using a standard coding system. The robustness of the system combined with constant updates has made it possible for SWIFT to consolidate itself as the number one choice for interbank payment processing. However, for bureaucratic reasons inherent in the banking system, some transactions may take hours or even days to be completed.\nA simplified graph of an international bank transfer using SWIFT. Credit CBInsights\nTo solve this problem, Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies to avoid the long waiting times that would exist through traditional systems. Similarly, the high fees that have to be paid due to a large number of intermediaries that may be involved in a SWIFT transaction could be overcome by the small – or nil – fees that are charged when using cryptocurrency. In an interview for Reuters TV , Albrecht mentioned the apparent advantages for a bank of using blockchain over traditional systems such as SWIFT: Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees and can take up to a few days… With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nBlockchain: A Powerful Tool for Traditional Banks In order to circumvent the problems associated with the fluctuation in the value of cryptos, the clients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of their country avoiding the crypto’s exchange rates, having the confidence that the amount in FIAT will be the same even though the means of transfer have a fluctuating value. The service has grown over time, managing a portfolio of over $1 million per month in loans for a clientele of mostly small business owners and freelance workers. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank leading to an important increase on the number of clients. Bitcoin has been growing in popularity in the country. Right now , Germany has the most substantial number of Bitcoin nodes in the world (1939) after the United States (2538). This fact allows envisioning a near future in which the adoption of cryptocurrencies becomes a reality. And it is more likely that this future will be fulfilled in Germany than in any other country on the European continent. The use of Blockchain technologies has already proven to be a valuable tool for banking. Ripple’s solutions have earned it specific strategic alliances such as SAMA and SANTANDER . But SWIFT does not want to be left behind in the race for technological innovation and is developing its own blockchain which in its preliminary results behaves “extremely well.” On an official Press Release early on March, Damien Vanderveken, Head of Research and Development, shared his optimism towards blockchain technologies:\nThe PoC went extremely well, proving the fantastic progress that has been made with DLT and the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 in particular ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank prefers bitcoin over swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T10:20:18.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d04568e11477718d1a3aa5b8633493f87c24a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFODplR8V0UdMo.tfI5oUO0BfL_KWQLiHwE2E0ggOxYRioBrVHdQMyT4A--", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Stainless Steel Collar Stays", "title_full": "Bitcoin Stainless Steel Collar Stays", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ySxZQc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d04568e11477718d1a3aa5b8633493f87c24a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFODplR8V0UdMo.tfI5oUO0BfL_KWQLiHwE2E0ggOxYRioBrVHdQMyT4A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Specials", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Stainless Steel Collar Stays", "text": "\nBitcoin Stainless Steel Collar Stays Our Bitcoin Stainless Steel Collar Stays are perfect as a wedding gift, birthday gift, housewarming gift, gift for dad, mom, groomsmen, bridesmaids or someone else in your life!

Subverting SWIFT\nFounded by German Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond is an online bank which now affords its customers the ability to transfer loans internationally — specifically, by using Bitcoin.\nThe platform uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to subvert SWIFT — the self-proclaimed world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services — by lending money around the world instantly and at virtually no cost. Albrecht explained to Reuters TV :\nTraditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nWhat makes this service even more remarkable is the fact that Bitbond became an officially licensed bank in 2016. How it Works\nBitbond works by letting clients hold their loans in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for extremely short periods of time before they are exchanged back into the receiving countries’ native fiat currency. This method keeps exchange rates relatively fixed and prevents the cryptocurrency market’s infamous volatility from undermining the process.\nAs noted by Reuters , this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been used as loan collateral. However, Bitbond is reportedly the first to offer the transfer of credit in currency internationally. As such, the company has become increasingly popular since it originally launched in 2013 — currently managing 100 clients’ loans for a rough total of $1 million each month.\nThe majority of said clients, Albrecht told Reuters , are small business owners or freelance workers, while the loans are less than $50,000 each. Germany Loves Bitcoin\nAs a side note, Germans have been particularly keen on adopting Bitcoin. According to Bitnodes, Germany has the second most Bitcoin nodes in the world — behind only the U.S.\nHowever, authorities in the European country haven’t historically been too keen on cryptocurrency. In February, interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier signed a letter to fellow G20 finance ministers, in which he claimed cryptocurrencies are not only risky for investors but also threaten long-term global financial stability.\nNevertheless, Germany did join 21 of its European neighbors in signing a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership on April 10.\nWhat do you think about a certified online bank subverting SWIFT by sending loans internationally with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?
