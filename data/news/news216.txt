outside of Warren Buffet’s office to remind him that he was wrong about Google and Amazon and warn him he may be wrong about bitcoin, too. The billboards went up shortly after Buffet dissed bitcoin during a Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders’ meeting.\nSome new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)\n#GenesisMining #Bitcoin #BitcoinAwareness pic.twitter.com/MxuKLwRS8L\n— Marco Krohn (@mkrohn5) May 16, 2018\nBillboards Constructed to Troll Warren Buffett Draw Community Support The billboards have drawn a lot of support from people on Twitter, some of whom speculate the investing guru doesn’t have any need for cryptocurrency given his wealth.\nOne tweeter suggested cryptocurrency will get Buffet’s attention when it is eventually used to tokenize conventional stocks.\nGenesis Mining’s bitcoin awareness billboard campaign is an effort to educate the public about bitcoin. One goal is to provide balance to the negative impressions that mainstream media often gives bitcoin.\nEarlier this month, Genesis Mining organized a “Bankers Against Bitcoin” demonstration at the 2018 Consensus blockchain conference in New York City. The protesters, who presented themselves as bankers, carried anti-bitcoin signs to convey the banking industry’s opposition to bitcoin.\nMarco Streng , CEO of Genesis Mining, noted on the Bankers Against Bitcoin website that decentralized technology marks the biggest competition banks have faced and noted that the protest represents what will happen to companies that fail to accept change.\nAlso read: Genesis Mining launches nationwide advocacy campaign\nCampaign Supports Bitcoin And Blockchain Warren Buffett More The website noted the #ExploreBitcoin project began two years ago to raise public awareness about bitcoin and blockchain and has already executed numerous campaigns to raise support for the nascent cryptocurrency.\nIn 2016, The campaign attacked JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a strident bitcoin critic , with mobile billboards circling the Miami Bitcoin Conference.\nIn 2017, the campaign criticized journalists for negative coverage of bitcoin.\nThe campaign has also sponsored signs on top of taxis in Florida that pointed out that the 10,000 bitcoins that purchased two pizzas in 2010 would be worth $2.4 million at the time they were printed. Another taxi sign noted that bitcoin is a technology, not a company or an organization.\nHighway billboards in San Francisco and Los Angeles advised people that they can send money for free using bitcoin.\nPeople carrying signs at Western Union stores in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York saying “It shouldn’t cost money to send money. Send money for free with bitcoin. Anytime, anywhere.”\nThe campaign has also provided images that can be posted on social media quoting Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, saying “Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.”\nMore campaigns, Streng says, will be coming.\nFeatured Image from Twitter\nThe post Bitcoin Mining Firm

This decreases the general supply of accessible Request tokens over time. There isn't any technical reason claimed for requiring this, nevertheless it does have a clear economic motive: artificially pushing up the value of the token. Be aware that the set price decreases inversely to the tokens worth appreciation as the community evolves and is extra regularly used, thus always sustaining their competitive low charges. Among the use instances include: normal requests, online payments, accounting, monetary audit, bitcoin talk at e-chat P2P and Point of Sale. Ethereum customers can buy firm-particular tokens bitcoin talk with ether, which they hope will enhance in worth as the corporate begins utilizing these tokens to perform their companies. REQ was listed on on the twenty seventh of October and whereas many had anticipated that adoption by the next quantity alternate could be price positive the ensuing calamity has had mixed results. Due to legal restrictions, residents and residents of the US and US ruled territories are restricted from participating in the Jibrel Community Token sale. Protocol - The core protocol capabilities of the network: Core Request protocol, multi-currency (cross chain verification and fiat), extensions for builders (Escrow, down payments and many others.), financial flows mechanism, cross-foreign money settlement (Kyber partnership), charges, repute and echat for bitcoin talk privacy & scaling. Nonetheless, Internet of Cash remains to be more than a year away from the release of their mainnet and isn't truly speaking across blockchains however as an alternative transferring value represented in hybrid tokens. Because of the large amounts of Standing ICO transactions and different Ethereum transactions taking place, the system primarily failed. A decentralized network built on prime of Ethereum, which permits anybody, anyplace to request a payment. The platform, where tokens circulate, has already been developed. Because of this, holding REQ tokens makes it a lucrative investment if it achieves community impact. For those who have any inquiries concerning where by as well as the best way to work with bitcoin talk , you possibly can contact us from our website. REQ tokens are ERC20 tokens that are necessary to participate in the network and create superior Requests. The cross-chain bridge answer proposed within the talked about above Polkadot undertaking and employed by the Oracles Network's provides interoperability of Ethereum-compatible blockchains, irrespectively to their consensus mechanisms. Second, as soon as the token sale begins, it is best to get distinctive deal with and information that you could bitcoin talk send Ethereum. My workforce and I've been working on growing an application, based mostly on a private ethereum community, due to the excessive fuel price of our contracts on the principle chain. As an investor the price that one will receive is proportional to using the Request Community. As a result of numerous ICOs and a feverish demand for brand spanking new tokens, the Ethereum fee has jumped greater than 40 fold since the beginning of the 12 months. (Omise ICO value was $zero.24 on 15 July; it trades today at $8.3). If buyers imagine request has 1 / 4 of the growth potential that OMG demonstrated we're set for some dramatic price motion. As for the Request hype engine; the reference to ING can be remarkably bullish for REQ value; the crypto area has fallen in love with marriages between new-tech and previous world institutions. Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, wrote a blog put up that highlights the advantages of the burning mechanism - On Medium-of-Trade Token Valuations He concludes that for a token to have secure value over time it is extremely helpful for the token supply to have sinks (sic burn) - locations where tokens truly disappear and so the whole token amount decreases over time\". Along with our management group, we have recruited some key advisors, together with Paul B. Allen, founding father of ; Michael B. Moore, former Coke model supervisor and present CEO of the International African American Museum; Christopher Penn, an knowledgeable in content advertising and in style keynote speaker; and Chris Pirillo, a true content material legend who constructed a tremendous brand across the LockerGnome.\" Our focus right here is on confirmed expertise and experience when it comes to branding, advertising, and content strategy. You don't have to fret about shedding ICX because tokens are kept in the individual's Ethereum wallet. We were chosen bitcointalk neo gold by the World Economic Forum's Tipping Level report as the \"Shift in Motion\" for Sensible Contracts, for our work on permitting good contracts within the Bitcoin community to be robotically triggered by exterior information. How it will all play out is still obscure until further developments on the Ethereum network are made. Cosmos has numerous potential use instances derived from its utility as a decentralized change that is interoperable with any blockchain. The Request crew even Blogged comparing the two.

JPMorgan is looking into the use of cryptocurrencies despite their purported threat to the bank’s current business model.\nOliver Harris was the bank’s former head of developing new financial technologies – now, he is looking into the risks and rewards associated with digital assets and blockchain technology as Bitcoin moves towards mainstream adoption.\nThe move may be related to JPMorgan’s competitor Goldman Sachs’ decision to hire Justin Schmidt, a trader specializing in exchanging cryptocurrencies. However, JPMorgan’s decision to look into blockchain assets is surprising, especially considering Dimon’s harsh remarks towards Bitcoin only nine months ago.\nIn January of 2018, Dimon recanted his prior statements when he told Fox he is open-minded with regards to blockchain assets:\n“The Bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about Bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I’m not interested that much in the subject at all. The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO’s you have to look at individually.”\nin addition to researching cryptocurrency assets for the banking giant, Harris will also be leading Quorum, the bank’s in-house blockchain project. According to a report from Reuters’ Anna Irrera, JPMorgan is considering turning Quorum into an independent company.\nBitcoin has been growing at a rate of 165% per year for the past six years, according to Pantera Capital’s CEO Dan Morehead.

As noted in our last discussion, a break back into the TR would be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to maintain support within the TR would likely lead to a continuation of the downtrend: Figure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Downtrend Continuation After establishing the Major Sign of Weakness (SOW), the market made a feeble rally and ultimately formed a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the point where supply begins to overwhelm the market and long positions begin to close as the demand dries up. Shortly after the rejection of the TR, the market established a new low. However, this low was pushed on fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping out a reversal pattern called a Falling Wedge (FW): Figure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Falling Wedge If the price manages to break out of this FW it will have a modest $1,000 move upward. The measured move would have us retesting the lower $9,000s once again. However, if we fail to gain enough momentum upward, we would likely test the macro 61% Fibonacci retracement values: Figure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Macro Fib Retracements Figure 4: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Macro 61% Closer View If we manage to test the 61%, this will again be a zone of evaluation as we wait to see how the market reacts to such strong, macro support. Summary: After a short-lived rally, bitcoin established a LPSY in the $8,800s before continuing to make new lows. Currently, the market is pushing new lows but on diminishing volume. The current price action is forming a Falling Wedge which, if it breaks upwards, would have a price target in the low $9,000s.

Mei Yamaguchi Before the fight began the champion fighter came out sporting a Bitcoin.com t-shirt that says ‘Bitcoin Cash’ and a ‘BCH PLS’ hat as the crowd went wild over Yamaguchi’s entrance. Yamaguchi’s cold stare had shown the crowd the MMA veteran was very serious about this re-match with Lee. As 138 countries watched during the first four rounds of the bout, it seemed Lee dominated Yamaguchi. A ton of punches and takedowns took place during the fight as each round timed out for the two Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belts. Mei Yamaguchi Put Up an Excellent Fight but in the End, Angela Lee Takes the Win The Bitcoin.com sponsored Yamaguchi threw some incredible punches at Lee but her adversary managed to come back. During the fifth and final round Yamaguchi came out swinging hard with many double leg takedowns, submissions, and threw lots of strikes from the bottom. After the fifth round of the Unstoppable Dreams bout the judges came to the decision that the Atomweight World Champion Angela Lee had won the fight. Lee then thanked her team for their support but also stated that Yamaguchi put up a tough fight as the Japanese veteran is very experienced.

Jonathan Koomey, a Standford lecturer who correctly illustrated how concerns over the early internet’s energy usage were dramatically unfounded, thinks researchers like de Vries are getting it wrong. Koomey told NBC News : For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to. De Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims: Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018. However, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey: The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would. Bitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries. De Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News: The only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices. Koomey added: The equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well. We should try to get the numbers right […] So, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process. Notes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq — Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018 It’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated: We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.

Linkedin, you're probably familiar with OTC bitcoin brokers. They'll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy\nBrokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1 Anyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to \"OTC Bitcoin Broker\" and you've done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it's necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing \"the big one\", has proliferated.\nHow an OTC Deal Works Sellers want to sell OTC to avoid the sort of slippage that occurs when unloading large amounts of BTC on an exchange. Whales also value their privacy, and while they are still required to undergo KYC to complete an OTC deal, their identity is only going to be shared with the broker, their attorney, and the escrow service. Normally, even the buyer won't know the identity of the person they are buying the coins from. The seller provides \"proof of satoshi\" by moving a fraction of a bitcoin from the wallet they control, the buyer provides proof of funds in the form of a bank certification of deposit or credit and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and a letter of intent (LOI) are signed. The process usually works as follows:\nAttorney for the buyer prepares LOI detailing terms including BTC purchase amount, commission, net discount and other details Proof of funds is provided within a specific timeframe of signing the LOI. A screenshot is not accepted: cryptographically provided proof of coin, sent via the blockchain, is required Master Fee Protection Agreement as well as Draft Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement may then be circulated and signed by all parties Money is placed in escrow, escrow verifies receipt of funds and BTC is sent to buyer's wallet Transfer may be done in full or in tranches depending on the agreement Given the desire of buyer and seller to preserve their privacy, and the need for each party to be connected in the first place, brokers play a vital role. But due to the lucrative prize at stake, it's a job that attracts a lot of chancers – and a lot of Linkedin requests, much to the chagrin of other cryptocurrency users.\nHave you been contacted by bitcoin brokers and do you think they're a nuisance or an essential link in the OTC chain?

If you buy an apartment house you’re looking at the apartment house of your biopharmaceuticals farmed. If you buy a whole business you’re looking at how the business does. If you buy a part of a business why shouldn’t you look at how the businesses are going to do it.\nPeople get charmed by buy lots of action and the fact that things are liquid and all of that and it does have repercussions back into the market when you get something like 80 an arrangement on the supercharges on the VIX. I mean where you can lose 90 percent of your money in one day. I mean that really doesn’t belong with the word investment. I mean it’s just it’s gambling in terms of crypto currencies. I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending. Now when it happens or how or anything else.\nI don’t know but I know this. I could buy a five year put out every one of the crypto currencies. I’d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime’s worth I do think. I think what’s going on definitely will come to. And we don’t own any we’re not sure that they will ever have a position in them. It’s out of currency. I mean it does not meet the test of a currency. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s not around in 10 or 20 years.\nPeople say well I’ll show you goods and the coins but they change the price of those every the price of the dollar changes in relation because they’re pricing off the dollar. They could say well I’ll sell it to you in barrels of oil but if they every time the price of oil changes they change the number of barrels you have to have that’s your oil is not the currency. Well generally non-productive assets remain. If you bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it you know in maybe a couple of tenths of one percent. The it’s essentially is not going to deliver anything other than supposing scarcity because only you can only mine so many but so what. I mean what is what does it produces self. You know the check is a wonderful idea.\nJust imagine what it will be without being able to write checks or have wire transfer funds. But it doesn’t make the check intrinsically itself worth a lot of money. And if you said you can use something called check with a little piece of paper you do something else to transfer money. I think that any time you buy a non-productive asset you are counting on somebody else later on to buy a non-productive asset because they think they can sell it to somebody for more money. And it’s been tried with tulips and it’s been it’s been tried with various things over time and it does come to a bad ending.\nI mean having you have a hard time you can you can think of the good Rawle and I mean the Louisiana Purchase was say 15 million dollars for eight hundred thousand or so square miles of lighting them back. You’re sitting on land that came with the Louisiana Purchase. And and so what we pay we paid 20 bucks a square mile and you know six hundred forty acres and a square mile and you’re down to three cents or something. So that was a pretty good purchase of and what was then a nonproductive property but it did depend. But it’s very hard. You can buy stamps.\nBill Gross got a wonderful stamp collection and sold for more money in the end. But it depended on somebody else wanting to buy hoping they will sell it for more money and so on. And in the end you make your money out of productive assets if you buy a farm you.\nYou try to estimate what the crops what amount per acre of soybeans or corn or whatever may be raised and how much you have to pay the farmer farms it for you and what your taxes will be various things and you make a conclusion based on what the asset itself will produce over time.\nAnd that’s an investment when you buy something because you’re hoping tomorrow morning you’re going to wake up you know the price will be higher. It’s going to be you know you need more people coming into the interleaving and and they and you can get that and that will feed off for a while and some time for a long while and sometimes do extraordinary numbers.\nBut in the end they come to bad endings and crypto currencies will come the bad endings and along with the fact that there are nothing being produced in the way of value from the asset. You also have the problem that it draws in a lot of charlatans and that sort of thing who are trying to create various sorts of exchanges or whatever it may be it. You know it’s something where where people who are of less than stellar character see an opportunity to clip people who are trying to get rich because their neighbors are getting rich buying the stuff that neither one of them understands. It will come to a bad ending Charlie. Well I like your broker currencies a lot less than you do. And so to me it’s just dementia. And I think if people were professional traders they’d go into trading crypto currencies.\nIt’s it’s just disgusting. It’s like somebody else is trading turds and you decide I can’t be left out. To the extent that this writing were being webcast around the world I hope some of our stuff doesn’t translate very well. We see your thoughts stay away from a day away from the Mirage. Basically I made that. It’s a method of transmitting money. It’s very effective way of transmitting money and do it anonymously and all that a check is a way of transmitting money to Chechnya or the whole thing because they can transmit money orders transmit money money order people do it. I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it but you could replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be and the idea that it has something huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view. Checks are actually drawn. You’re drawing upon something that’s not there.\nYou’re transferring the money dollars on both and the to which is a very fast money order.

Non credo esistano degli speculatori che facciano delle manovre di questa ampiezza e per così tanti mesi, senza realizzare a breve i loro guadagni.\nSecondo me è successo quello che hai detto te, ma ad innescare il forte rialzo sono state le balene speculatrici e poi è andata avanti come hai detto te grazie allenorne fomo. Poi hanno aspettato che il prezzo fosse salito abbastanza ma soprattutto fino al punto che sarebbe si cresciuto ancora ma non abbastanza velocemente come nelle settimane precedenti (ormai la maggior parte del parco buoi era stato catturato) e a quel punto hanno iniziato a vendere, innescando il ciclo al contrario.\nOra il prezzo sta tornando ai valori pre-bolla con i caratteristici cicli di questo andamento, tornato a quei livelli, il prezzo tornerà a crescere (o a decrescere) fisiologicamente e parallelamente allo sviluppo e alla diffusione di questa tecnologia, come daltronde stava già facendo prima di questa fortissima ondata di speculazione.

They’ll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy Brokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1\nAnyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to “OTC Bitcoin Broker” and you’ve done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it’s necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing “the big one”, has proliferated. How an OTC Deal Works\nSellers want to sell OTC to avoid the sort of slippage that occurs when unloading large amounts of BTC on an exchange. Whales also value their privacy, and while they are still required to undergo KYC to complete an OTC deal, their identity is only going to be shared with the broker, their attorney, and the escrow service. Normally, even the buyer won’t know the identity of the person they are buying the coins from. The seller provides “proof of satoshi” by moving a fraction of a bitcoin from the wallet they control, the buyer provides proof of funds in the form of a bank certification of deposit or credit and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and a letter of intent (LOI) are signed. The process usually works as follows: Attorney for the buyer prepares LOI detailing terms including BTC purchase amount, commission, net discount and other details Proof of funds is provided within a specific timeframe of signing the LOI. A screenshot is not accepted: cryptographically provided proof of coin, sent via the blockchain, is required Master Fee Protection Agreement as well as Draft Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement may then be circulated and signed by all parties Money is placed in escrow, escrow verifies receipt of funds and BTC is sent to buyer’s wallet Transfer may be done in full or in tranches depending on the agreement\nGiven the desire of buyer and seller to preserve their privacy, and the need for each party to be connected in the first place, brokers play a vital role. But due to the lucrative prize at stake, it’s a job that attracts a lot of chancers – and a lot of Linkedin requests, much to the chagrin of other cryptocurrency users.

They'll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy\nBrokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1 Anyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to \"OTC Bitcoin Broker\" and you've done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it's necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing \"the big one\", has proliferated.\nHow an OTC Deal Works Sellers want to sell OTC to avoid the sort of slippage that occurs when unloading large amounts of BTC on an exchange. Whales also value their privacy, and while they are still required to undergo KYC to complete an OTC deal, their identity is only going to be shared with the broker, their attorney, and the escrow service. Normally, even the buyer won't know the identity of the person they are buying the coins from. The seller provides \"proof of satoshi\" by moving a fraction of a bitcoin from the wallet they control, the buyer provides proof of funds in the form of a bank certification of deposit or credit and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and a letter of intent (LOI) are signed. The process usually works as follows:\nAttorney for the buyer prepares LOI detailing terms including BTC purchase amount, commission, net discount and other details Proof of funds is provided within a specific timeframe of signing the LOI. A screenshot is not accepted: cryptographically provided proof of coin, sent via the blockchain, is required Master Fee Protection Agreement as well as Draft Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement may then be circulated and signed by all parties Money is placed in escrow, escrow verifies receipt of funds and BTC is sent to buyer's wallet Transfer may be done in full or in tranches depending on the agreement Given the desire of buyer and seller to preserve their privacy, and the need for each party to be connected in the first place, brokers play a vital role. But due to the lucrative prize at stake, it's a job that attracts a lot of chancers – and a lot of Linkedin requests, much to the chagrin of other cryptocurrency users.\nHave you been contacted by bitcoin brokers and do you think they're a nuisance or an essential link in the OTC chain?

"text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators’ net short dollar position slid to its lowest level in 12 weeks, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.\nU.S. dollar banknote is seen in this picture illustration taken May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration The value of the net short dollar position was $9.82 billion in the week ended May 15, from $10.84 billion the previous week. The net short dollar position has declined for four straight weeks.\nU.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.\nIn a wider measure of dollar positioning <0#NETUSDFX=> that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position equivalent to $11.02 billion, down from $13.31 billion the previous week.\nThat was the lowest net short dollar positioning in four months.\nSince mid-April, the dollar has rallied by more than 5 percent, underpinned by rising U.S. Treasury yields and solid economic data that puts the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least two more times this year.\nHowever, Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities, believes the dollar’s rally should prove temporary, although he said for now there is further room for the greenback to extend its gains.\nBut he expects that once global economic trends become more stable and major foreign central banks start signalling they would adjust monetary policy later this year, the dollar should resume its downtrend.\nIn the cryptocurrency market, speculators’ net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures rose to 1,874 contracts <0#1CFTC1330E1> from 1,635 the previous week, the data showed.\nAfter a downtrend in the first few months of the year, bitcoin has stabilized between $8,000 and $9,000. It last traded at $8,229.91, up 2.2 percent on the day on the Bitstamp platform.\nFundstrat in a research note on Friday said the CME posted record volumes in the past week for bitcoin futures, which suggests institutional interest on the virtual currency is rising.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Matthew Lewis\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary market", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:33:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8113592cfbf7eb68a584373e0d07a394e4b57038", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pUKtw9WG24bUQ2eE3uyo1fO.OcYngqeFcbohJ4r5tPWgYfHhzyEvhlt.sC7QvGpQL17oZcOgv0uRZrWYwdEYokhgc10nne_qANQdpERopFfWDqRVOaGnWPK4w67PXkSvZM0hZyH.XnlURbOq0SVNPOg--", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II Promises to Reveal New Profit Opportunities from the Next …", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II Promises to Reveal New Profit Opportunities from the Next …", "published": "2018-05-19T05:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PR14-Image-1024x536.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8113592cfbf7eb68a584373e0d07a394e4b57038", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pUKtw9WG24bUQ2eE3uyo1fO.OcYngqeFcbohJ4r5tPWgYfHhzyEvhlt.sC7QvGpQL17oZcOgv0uRZrWYwdEYokhgc10nne_qANQdpERopFfWDqRVOaGnWPK4w67PXkSvZM0hZyH.XnlURbOq0SVNPOg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-19T05:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II Promises to Reveal New Profit Opportunities from the Next …", "text": " by 0\nDALLAS, TX – In February, the Bitcoin Ethereum and Blockchain Super Conference brought together hundreds of cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts, investors, and leaders. Now, the organizer and host, Richard Jacobs, is hosting a second conference at Dallas this September.\nMr. Jacobs says the Bitcoin, Ethereum & Blockchain Super Conference II will disclose new information – revealed by select industry leaders – that elevates cryptocurrency and blockchain investment opportunities to the next level. Tickets for the conference are available now.\n“Before I even made it home from the first conference, my inbox was overflowing with emails asking when we were having a second conference, and how they could secure a ticket early”, said Mr. Jacobs. “Right then, I knew we had a responsibility to take everything to the next level.” Mr. Jacobs took the overwhelming response seriously.\nThe new conference, coming to Dallas this September, is appropriately dubbed the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II. Richard Jacobs, the organizer of the Bitcoin, Ethereum & Blockchain Super Conference II, is also the publisher of Future Tech Podcast, Crypto News Insider, and the author of the book Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain: Surprising Insights from 200+ Podcast Interviews of Industry Insiders.\nThe main focus of this second conference will be on the next bull run of Bitcoin, which, just like with the 2017 bull run, could happen at any moment. This time around, informed investors who buy in early before the price shoots could be the next class of “crypto millionaires”.
