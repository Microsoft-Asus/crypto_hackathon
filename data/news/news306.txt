With just days left there are a few things BCH holders and full node operators should know before the upgrade takes place this coming Tuesday.\nAlso read: Japan’s GMO Has Mined Over 900 Bitcoins – Hashrate Doubled Last Month Just a Few Days Left Until the May 15th Bitcoin Cash Upgrade\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is about to perform the largest block size increase ever as the upgrade will expand the block size by 4X on May 15, 2018. The development team has also added ‘Satoshi OP_Codes,’ and the fork will also increase the protocol’s default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes. Unless you run a BCH full node implementation there is not much a common user needs to do, except refrain from transacting during the upgrade. The Hard Fork Activation Will Use the Median Time Past Method\nThe BCH fork on May 15 will be similar to the fork activations that took place on August 1, and the DAA fork that took place this past November. This means the activation will take place on May 15, but there won’t be specific block height, because the upgrade will activate based on ‘Median Time Past’ (MTP). The initiation of the hard fork will begin on Tuesday, May 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade will not be implemented until the MTP timestamp and the processing of 11 blocks equal to or greater than 1,526,400,000 takes place. Following this period after the next block, the 32MB upgrade will be live on the BCH network. Full Node Clients and Miners Must Update Software\nFull node operators need to upgrade their Bitcoin Cash clients as soon as possible, before the fork begins. ABC users can download the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version here , and those operating other full nodes like Bitcoin Unlimited, or XT should upgrade to the client that supports the 32MB increase. At the moment looking at data for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a great majority of nodes have already upgraded to the latest 0.17.1 ABC version. Full node operators and miners are required to upgrade their software in order to participate during and after the network change. Ordinary Users Should Refrain from Transacting With BCH During the Upgrade and Patiently Wait for the Fork to Complete It is best not to transact with BCH during the May 15th Bitcoin Cash upgrade.\nOrdinary users don’t have to do much of anything, except keep up to date with current events concerning the fork, and its best not to transact during the activation period as well. This means if you don’t have to send money on May 15, then wait until the fork is complete before transacting with BCH. It’s always a good measure to look out for any updates provided by your exchange or wallet provider to make sure the platform you use is ready to accept the network changes. If your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s probably safe to assume that the exchange or wallet provider is ready for the upgrade. So on May 15 if your money is on an exchange or held within a non-custodial wallet all you really have to do is patiently wait until the fork is finished. Last November’s Successful Hard Fork Shows There Shouldn’t be Any Complications\nThe May 15th Bitcoin Cash fork that will change the protocol’s base block size to 32 MB, while adding some other interesting features will be quite a milestone for the BCH community. The last fork that took place this November was successful , and the new Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has worked flawlessly ever since. The 32MB increase will be much larger than the already sizable 8MB blocks, and the upgrade will likely be a historic day for public blockchain consensus upgrades.\nWhat do you think about the fork taking place on May 15 that will increase the base block size to 32 MB?

IT will be the first cryptocurrency app offered by the company which is also the world’s third-biggest mobile phone manufacturer.\nThe AppGallery will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor smartphones while the company will soon release it for its older devices as well. The addition of bitcoin wallets will have a much bigger impact on the Chinese market which is a hotbed for cryptocurrencies.\nIn China, access to apps like BTC.com is limited as the government has blocked Google Play store and some parts of Apple App Store in the country.

However, the innovation is not yet user-ready since there are many pending solutions and features still under development.\nLighting network is a method where transactions are made on off-chain channels and therefore users on the receiving end can receive the payments or cryptocurrencies without having to wait for mining of a block on the main chain and also by avoiding associating miner’s fees.\nLightning network has immense potential, from facilitating quick transactions, reducing cost of transactions to facilitating swaps between different blockchains. Just recently, Igor Cota announced they are working on Presto, a solution that would enable near-field communication (NFC) – to allow users to make contactless payments where they initiate payments by tapping their devices to payment terminals.\nHowever, there are a number of hurdles that the innovation will need to overcome before lightning network become a reality. For instance, there is still no ready lightning network application for use every day by people. This is because there are a number of challenges and features still under development. The Hebrew University assistant professor Aviv Zohar, said:\n“Lightning has a ton of challenges ahead of it. I don’t want to be too negative. It’s amazing stuff”.\nHe says that there’s this huge gap between what’s doable and what’s usable: the usability challenge. He adds that there are certain user experiences that do not have solutions — or adequate solutions yet.\nLightning Labs , the company behind implementation of lnd lightning network (now in beta and ready for mainnet use) even publishes a blog post envisioning how lightning network could be in use by end users without any tech skills to buy end-user products such as a pair of socks or pizza as if the end user was swiping a credit card. The company, however, recently tweeted “we recommend that users experiment with only small amounts (#craefulgang #craefulgang #craefulgang)!” Additionally, the company is yet to release the mobile version in order to minimize the risk for users. The desktop app is still restricted to “testnet”– that is, fake money.\nCoinClip and HTLC.me, which are testnet lnd apps for iOS and supporting lightning features, are not yet releases to minimize risk for users. The developer behind Zap Jack Mallers told CoinDesk that lightning network will soon be good enough for more non-technical users.\n“One day it will be good enough for exchanges, one day it will be good enough for Amazon.”\nHe says people uses to “roadmaps of products” but lightning is “a protocol and not a product so there’s not a ship date”.\nACINQ is running the “eclair” lightning implementation and unveiled an Android wallet app in the beginning of April, which supports mainnet lightning payments. However, the app cannot receive payments yet.\nThere are many tech features that are not yet released for lightning network to function fully. One of those is “watchtowers”. It seeks to deal with the problem where its is possible for a user of a channel to steal another user’s funds. If the victim logs on before the given amount of time passes and notices that the amount was to be stolen, they can punish the would-be thief by pushing their funds in the channel. Watchtowers watches the network and will punish the would-be thief in the network in exchange for a small fee.\nAlthough “watchtower” cab may improve the situation to have users monitor the channel when they create a channel. Thus need a certain number of confirmations to make sure it is accepting. It will take time to be built into a sleek UX. Despite much time taken, user experience is daunting, and that might continue because only a few people are working on the UX for cryptocurrency protocols and technologies.\n“Splicing” is another mechanism that allows a user who wants to send more Bitcoin than available. Thus it is to being in additional funds into the channel and make the payment. The method will also allow Bitcoin users without a lightning node to receive lightning-based payments.\nAnother feature is “submarine swaps” under development by Bosworth. It is a version of atomic swap where one side of swap is done on-chain and the other off-chain. It could help swaps between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, for instance. The funds a locked on a smart contract. “Submarine swaps” could be helpful on decentralized crypto exchanges, for instance where one user cannot take another user’s altcoins without giving the Bitcoin in exchange. usability and challenges of Bitcoin lightning network?

This means the activation will take place on May 15, but there won’t be specific block height, because the upgrade will activate based on ‘Median Time Past’ (MTP). The initiation of the hard fork will begin on Tuesday, May 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade will not be implemented until the MTP timestamp and the processing of 11 blocks equal to or greater than 1,526,400,000 takes place.

Full Node Clients and Miners Must Update Software\nFull node operators need to upgrade their Bitcoin Cash clients as soon as possible, before the fork begins. ABC users can download the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version here , and those operating other full nodes like Bitcoin Unlimited, or XT should upgrade to the client that supports the 32MB increase. At the moment looking at data for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a great majority of nodes have already upgraded to the latest 0.17.1 ABC version. Full node operators and miners are required to upgrade their software in order to participate during and after the network change. Ordinary Users Should Refrain from Transacting With BCH During the Upgrade and Patiently Wait for the Fork to Complete It is best not to transact with BCH during the May 15th Bitcoin Cash upgrade.\nOrdinary users don’t have to do much of anything, except keep up to date with current events concerning the fork, and its best not to transact during the activation period as well. This means if you don’t have to send money on May 15, then wait until the fork is complete before transacting with BCH. It’s always a good measure to look out for any updates provided by your exchange or wallet provider to make sure the platform you use is ready to accept the network changes. If your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s probably safe to assume that the exchange or wallet provider is ready for the upgrade. So on May 15 if your money is on an exchange or held within a non-custodial wallet all you really have to do is patiently wait until the fork is finished.

The BTC wallet claims to have more than one million users, having processed USD$ 5 billion since 2015. Since the Google Play Store is not available in China due to the Great Firewall, BTC’s App represents a significant opportunity to capture a solid portion of the market share in China. BTC says the Huawei AppGallery will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones, starting with Huawei P20, and will be rolled out to older devices during Q2 2018.\nAlejandro de la Torre, VP of Business Operations of BTC.com, says they are “democratizing Bitcoin” by breaking down barriers.\n“…new users can access Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a simple, secure and trusted environment. China is almost a ‘cashless economy’ today, accounting for almost 62% of all global mobile transactions. This dwarfs the estimated $49.3 billion in total mobile payment transactions in the United States in 2017, which highlights the amazing opportunity cryptocurrencies have in replacing fiat currency as the currency of choice for mobile payments. Huawei is leading the way in terms of adoption of blockchain technologies, and we’re excited to bring BTC.com to Huawei’s user base for the first time.”\nMore than 95% of internet users in China use their mobile devices to access the internet. There are approximately 717 smartphone users in the country that is quite a bit higher than the number of smartphones in the US. Thus, BTC.com and Huawei may create a digital bridge to onboard millions of new Chinese cryptocurrency users.\nDr. Jaime Gonzalo, VP of Huawei Mobile Services, believes that cryptocurrencies have expanded the human understanding of digital economy;\n“From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future. That is the reason why Huawei selected BTC.com as our recommended quality app to manage digital currencies. In addition to being simple and secure to use, BTC.com offers an exclusive reward to all AppGallery users by gifting a starting amount of cryptocurrency.”\nFive manufacturers now account for three out of four mobile devices sold in China. In the third quarter of 2017, Huawei accounted for 19.4 of the market share according to a November report by IDC.\nSponsored Links by DQ Promote You may also like...

The Chelan PUD said a recent moratorium from mid-March on new bitcoin mining operations has angered some would be miners. There have been incidents and while it hasn’t lead to calls to the police, the PUD’s Customer service director and spokesperson did admit that tensions have run high.\nThey said part of the tension is coming from the fact that bitcoin miners want to set up their operations fast, they can do it nearly overnight. Andrew Windell, Chelan PUD’s customer service director, said it’s caused problems. “They want it (power & electricity) as fast as they can get it,” Windell said.\nLarge Scale Bitcoin mining, with shipping containers, giant cooling fans, and self-built substations are changing the landscape near Wenatchee.\nScroll down to continue reading\nMore news from KIRO 7\nContent Continues Below\nLindsey Baum found: Missing McCleary girl's remains found in Eastern Washington Tacoma police arrest suspect in 1986 child murder case Police: 11-year-old girl attacked in mall restroom, father tackles suspect in food court How Seattle spent $54 million on homelessness in 2017 Police: Pit bull attacks Jehovah's Witnesses at front door DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP\nWindell said Chelan County’s moratorium on new operations, angering miners who’ve wanted to set up shop.\n“There are applications on hold and people are frustrated with that,” he said.\nThe Chelan PUD said it was going to put ballistic paneling in its lobby, get more security cameras and start other security measures, there haven’t been fistfights with angry miners, and some of the changes were planned, but Windell said the measures are welcome.\n“Some of the applicants have increased the sense of urgency of getting those security measures taken care of,” he said.\nCentral Washington is the gold rush region for bitcoin mining. Miners set up computer banks to do complex equations to obtain bitcoin online, spending an immense amount of power and time.\nHydroelectric power gives them cheap power and ideal location.\nLauren Miehe has been in the area since 2012 when the bitcoin mining rush began and said the last few months have shifted urgency for some miners trying to stake a claim in the area.\n“Ever since the spike in Bitcoin price in mid-December you’ve had an inundation of bitcoin applications,” Miehe said.\nMiehe is a former miner himself, who helps others set up, but is also working with a larger firm. He said the bitcoin industry could pave the way to other high-tech industries for the region which could also rely on inexpensive electricity. He stressed that confrontations between miners and utilities serve no one.\n“If anything those are our partners and we want to have a good relationship with them,” he said.\nWindell said another security issue for Chelan PUD; unauthorized bitcoin mining, maybe 100-to-200 illegal ops. He said some of them are in residential areas with unsanctioned wiring that pose fire hazards, could cause electrocutions or damage transformers.\n“When a cryptocurrency miner does not understand that safety risk but understands that we’re going to disconnect power that can lead to a contentious situation,” Windell said.\nChelan County may lift its mining moratorium, allowing for new operations. The security concerns could subside as noisy anger is replaced by noisy new facilities. Windell said managing the revolution will take time and will have to happen on the utility’s timetable not the miners.\n“We are in uncharted territory with this entire crypto currency development,” he said.\nChelan County’s meeting on the bitcoin mining operation moratorium is coming up Monday. It’s expected that they could hear testimony from both sides on ending or extending the moratorium.\nLauren Miehe believes the moratorium will not be lifted. The Chelan PUD has said that it is working to bring unauthorized mining operations into compliance, or shut them down if they prove to be a hazard.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/police-pit-bull-attacks-jehovahs-witnesses-at-front-door/746144293", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/lindsey-baum-found-missing-mccleary-girls-remains-found-in-eastern-washington/747317036", "https://kironewsapp.com/", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/how-seattle-spent-54-million-on-homelessness-in-2017/747078192", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/eastside-news/crews-will-try-fixing-failing-dam-in-alpine-lakes-wilderness/747462089#continue-below", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending-now/police-11yearold-girl-attacked-in-mall-restroom-father-tackles-suspect-in-food-court/746640146", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/eastside-news/crews-will-try-fixing-failing-dam-in-alpine-lakes-wilderness/747462089&quot;,&quot;pgType&quot;:&quot;story&quot;,&quot;pgId&quot;:&quot;747462089&quot;}", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/tacoma-police-identify-suspect-in-1986-child-murder-case/747248050"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "windell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew windell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccleary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey baum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chelan co pud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan pud", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "central washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wash.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern washington tacoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenatchee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan pud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T10:39:46.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8dcd9d39d787a6ca2c28ebddbd55db06454de96e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YkgaGNBhz3dj.kUn5p.AP3._IQvvF0ghrhNipikuq2reZmIVV9B2KAwlUxbGAmvWSGPcHSbUJB9Lb13wtAT93qdA-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Does anyone have a link to a video explaining bitcoin for a less tech savy person?", "title_full": "Does anyone have a link to a video explaining bitcoin for a less tech savy person? : btc", "published": "2018-05-11T08:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8dcd9d39d787a6ca2c28ebddbd55db06454de96e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YkgaGNBhz3dj.kUn5p.AP3._IQvvF0ghrhNipikuq2reZmIVV9B2KAwlUxbGAmvWSGPcHSbUJB9Lb13wtAT93qdA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Roey17", "published": "2018-05-11T08:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Does anyone have a link to a video explaining bitcoin for a less tech savy person?", "text": "This video is not for myself but for some people in my family, they are convinced that Bitcoin is a scam.

The AppGallery will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones and will be rolled out to older devices in the coming months, he said.\nThe move will likely have the most impact in the Chinese market, where Huawei is the biggest mobile phone seller. The nation has been a hotbed for cryptocurrencies.\nThe Chinese government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some sections of Apple’s iTunes, limiting access to apps like BTC.com’s.\nWhile China has shut down cryptocurrency trading platforms and initial coin offerings, people can still own virtual currencies.\n“It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market,” de la Torre said in a telephone interview. “The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.”\nBTC.com, which also controls the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies.\nHuawei is considering developing a mobile phone targeting blockchain-based applications, Bloomberg News reported in March.\n“From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future,” Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "huawei techn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:37:18.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27b06d5c3141d89aa21a5efc8e94f4574abb4986", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipF2YZiB_H.5jx3OMJEsV8YKFs48UM0hTapuHnKGHeYtzlNlCVkpd1RaFOw_j9EpI3BkjWNX8TN5wHqa234Pb6ZQgYZLjXR2pcJ.4fkGfJRA8YTgeVgLuIo8pu0ZRUqkrHQ7XiIEE6yKs-", "site_full": "www.asit.com.es", "site": "asit.com.es", "site_section": "http://www.asit.com.es/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest News As It Comes!", "title": "Bitcoin set to be SURPASSED in the crypto realm?

Price is also inside an ascending channel on its 1-hour chart and appears to be setting its sights on the top. A continuation of the rally could take bitcoin price up to the $9500 level. Bitcoin price bounced off the bottom of its ascending channel pattern on the 1-hour chart to show that bulls are still in the game.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, the rally is more likely to continue than to reverse. However, the gap between the moving averages has narrowed to signal weaker bullish momentum.\nIf a downward crossover materializes, bitcoin price could fall back to the channel support at $9000 for another test. Stochastic is already dipping into overbought territory to reflect exhaustion among buyers, which suggests that sellers have a chance at taking over.\nMarket Factors\nThe dollar got a boost even after a brief selloff during the FOMC statement. Policymakers made some notable changes in their actual statement, leading some to have doubts about the pace of tightening in the months ahead.\nBitcoin price has managed to stay resilient, though, as Goldman Sachs reportedly has plans to have bitcoin trading operations. This way, it can allow its clients to invest some of their funds in the industry, which would be supportive of liquidity and volumes.\nAs it is, bitcoin is already gaining adoption as a store of value and medium of exchange, which could continue to keep prices supported. Apart from that, many expect more exchanges to go live or tap into more markets, also supporting trade activity.\nLastly, the emergence of ETFs based on bitcoin could create simpler ways for the investing public to enter the space.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis for 05/03/2018 – Can Bulls Keep Charging? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fomc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T08:12:30.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbbf9de4728f939abdd70687d09af49d2b53930f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhI.wnC_F7AZUHDJxDmX5n3o-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T08:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbbf9de4728f939abdd70687d09af49d2b53930f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhI.wnC_F7AZUHDJxDmX5n3o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T08:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 11, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Developers Build Prototype for 'Dandelion' Privacy Tool CoinDesk Developers hoping to bring a higher level of transaction anonymity to the bitcoin blockchain have built a prototype for their \"Dandelion\" privacy project.

However, after looking into the Anonymous Bitcoin fork coming I think Sept. 10, am I bonkers for wanting to buy back into ZCL now when it's cheap and then selling when it spikes come August and September? Just like, throwing a couple hundred into it and see what happens?\nThe risk is ZCL never goes up, and even goes down, and I'm stuck with the bag at a loss. But the reward, to me, might outweigh any risk, because knowing what I know now from the BTCP snapshot and fork, ZCL will likely go up, even if only by a little. Like it or not, believe BTCA is a scam coin or not (which I believe), there are almost always gullible people willing to buy when they're promised free coins. Whether I make one dollar or ten thousand on it, that would still be worth the gamble to me.\nConvince me what I'm thinking is foolish, though, please.

It’s what Knightsbridge strives for, however as with all things wonderful, it doesn’t come easy and that’s why they have a well tested formula for success supported by proven systems to ensure that the journey to the races is just as exciting as those final few seconds over the finish line.\nThe success of syndications throughout the world has ensured that you don’t have to be a billionaire to enjoy the sport. As a shareholder in a Knightsbridge racehorse you can enjoy all the perks of owning one outright at a fraction of the cost, but with all the thrills.\nFrom the day you select your horse you will enjoy consistent updates throughout the various educational stages of its life. From the breaking in process at the Farm after its acquisition at auction, throughout its time in the paddock for a growth spurt and its first time at the stable to learn what life in a racing stable is all about.\nYou may choose to become a involved at the broodmare level and breed your very own champion.\nAs a Knightsbridge owner you’re encouraged to take trips to the farm to watch your horse at rest and see how it has benefited from time in the paddock. You’re encouraged to stop into the stable and see the physical changes and development it has made throughout its training – you’re also encouraged to attend the special track work sessions organised, exclusively for Knightsbridge owners, to see your race horse be put through its paces first-hand.\nWe know that being well informed on your horse’s progress and plans is crucial to your experience. That is why we have implemented technological systems designed to keep you completely up-to-date. Regular emails, progress pictures, newsletters, audio files, videos, phone calls and text messages are our primary forms of contact. In fact, you will receive weekly updates as the bare minimum. You will also receive exclusive benefits reserved for Knightsbridge owners e.g. weekly runners sheet including pre-race thoughts, tips, gifts and behind the scenes experiences etc.\nOn race day you can expect a ticket into the Members’ Area along with an Owners’ Pass to get ‘up close and personal’ with your horse, trainer and jockey in the mounting yard* to hear the inside word from your trainer and jockey. Following the race you’re welcomed into the track’s designated Owners Room to discuss the race and enjoy a glass of champagne with the team and your co-owners.\nWith consistent communication and an ‘open door’ mentality, our aim is to never have you left wondering what progress your four legged athlete has made recently, how it has performed at track work or the latest tip from the mounting yard come race day.\nKnightbridge offer this in the USA, Singapore, Malaysia, China and the UAE\nIf you are interested call at +1 631 482 0376 or email at [email protected]\nKnightsbridge to Accept Bitcoin and Ethereum for Race Horses and More added by Shayne Heffernan on May 11, 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "http://knightsbridgebloodstock.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://www.g-bit.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eth knightsbridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knightsbridge bloodstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kings", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "knightsbridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:58:15.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe6ba9da2d7ad8ee38c69a9f136dcfc86e0e23c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smlnPkGnoUWNOVRh2BW37Z4mDwndDIjeGEl6xFbBmyotYvaXzzCe0ds-", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "finding my lost bitcoin", "title_full": "finding my lost bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe6ba9da2d7ad8ee38c69a9f136dcfc86e0e23c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smlnPkGnoUWNOVRh2BW37Z4mDwndDIjeGEl6xFbBmyotYvaXzzCe0ds-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "finding my lost bitcoin", "text": "finding my lost bitcoin\n/u/MarkWalker1990\nMany years ago i bought bitcoin but i don't remember what the app i used was... i think it may have had Bee or a beehive. anyways, i'm wondering how i can find my lost coin? i imagine it must have gone up in value by now. i know its wishful thinking but i figured y'all could help.\nsubmitted by /u/MarkWalker1990\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T08:03:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aec6365af79da44ab9c58c64d77a1f17e1e6a5ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4Wam_pHZNYW.QsbC6QwbAtcxXX1SuIGpu2ZT0b24TvaCumsYLOe5dnI6PkL.KHfO0iWNhCB1E9DU6KUs106J6v.3MnVoXiF91BJfaGxjFeTVA-", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.in/rss_tag_section_feeds.cms?query=sai", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Insider India", "title": "Nvidia's bitcoin boom is over, but this investor says the bigger opportunity is just starting", "title_full": "Nvidia's bitcoin boom is over, but this investor says the bigger opportunity is just starting", "published": "2018-05-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/64116759/Nvidias-bitcoin-boom-is-over-but-this-investor-says-the-bigger-opportunity-is-just-starting.jpg?115689", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 22, "comments": 0, "shares": 22}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aec6365af79da44ab9c58c64d77a1f17e1e6a5ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4Wam_pHZNYW.QsbC6QwbAtcxXX1SuIGpu2ZT0b24TvaCumsYLOe5dnI6PkL.KHfO0iWNhCB1E9DU6KUs106J6v.3MnVoXiF91BJfaGxjFeTVA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nvidia's bitcoin boom is over, but this investor says the bigger opportunity is just starting", "text": "Nvidia's bitcoin boom is over, but this investor says the bigger opportunity is just starting Troy Wolverton May 11, 2018, 05.16 AM Sort By: Be the first one to comment.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,640 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $1,500 and $1,480 support levels to avoid more declines. Bitcoin cash price trimmed yesterday's gains against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now back below $1,600 with a few bearish signs near $1,520.\nBitcoin Cash Price Support There were a couple of attempts by bitcoin cash price to break the $1,650 resistance against the US Dollar. The price failed to move above $1,650 and started a downside move. It declined sharply and trimmed most its yesterday's gains. During the decline, it broke the $1,600 and $1,550 support levels to settle below the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt even spiked below the $1,500 support level and traded as low as $1,482. At the moment, it is consolidating losses around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,664 high to $1,482 low. On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near $1,580 and the 100 hourly SMA. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,664 high to $1,482 low is at $1,573 to act as a key resistance. Moreover, there is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,640 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , it seems like the price may correct higher, but it may struggle to move above $1,580 and $1,600. On the downside, $1,500 and $1,480 levels are important supports. A break below $1,480 may push the price back towards $1,450.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is now back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is near the oversold readings.\nMajor Support Level – $1,480\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,580\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Trimmed Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T08:00:49.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fa2bbfd9ef63459ab8e8ad1a66cfd5acd9ee99e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUdeK56G.tyiB9DIr8dEt3Xf5ChlMNl0WHHe8MIlSBz8k1FBem6Lm7BgbUKVjeKUVtVsgQ3Efi62uHrKjV8NORDTjqbwvZ2n.LOhcpj.NBwthcgRCVSRp8", "site_full": "sputniknews.com", "site": "sputniknews.com", "site_section": "http://sputniknews.com//export/rss2/archive/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sputnik International - Breaking News & Analysis - Radio, Photos, Videos, Infographics", "title": "Russia Probes $Billions Fraud Based on Testimony of Bitcoin Hacker - Source", "title_full": "Russia Probes $Billions Fraud Based on Testimony of Bitcoin Hacker - Source", "published": "2018-05-11T07:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/106432/98/1064329843.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1616, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 1, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fa2bbfd9ef63459ab8e8ad1a66cfd5acd9ee99e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUdeK56G.tyiB9DIr8dEt3Xf5ChlMNl0WHHe8MIlSBz8k1FBem6Lm7BgbUKVjeKUVtVsgQ3Efi62uHrKjV8NORDTjqbwvZ2n.LOhcpj.NBwthcgRCVSRp8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T07:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russia Probes $Billions Fraud Based on Testimony of Bitcoin Hacker - Source", "text": "1 3 1\nRussia has opened a criminal inquiry into confessions by Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national held in a Greek jail at a US request related to money-laundering charges, a source privy to the matter told Sputnik. \"Vinnik wrote several confession letters to Russian law enforcement agencies, pleading guilty to crimes related to financial technologies.

Sponsored Links\nIn a chat with CNBC Make It on May 9, 2018, Williams revealed that studying astrology gave him an insight into pumping his money into the cryptocurrency boom.\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” he said, adding that his reading of astrological charts led him towards investing in the world’s flagship cryptocurrency, bitcoin.\nWilliams further explained that he got hugely interested in bitcoin when he saw that planet Uranus was about venturing into Taurus and Uranus represents “revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation,” and Taurus takes care of “resources and finances.”\nAccording to Williams, the footballer turned astrologer; when we combine Uranus’ power of revolution with Taurus’ focus on wealth and finance, it means that shortly, “we’re going to change the way we view and understand” finances.\nAdditionally, Pluto is moving through Capricorn, which he explains, “represents our structures, like banks for instance,” Williams revealed, adding:\n“I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action.” A $50,000 Bitcoin Portfolio\nWith a clear vision of the future, the former athlete has invested at least $50,000 of his money into bitcoin. He also isn’t perturbed about the super volatile nature of his new portfolio. He reiterated that even if it turns out to be that he made a wrong decision about buying bitcoin, he’ll still be glad he contributed his bit to the revolution.\nIn his words:\n“Especially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning. But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.”\nWilliams is absolutely right. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shed most of the weights they gained back in 2017 due to a whole lot of fear uncertainty and doubt that has surrounded the industry.\nTo make matters worse, critics have not ceased doing what they know how to do best.\nIn the latest development, On May 8, 2018, the vice chairman of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger said that trading bitcoin is worse than “trading freshly harvested baby brains,” adding “I regard the whole business as anti-social, stupid, immoral. I regard the whole thing as a combination of dementia and immorality. I think the people pushing it are a disgrace.”\nWell, it’s a free world after all, and everyone is entitled to their opinions. Let the Mungers continue to monger while the price of bitcoin and other cryptos continue to climb.

Each bitcoin transaction costs 215 kilowatt-hours of energy.\nThe average American household USES about 901 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month, which means that each bitcoin exchange consumes enough energy to make an American family comfortable for a week.\nWhat do you think about the energy consumption of bitcoin?\nThe energy consumption bitcoin could be really expensive but I think crude oil is not the bases for its consumption in energy because there are other sources that are environmental-friendly.

Price has since pulled back to the broken support and completed the retest. The Fibonacci extension tool shows the next downside targets from here. Bitcoin price seems to be caving to bearish pressure once more as it broke below the channel and completed the retest.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. Price has also fallen below the moving averages' dynamic inflection points to confirm a pickup in selling pressure.\nHowever, RSI looks ready to pull up from oversold conditions to show that sellers are exhausted and ready to let buyers take over. Stochastic is still heading south so bitcoin price might keep following suit, but the oscillator is also dipping in oversold territory.\nSustained selling pressure could take bitcoin price to the next Fib extension level at $8750 or the 78.6% level at $8580. The full extension is located at $8359. A bit of a head and shoulders pattern can also be seen with price already trading below the neckline.\nBTCUSD 1-hour Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin wasn't off to a strong start for the week as it was dragged down by profit-taking and remarks from Warren Buffet. However, a few positive developments were still reported, such as ICE's plans to create a bitcoin exchange and another approval for the Winklevoss' bitcoin plans.\nAnalysts continue to provide bullish forecasts for bitcoin price as well, with Fundstrat estimating that it could reach $64,000 by next year. For now, it looks like risk sentiment is winning out as investors continue to cash in their positions in favor of the dollar. BTCUSD has been unable to benefit from the selloff in the dollar on weak CPI, suggesting that the pair is moving on different dynamics.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis for 05/11/2018 – Are Bears Ready to Take Over Again? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T07:30:49.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20a659007407ac7f830d568542a25b83f2c265e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcAngQ9NTr42Xg.Ob.kiGIg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "Bitcoin and eth big scam", "title_full": "Bitcoin and eth big scam", "published": "2018-05-11T07:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.234, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20a659007407ac7f830d568542a25b83f2c265e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcAngQ9NTr42Xg.Ob.kiGIg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Didin", "published": "2018-05-11T07:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin and eth big scam", "text": "What a coincidence that you better listened to Warren Buffett.\nDo you have any insider that you can share on what you should do before investing to bitcoin and eth?

Graphics chipmaker Nvidia pulled the curtain back on its bitcoin mining-related business for the first time on Thursday. But the real game-changing opportunity for Nvidia is not inside the crowded cryptocurrency minesit's in the wide open field of artificial intelligence.So says Benjamin Lau, thechief investment officer of Apriem Advisors, a firm with $650 million under management that's betting big on Nvidia.Nvidia's business designing chips for AI uses, which could upend industries from healthcare to transportation, and chips for computer data centers are the future, said Lau.\"They have a great platform and not a lot of really meaningful competition in that space,\" said Lau, whose firm is long Nvidia's stock.Nvidia is already seeing significant success in those areas. In the first quarter, its data center business brought in $701 million in revenue, which was up 71% from the year-ago period. Sales of its latest Tesla chipswhich the company designed for AI processinghelped boost the data center business, the company said.Data center sales were reportedly below analysts' estimates, which may have explained the sell-off in Nvidia's stock in after-hours trading following its report. In recent trading, Nvidia's shares were down $8.53, or 3%, to $251.60.Still, Lau was impressed with the business' performance in the period and sees it continuing to drive Nvidia's overall results.\"The AI stuff and the data center stuff is going to be the short-term boost\" for Nvidia, Lau said.The investor is also optimistic about the company's automotive efforts, although those have been mired in controversy of late. Nvidia has been developing chips and other technology for use in self-driving cars.After an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian in Arizona, Nvidia announced that it would suspend its own autonomous vehicle tests. Uber's self-driving cars use Nvidia graphics processors, but not its autonomous vehicle system.The bitcoin business is in the past, the autonomous car business is the futureNvidia's automotive business totaled $145 million in sales in the first quarter, up just 4% from the year-ago period. But it's still early days in the development of self-driving cars, Lau said.\"The auto stuff is going to be the future for them,\" he said. But he acknowledged that \"there will be speed bumps with autonomous driving.\"One area Lau isn't counting much on is cryptocurrency mining. For the first time ever, Nvidia disclosed in its earnings report its cryptocurrency-related sales, saying they hit $289 million in its first quarter.Nvidia and rival AMD have been boosted in recent years by the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. So-called miners have bought up their graphics processors to help solve the complex mathematical problems involved in creating new cybercoins.But that business appears to be waning as prices of bitcoin and other cybercurrencies have slumped, the cost involved in mining them have risen, and as miners rely increasingly on application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICS, which are chips designed for particular purposes. Nvidia itself predicted sales would slump in its second quarter, something that jibes with Lau's expectations.\"It's not going to be a driver going forward,\" he said. \"It was a nice boost while they had it.\"Nvidia's stock has soared over the last two years amid burgeoning sales and earnings. But the company's sales are still relatively small compared with other big chipmakers, such as Qualcomm and Broadcom, Lau noted.\"They have a lot of room to grow in this area,\" he said.SEE ALSO:Intel may be flying high, but it faces plenty of challenges aheadJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos: Blue Origin is 'the most important work that I'm doing", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/apriem-advisors-cio-benjamin-lau-is-bullish-on-nvidia-2018-5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "benjamin lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nvda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nvidia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apriem advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:24:43.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ccc9a35f50795b5439f51a326420c8387ed4afb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMdBjp_QOFBEX", "site_full": "www.latestnigeriannews.com", "site": "latestnigeriannews.com", "site_section": "http://www.latestnigeriannews.com/feed//rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Nigerian News Headlines", "title": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "title_full": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "published": "2018-05-11T07:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36301, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ccc9a35f50795b5439f51a326420c8387ed4afb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMdBjp_QOFBEX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T07:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "text": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos Published by Business Insider on Fri, 11 May 2018 Blockfolio, an app crypto investors can use to view their investments, has raised $3 million in funding.The money is going towards a new service that'll connect investors with the teams behind certain tokens.The company, which boosts 4 million users, is gunning to be the Bloomberg for crypto. Blockfolio, a popular platform crypto investors use to check their holdings, is aiming to be the Bloomberg for crypto.The firm, which announced Thursday the close of a $3 million in venture funding round, has taken its first big step towards its lofty vision with the launch of Signal, a new service that will allow cryptocurrency development teams to send information directly to investors on the Blockfolio app.Cryptocurrencies have development teams behind them that are working on software updates, expanding into new markets and listing on new exchanges. Signal will allow those development teams to send information, such as protocol updates or new hires, directly to investors on the Blockfolio platform. Blockfolio will then vet developers and the information they send to ensure their veracity.Typically, crypto investors rely on Telegram or Twitter for such information, but sometimes those platforms can be unreliable or false, says Blockfolio chief executive Ed Moncada.In an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Moncada said the new Signal feature will cut out misinformation, PR-hype, and bias.\"With Signal, we mainline important team information directly to users. Signals come straight from the token team leadership, free of the noise and toxicity that we so often see in the current communication channels used by the global crypto community,\" Moncada said.\"Just like how the feed is so valuable on Facebook and LinkedIn, the feed will become the center point of Blockfolio,\" Moncada added.In the long-run, Moncada sees the firm becoming a central hub of data and information for the crypto world just as Bloomberg serves such a function in the broader financial markets.\"We want to be the de facto communication network,\" Moncada said. \"The hub of breaking information.\"20 development teams are participating, including Dash, aelf, and Digibyte. Moncada said other teams have expressed interest.Participants in Blockfolio's funding round include include DCM, which previously has invested in companies such as SigFig, the fintech company. Other participants include Playground Ventures and L2 Ventures.SEE ALSO:One of the largest bitcoin hedge funds killed it in April - but it still got showed up by passive fundsJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: How socially responsible investing can help you avoid catastrophic drops within your portfolio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/a-wannabe-bloomberg-of-crypto-is-connecting-investors-directly-with-the-teams-working-on-the-hottest-tokens-2018-5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blockfolio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "signal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:40:50.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bafb3e5a6616ccd7e2926d5acd248dbcc95ff46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqars8cRPpZO6rQt4uHI4uYY67YNbiWxukVKzmJvvBB8QGD_bDwCaER9hQSE0Sjm0yNgSm6kVfLWidi_pssKDs19z2FvwP1JGd3", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is The MOST Secure Place To Put Your Money! : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is The MOST Secure Place To Put Your Money! : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-11T07:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1bafb3e5a6616ccd7e2926d5acd248dbcc95ff46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqars8cRPpZO6rQt4uHI4uYY67YNbiWxukVKzmJvvBB8QGD_bDwCaER9hQSE0Sjm0yNgSm6kVfLWidi_pssKDs19z2FvwP1JGd3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Digitallifeworks", "published": "2018-05-11T07:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is The MOST Secure Place To Put Your Money! : CryptoCurrency", "text": "submitted by /u/Digitallifeworks\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.globalcryptopress.com/2018/05/tim-draper-bitcoin-is-most-secure-place.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T04:10:53.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44f34789dec22aa724bf0c5ff807cc7478d49d5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnJ8.tXGvxODNxxC8Z5KAHEG5Clkae32Z.0Q_eoELRAoipibULRnB4v9HnTx0XaG9iBq60QCpf4WuqL4bAnhuZfVVwRBszMFCkqvt8i3t5zjI-", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Bitcoin Traders has Israel Tax Authority looking for them on Social Media", "title_full": "Bitcoin Traders has Israel Tax Authority looking for them on Social Media", "published": "2018-05-11T07:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Traders-has-Israel-Tax-Authority-looking-for-them-on-Social-Media.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44f34789dec22aa724bf0c5ff807cc7478d49d5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnJ8.tXGvxODNxxC8Z5KAHEG5Clkae32Z.0Q_eoELRAoipibULRnB4v9HnTx0XaG9iBq60QCpf4WuqL4bAnhuZfVVwRBszMFCkqvt8i3t5zjI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T07:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Traders has Israel Tax Authority looking for them on Social Media", "text": " Bitcoin Traders has Israel Tax Authority looking for them on Social Media\nTaxes\nVarious local branches of the Israel Tax Authority have sent out letters to those they suspect are trading bitcoin without reporting it.

However, this platform is not your typical crowdfunding platform, as they only use cryptocurrency Bitcoin to support startups and small businesses pitching for support on the platform.\nDrofund wants to help startups get access to the global economy investors who leverage on the cryptos. The platform officially went live last month and chose to crowdfund using cryptos because the currency transcends borders and jurisdiction. Thereby opening the doors for African startups to get funds from far and wide.\n“ We saw a huge funding gap in Africa, and as co-founders, we have previously experienced the pain of raising capital on the continent,” said Mathenge Kanyoro, a co-founder of Drofund in an interview with Disrupt Africa.\n“Accessing capital is one of the biggest challenges facing African entrepreneurs, and we believe Drofund presents a solution to this.”\nDrofund has the ambitious plan of not just sticking to playing within the Kenyan or African space, it wants to go global and head-to-head in competition with the big wigs like Kickstarter and Indiegogo.\n“ Closer to home, our African competitor is Thundafund. What sets Drofund apart from the other crowdfunding platforms is the fact that we are using Bitcoin, the digital peer-to-peer currency, as the fundraising currency.\nWhat this means is that African entrepreneurs will now be able to tap into global capital thanks to bitcoin’s ubiquitous nature.”\nDrofund will charge a 5% commission on all funds raised on its platform. The startup is also self-funded and has begun running its own crowdfunding campaign on its own platform, eyeing to nest investors from the Kenyan market. It runs from Nairobi but has plans to open up pilot offices across major cities in Africa in the future.\nDrofund, a Bitcoin-based crowdfunding platform launches in Kenya\nMilicent Atieno\nOriginal article: Drofund, a Bitcoin-based crowdfunding platform launches in Kenya .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mathenge kanyoro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drofund", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "caribbean islands & africa drofund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T07:12:44.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e81c4a88adc5f1328ef00278d3d8a543af838b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb34_YbwZjDPi7nWsZZoyV8M0LCtjsY8iT.V6HTveDmCXjn4VcMIostB2cwHpVP18Th6cNprSQxC7QqG_YDsarv7mpABkDRCpHcA--", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin Planet Market Capitalization Reaches $91,083.00 (BTPL)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Planet Market Capitalization Reaches $91,083.00 (BTPL)", "published": "2018-05-11T07:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1748.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e81c4a88adc5f1328ef00278d3d8a543af838b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb34_YbwZjDPi7nWsZZoyV8M0LCtjsY8iT.V6HTveDmCXjn4VcMIostB2cwHpVP18Th6cNprSQxC7QqG_YDsarv7mpABkDRCpHcA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-11T07:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Planet Market Capitalization Reaches $91,083.00 (BTPL)", "text": "Posted by ABMN Staff on May 10th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Planet (CURRENCY:BTPL) traded 11.7% lower against the U.S. dollar during the one day period ending at 0:00 AM E.T. on May 10th.

As of the current scenario, the price is expected to consolidate above $8,500 and we may see any strong bearish pressure as well, but as the price remains above $8,500 with a daily close, there are chances of the price moving higher towards $10,000 and later towards $11,500 in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kumo cloud", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:09:15.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b755fb5f6073be7bc1b1d39be84512086d01bd33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMudrOQOy62bX2Zwa7zPn2sVhVvFQhJdccjrxK1qjAKLBPKO.grlO8Ga08XuGzyPJ3Yi3eZTBm.twUiOjdPKnlckGuA9VQZoLXUX8f6fRVioCJLGjS1r5pwh39_du4sgvpc-", "site_full": "vidque.com", "site": "vidque.com", "site_section": "http://vidque.com/rss/videos/trending.rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Vidque / trending", "title": "Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya On Apple, Bitcoin, And The Internet | CNBC", "title_full": "Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya On Apple, Bitcoin, And The Internet | CNBC", "published": "2018-05-11T07:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://files.vidque.com/vids/4/3/4/3/0/343068.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b755fb5f6073be7bc1b1d39be84512086d01bd33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMudrOQOy62bX2Zwa7zPn2sVhVvFQhJdccjrxK1qjAKLBPKO.grlO8Ga08XuGzyPJ3Yi3eZTBm.twUiOjdPKnlckGuA9VQZoLXUX8f6fRVioCJLGjS1r5pwh39_du4sgvpc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T07:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya On Apple, Bitcoin, And The Internet | CNBC", "text": "Source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhO_FGErVvg Description: Chamath Palihapitiya, Social Capital founder and CEO, discusses his take on Apple, bitcoin, the media business and the future of the internet with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" » Subscribe to CNBC: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Worried that the process is too complicated? Well, fear not — trading bitcoin couldn't be any easier. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make your first bitcoin trade using SimpleFX.\nGetting Registered First and foremost, you will need an account to start trading on SimpleFX — and creating one is a simple process.\nSimply head on over to SimpleFX.com and click the green \"CREATE ACCOUNT\" button on the top right-hand side of the screen.\nYou may create a SimpleFX account using your Facebook or Google accounts, or use an existing email. Afterward, you will need to check your email address to complete the steps required for verification and the transfer of funds.\nOnce you've completed these initial registration steps, you'll be ready to start trading!\nMake Your Move First, you will need to select your desired market from the left-hand side. For this guide, let's assume you would like to start by trading Bitcoin.\nAfter clicking BTCUSD, you will need to choose a side — buy or sell. If you've already deposited bitcoin or another cryptocurrency into your wallet, you will be able to open buy or sell position (hopefully for a profit).\nHowever, let's assume this is your first ever bitcoin trade. In this case, we're obviously looking to buy\nYou will also want to choose between a market order — an order which is filled immediately at the current market price — or a pending order. With the latter order type, you choose the price you'd like to buy-in at, and the order will fill if and when that price is met.\nFor example, if the current buy price is 9399.04 USD, and you think the price of bitcoin will drop to 9200 USD, you may place a pending order at 9200 USD — which will fill if bitcoin market price will reach that level.\nNext, you simply need to choose the size of your order. You may purchase position worth whole bitcoins or fractions of bitcoins.\nThe trade value, required margin, and point value are all displayed for your convenience below the trade side box. Simply click the plus or minus buttons to increase or decrease your desired purchase amount.\nOnce you've selected how big position you would like to open, you may set prices for both profit taking and loss prevention.\n\"Take Profit\" is the price at which you would like to sell your bitcoin for a profit. For example, if you think Bitcoin will meet strong resistance at 10,000 USD, you may set an order to take profit at that price — in the hopes of possibly buying back in when it retraces.\nStop losses, on the other hand, may be set to minimize losses if the market should suddenly take an unexpected downturn. Many traders find these crucial, as it helps prevent large-scale losses in times of volatility and uncertainty.\nFinally, all that's left to do is click buy!\nOf course, the process works exactly the same in reverse, should you be looking to sell.\nThat's all there is to it. Now get out there and start making some money!\nWhat do you think of SimpleFX's easy platform for bitcoin trading ? Do you use SimpleFX?

Galaxy Digital LP has struck a strategic partnership deal with Bloomberg to create a cryptocurrency index called the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI).\nIn the May 9 announcement, the firms have stated that the all-new Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index would “track the performance” of ten established and most liquid cryptos on the market, including bitcoin, ethereum, EOS, monero, and ripple. Bitcoin and Ethereum are equally weighted at 30 percent, with the index’s methodology not allowing for a weighting higher than 30 percent. Displayed below are the weightings for other cryptocurrencies: Sponsored Links Source: Bloomberg\nFurther explaining how the platform works, the statement hinted that all the digital assets that make up the index are diversified across a vast array of categories such as mediums of exchange, smart contract protocols, stores of value and fungible assets.\nThe companies also reiterated that the digital currency index makes use of a rules-based system as well as data from reliable sources that have passed through the BGCI “due diligence processes.” Digital Currencies Steadily Going Mainstream\nWhile Bloomberg runs other indices in the traditional finance industry including indices for strategy, commodities, and many others, the BGCI is a first-of-its-kind index for the digital currency ecosystem.\nButtressing the above fact, the firms said that:\n“The creation of the index marks an important step in the evolution of the digital assets space, facilitating diversified exposure as well as independent benchmarking for investors.”\nOf a truth, services like the BGCI is what the virtual currency space needs in order to make valuable information about the nascent industry more readily available to investors who may need such data to make informed investment decisions.\n“The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index brings unprecedented transparency to the cryptomarkets. We are excited to help drive the decentralized revolution forward through the creation of BGCI,” said Michael Novogratz, CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital Capital Management.\nSteve Kurz, Head of Asset Management at Galaxy Digital Capital Management also noted that, “We are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index’s independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature.” Better Days Ahead\nNovogratz initially had plans of launching his cryptocurrency hedge fund on December 15, 2017. However, the smart billionaire shelved the move amidst fears of a market slump.\n“We didn’t like market conditions, and we wanted to re-evaluate what we’re doing. I look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now,” he told Bloomberg back in December 2017, adding “I didn’t want to have to deal with the schizophrenic emotional side of it. There are just so many conflicts in that business. It was going to be more complicated than I wanted.”\nWhen Novogratz announced he was no longer interested in launching a bitcoin hedge fund last year, many thought the former Goldman Sachs man had lost faith in digital currencies. However, the expert asset manager quickly re-strategized and steered his ship to a less stormy sea.\nIn February 2018, reports emerged that Novogratz had raised $250 million for his cryptocurrency merchant bank in a private funding round. With a war chest of over $250 million and several formidable partnerships, it remains to be seen whether he will succeed this time around.

Do your due diligence before investing in anything.\nI may have missed the crypto bloom, being the last person in town to ride the boat. My involvement in bitcoin started just because I want to collect a free $10 from Coinbase (so kiasu) . And if anyone likes to send me free bitcoins, I have an address to receive. In the process, I found that cryptocurrencies are not as scary as I think. It takes just two steps and twenty minutes to set things up. Where have I been all this while?\nFirst, you have to create a wallet. A wallet is like a bank account where store the coins. Each wallet comes with a number and a key. The public bitcoin address is your account number to deposit money while the private bitcoin key allows you to transfer the money. Like your atm card pin, the private key should be kept secret.\nThere are three types of wallet: A cloud-based, paper and hardware.\nPaper wallet: I opt for the paper wallet because it's safer than cloud-based and it's free. This is the wallet that I use if I decide to store the coins for the long run. You could generate a wallet from an open source like WalletGenerator .\nCloud-based wallet: You could have multiple bitcoin addresses for a different purpose. My wallet at Wirex is like a current account to me. Here I store a smaller amount of coins for the daily transactions. It's a cloud-based address, and the security depends very much on the company. If you are a UK citizen, Wirex is one of the best crypto debit card provider.\nHardware wallet: If you like to invest in the best option, you could buy hardware wallet (USB like password device) like Ledger Nano S. Make sure you got the original Ledger.\nHardware wallet requires you to plug in the USB device to transfer out any coins in a wallet.\nSecond, the exchange platform You will need exchange provider if you want to buy or trade your bitcoin into other cryptocurrency or convert to cash. Like a bank provider, these exchange charges fees for transactions.\nThe most widely used platform in Malaysia is probably Luno and Localbitcoins . However, there are incidents where the government freeze Luno accounts in Malaysia. Coinbase is an alternative if you have VPN because the service is not available to Malaysia. The problem with most exchange platform is 1. History record of being hacked. 2. The clearance takes x-days on a volatile market.\nAll these platforms will give you a bitcoin address like a wallet, but try not to keep them inside for more than a week. I personally only use these platform to sell coins and transfer to a bank.\nCoin Mining If you are more interested in mining bitcoin, consider HashFlare . All my bitcoin are mined here. Mining is cheaper than buying a coin and lower in initial investment.\nThe risk of using paid mining service is you may not get any bitcoin if the mining company are fraud. I have only invested $9.90, and I have got my returns. It is more of an experiment than a real financial gain. Invest at your own risk.\nConclusion\nNo one knows for sure where cryptocurrency will be heading. I am in view that as long as people accept your coin for their service, there will be some value peg to the currencies, just like any other fiat money.
