Will bitcoin price surge once again during the event as it has in previous three years? RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BITCOIN PRICE AND CONSENSUS\nA look at the previous three Consensus Conferences shows significant crypto price movements during and immediately after. This trend has been maintained in all three conferences so far.\nThus, it stands to reason that the pattern could continue in 2018. Blockchain conferences create a lot of hype and buzz. Traders are less likely to sell during the duration of these important crypto gatherings as important announcements are expected.\nIn 2015, bitcoin prices increased by 23 percent during the conference and continued on a 121 percent rally in the two months that followed. About 500 people attended the 2015 gathering, which took place on September 10.\nThe following year, the attendance tripled to 1,500. Bitcoin prices increased by 10 percent during the Consensus week and 78 percent in the following two months. Then in 2017, attendance doubled. At the same time, Bitcoin price spiked by 69 percent at the time and 138 percent in the following two months.\nThe 2018 event is expected to have triple the attendance of last year with over 7,000 people expected at the conference. If the historical trend holds, bitcoin prices could grow by at least 50 percent during the conference and a further 100 percent rally till the start of summer.\nThis means bitcoin price could break the $10,000 mark this week and approach $16,000 by July. Though these figures are still shy of Tom Lee’s $20,000 mid-year bitcoin price prediction .\nAltcoin prices have also had spectacular rallies during and after previous Consensus Conferences as they tend to follow Bitcoin. In 2017, the average altcoin price increase during the meeting was 176 percent while mean prices spiked by 552 percent in the two months that followed. POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS\nHistorical figures are a vital analysis tool in the crypto market. However, the nascent nature of the industry makes it difficult to rely solely on these figures to establish a pattern.\nIt will be interesting to if the pattern holds as the situation in 2018 is a lot different from previous years with this year’s record attendance and unprecedented global attention.\nThis year has also seen an increase in regulatory oversight measures from government and financial regulators. Meanwhile, negative rhetoric from naysayers like Warren Buffett , Bill Gates , Charlie Munger, etc., has particularly been in the news as of late, while South Korea appears to be widening its probe on crypto exchanges in the country.\nCrypto enthusiasts and traders, however, will have their fingers crossed hoping for history to repeat itself. The market waits with bated breath to see what becomes of it as Consensus begins.\nWill history repeat itself causing a bitcoin price rally during and after the Consensus Summit? Let us know in the comment section below.\nImage courtesy of Twitter @Super_Crypto, Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-a-watched-pot-never-boils/", "http://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-consensus-conference-will-trigger-bitcoin-price-increase/", "http://bitcoinist.com/warren-buffett-calls-bitcoin-rat-poison-ignores-real-world-utility/", "http://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-strategist-bitcoin-is-still-bullish-will-hit-25k-by-year-end/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/", "http://bitcoinist.com/south-korean-authorities-raid-three-cryptocurrency-exchanges/", "http://bitcoinist.com/bill-gates-i-agree-i-would-short-it-if-there-was-an-easy-way-to-do-it/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "consensus conferences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:13:56.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fa5594c9315a99b7d484064cf355e6e35b4067c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuJaddLNHX3AJvy2rIZr.gQqWtf.Q.TXLEbaSSxkI9wSB.jstMGLYUsQiy3YFqQZAzQlRgKGsDM8yCKKtWMR1JxsxCHbRbGlWXrR2lmo4O2ha7YwOX3_2y2GsoCxp3CgG53ng7xmdmfGs-", "site_full": "www.benzinga.com", "site": "benzinga.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.benzinga.com/benzinga/news/m-a", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "M&amp;A", "title": "TimeFireVR Provides Update on Bitcoin Mining Operation and Expansion Strategy", "title_full": "TimeFireVR Provides Update on Bitcoin Mining Operation and Expansion Strategy", "published": "2018-05-14T16:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23263, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9fa5594c9315a99b7d484064cf355e6e35b4067c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuJaddLNHX3AJvy2rIZr.gQqWtf.Q.TXLEbaSSxkI9wSB.jstMGLYUsQiy3YFqQZAzQlRgKGsDM8yCKKtWMR1JxsxCHbRbGlWXrR2lmo4O2ha7YwOX3_2y2GsoCxp3CgG53ng7xmdmfGs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Globe Newswire", "published": "2018-05-14T16:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "TimeFireVR Provides Update on Bitcoin Mining Operation and Expansion Strategy", "text": "May 14, 2018 9:01am Comments Share: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TimefireVR, Inc.

Will bitcoin price surge once again during the event as it has in previous three years? RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BITCOIN PRICE AND CONSENSUS\nA look at the previous three Consensus Conferences shows significant crypto price movements during and immediately after. This trend has been maintained in all three conferences so far.\nThus, it stands to reason that the pattern could continue in 2018. Blockchain conferences create a lot of hype and buzz. Traders are less likely to sell during the duration of these important crypto gatherings as important announcements are expected.\nIn 2015, bitcoin prices increased by 23 percent during the conference and continued on a 121 percent rally in the two months that followed. About 500 people attended the 2015 gathering, which took place on September 10.\nThe following year, the attendance tripled to 1,500. Bitcoin prices increased by 10 percent during the Consensus week and 78 percent in the following two months. Then in 2017, attendance doubled. At the same time, Bitcoin price spiked by 69 percent at the time and 138 percent in the following two months.\nThe 2018 event is expected to have triple the attendance of last year with over 7,000 people expected at the conference. If the historical trend holds, bitcoin prices could grow by at least 50 percent during the conference and a further 100 percent rally till the start of summer.\nThis means bitcoin price could break the $10,000 mark this week and approach $16,000 by July. Though these figures are still shy of Tom Lee’s $20,000 mid-year bitcoin price prediction .\nAltcoin prices have also had spectacular rallies during and after previous Consensus Conferences as they tend to follow Bitcoin. In 2017, the average altcoin price increase during the meeting was 176 percent while mean prices spiked by 552 percent in the two months that followed. POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS\nHistorical figures are a vital analysis tool in the crypto market. However, the nascent nature of the industry makes it difficult to rely solely on these figures to establish a pattern.\nIt will be interesting to if the pattern holds as the situation in 2018 is a lot different from previous years with this year’s record attendance and unprecedented global attention.\nThis year has also seen an increase in regulatory oversight measures from government and financial regulators. Meanwhile, negative rhetoric from naysayers like Warren Buffett , Bill Gates , Charlie Munger, etc., has particularly been in the news as of late, while South Korea appears to be widening its probe on crypto exchanges in the country.\nCrypto enthusiasts and traders, however, will have their fingers crossed hoping for history to repeat itself. The market waits with bated breath to see what becomes of it as Consensus begins.\nWill history repeat itself causing a bitcoin price rally during and after the Consensus Summit? Let us know in the comment section below.\nImage courtesy of Twitter @Super_Crypto, Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-a-watched-pot-never-boils/", "http://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-consensus-conference-will-trigger-bitcoin-price-increase/", "http://bitcoinist.com/warren-buffett-calls-bitcoin-rat-poison-ignores-real-world-utility/", "http://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-strategist-bitcoin-is-still-bullish-will-hit-25k-by-year-end/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/", "http://bitcoinist.com/south-korean-authorities-raid-three-cryptocurrency-exchanges/", "http://bitcoinist.com/bill-gates-i-agree-i-would-short-it-if-there-was-an-easy-way-to-do-it/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "consensus conferences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:31:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a7348d21e3a6806a8f16669042cfcfc8ea885f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQLaZAXBJY1YZAxEsnvy7.U-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "title_full": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "published": "2018-05-14T15:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a7348d21e3a6806a8f16669042cfcfc8ea885f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQLaZAXBJY1YZAxEsnvy7.U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yohr87", "published": "2018-05-14T15:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "text": "Quote: from: SUDARMONO on March 24, 2018, 11:15:43 PM After we look at bitcoin developments from the beginning to the present, I also believe that even now the price is down but someday the price will surely blow up again, I believe bitcoin will rise again quickly.\nDont loose hope because it will rise again.We all know that the price of bitcoin is not stable.Lets continue to be strong with bitcoin so that it become the future coins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T12:07:40.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82d6964bdd6f30b21489361f1ed90b2f80b280cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wdj06lxkz_jU0TrtTZ.AcLRwOXYT82BGHcNZRmJfEng0o0v9dLf17RvJ5tXI2zBGTjNfEvVtui4.RNOxSwcVnsgHktVsnaRikOC5QCVkVtdSg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "reddit: the front page of the internet", "title": "What's the best crypto exchange app in Nigeria?

Citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, senior reporter Alex Heath said that the company — whose $533 billion market cap is a $140 billion larger than the current cryptocurrency market cap — is holding serious, high-level discussions about directing the focus of its blockchain research team toward releasing its own cryptocurrency. Heath said: “Sources say that Facebook is specifically interested in creating its own digital token, which would allow its more than two billion users to facilitate transactions without government-backed currency. Facebook is also looking at other ways that it could use this core blockchain technology that underpins these popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.” He added that the company is also evaluating how it can use blockchain technology to improve identity verification and secure its backend infrastructure — perhaps even including how it manages customer data. As CCN reported , Facebook announced last week that it had created a new team dedicated to researching blockchain technology. That team is led by Facebook executive David Marcus, who is also a sitting member of the Coinbase board of directors. Cheddar ✔ @cheddar SCOOP: Facebook is exploring the creation of its own cryptocurrency to facilitate digital payments for its two billion users.\nCheddar senior reporter @ alexeheath has all the details. # CheddarScoops # CheddarLIVE\n10:41 PM - May 11, 2018 197 182 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy Marcus, who formerly served as president of PayPal , is an outspoken advocate for cryptocurrencies, and his experience at the digital payments firm makes him an ideal choice to oversee Facebook’s potential foray into this space. The venture would likely see Facebook make “strategic acquisitions” in the cryptocurrency industry as it seeks to build out its blockchain infrastructure. Discussions are still preliminary, and if Facebook does decide to issue its own cryptocurrency it will likely be “years away.” Facebook would not be the only social media platform to launch its own cryptocurrency. Telegram says that it has raised $1.7 billion through an initial coin offering (ICO) to launch a “ third-generation blockchain ” called the Telegram Open Network, while chat app Kik is creating a blockchain token called Kin .\nFacebook, Heath said, does not currently plan to hold an ICO, both because the company has billions of dollars on its balance sheet and because selling the token could have negative repercussions on the firm’s already-battered reputation. Instead, the firm may airdrop the coins to its users or reward it to them in some other manner. https://www.ccn.com/facebook-may-issue-its-own-cryptocurrency-report/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex heath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heath", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:36:46.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f507f6f39c916566b963c303dc748fab3315f71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaRzV_925kPMVQbI3GiDargIvk8cjsN7Xkd5n0qpHS.bsovsNJQdVP3A2ub8ulNDl1BXBUrhP8Zeev8EwdEo2ynpqfYR2FOAjX", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female", "title_full": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-14T15:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f507f6f39c916566b963c303dc748fab3315f71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaRzV_925kPMVQbI3GiDargIvk8cjsN7Xkd5n0qpHS.bsovsNJQdVP3A2ub8ulNDl1BXBUrhP8Zeev8EwdEo2ynpqfYR2FOAjX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "matroya", "published": "2018-05-14T15:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female", "text": "submitted by /u/matroya\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wetalkcoins.com/news/only-85-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-traders-are-female"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T10:54:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "832f90eee6165b8aaa0ae51fbc9b33499153f483", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRhTiR3heEwuaLlDoJF89eOZ4lbpdsYjLg0uHsfDkp2TAU12cQBos.0k56AeR.PlvkU3UNcsTinmUex76ST0cyojx1LkzA6LTaRHTT.lIIyGY221RZjar_GPEsU6bi5a_HA7q5R5aPFVk8wSR7F_ysfVsZEX02byPM-", "site_full": "sellbitbuy.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://sellbitbuy.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Liquidity cum local bitcoin clone script | Exchange trade order book | PHP script – Sellbitbuy -Bitcoin Exchange website script& Escrow Solution", "title": "Liquidity cum local bitcoin clone script | Exchange trade order book | PHP script", "title_full": "Liquidity cum local bitcoin clone script | Exchange trade order book | PHP script", "published": "2018-05-14T15:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "832f90eee6165b8aaa0ae51fbc9b33499153f483", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRhTiR3heEwuaLlDoJF89eOZ4lbpdsYjLg0uHsfDkp2TAU12cQBos.0k56AeR.PlvkU3UNcsTinmUex76ST0cyojx1LkzA6LTaRHTT.lIIyGY221RZjar_GPEsU6bi5a_HA7q5R5aPFVk8wSR7F_ysfVsZEX02byPM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Exchange & escrow script provider", "published": "2018-05-14T15:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Liquidity cum local bitcoin clone script | Exchange trade order book | PHP script", "text": "As a startup, the Bitcoin exchange will don’t have the transaction data.

Beller was the only Facebook employee devoted to studying blockchain, the digital and decentralized ledger that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum .\nReportedly, Beller’s work was thrust into the spotlight this week when Facebook announced that the vice president in charge of the Messenger app, David Marcus, would lead a new team to “explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.”\nThe trading in crypto market has been quite buoyant since the start of 2018, especially Bitcoin who dominates the segment. Bitcoin jumped nearly $20,000-historical mark last year, which led to stir up performance in other cryptocurrencies. However, 2018 came and Bitcoin started witnessing bubble and the reaction of its tumble was also seen in other virtual currencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and many more.\nNow the current situation is such that crypto market is improving. In last 24 hours, Ether and EOS surged over 5%, whereas tokens like Ontology (ONT), Storm (STORM), and Tron (TRX) demonstrated gains in the range of 10 to 15%.\nA CNN report added, tokens like ONT, TRX, Storm, 0x (ZRX), WanChain (WAN), and ICON (ICX), which have seen a two-fold increase against bitcoin on average since early April, fell by more than 15% against bitcoin.\nAs per the reports, if bitcoin continues to climb to the $9,000 mark, which is likely given the 4 percent increase in the price of bitcoin over the past 24 hours, tokens like ONT, ZRX, TRX, and STORM are expected to record relatively large gains in the short-term.\nAccording to Coindesk data, Bitcoin in USD have surged by 1.25% on Sunday at $8,572.93. The coin has given away gains in heavy amount, but has managed to float between $8,000 to $9,000 for past few weeks.\nComing back to Facebook’s love for crypto, it is stated that, the move can take years to materialize.\nPeople familiar with the matter explained in the Cheddar report that, social network doesn’t have plans to hold a so-called initial coin offering (ICO) by offering a limited number of virtual tokens for the public to buy at a set price.\nAlso Facebook will likely need to make acquisitions in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space to develop its own virtual currency.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 18.9392. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 3 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 47.28. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 29 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -183.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a sell 4 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed down -743.677 at 8,579.900.

cryptocurrency exchange BL3P has announced it will remove Bitcoin Cash by May 15.\nB3LP: Hard Fork Was 'Reason' To Boot BCH In a blog post May 10, the exchange said that it had been \"planning\" to stop supporting the altcoin, but that its upcoming hard fork had provided \"a reason\" to complete the process.\n\"Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash the hardfork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P,\" the blog post reads.\nBitcoin Cash had generated significant publicity, both positive and negative , when it announced its hard fork plans which are due to go ahead May 15.\nThe latest step in developers' plans to increase network transaction handling capabilities, prices increased over recent weeks as holders appeared to prepare for an airdrop of coins on the new chain.\nNonetheless, volatility in BCH markets remains higher than that of Bitcoin, the fluctuating considerably as Bitcoin prices fell over the weekend.\nFailing To Meet Requirements Referring to Bitcoin Cash variously as \"Bitcash\" and \"BCash,\" BL3P appeared to have little remorse over shutting down its operations and requiring users to withdraw their holdings.\n\"BL3P maintains a strict selection policy when it comes to support for altcoins, bitcash unfortunately does not meet these requirements,\" the blog post continues.\nFor this reason we have not made it possible to trade bitcash on BL3P. In addition, we will disable the option to withdraw bitcash per 15 May, 2018.\nThe move follows Hong Kong exchange OKEx , which also confirmed it would halt Bitcoin Cash support in April ostensibly due to \"inadequate liquidity.\"\nBitcoin Cash originally came into being in August 2017 as a hard fork of the Bitcoin network. At the time, proponents claimed the altcoin's bigger block size would allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\nWhat do you think about BL3P's decision to remove Bitcoin Cash?

As such, most blockchain projects consider scalability as the main long-term challenge that needs to be improved as it is not possible to process hundreds of thousands of private transactions on a daily basis.\nEvery day, the Bitcoin blockchain network processes about 162,000 transactions according to wallet platform Blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain protocol settles more than 800,000 transactions. At their peaks, Bitcoin and Ethereum processed 450,000 and 1.2 million transactions respectively.\nHowever, private blockchain networks like Monero or Zcash are not able to match the transaction volume of Bitcoin or Ethereum, primarily because private transactions require more information to be processed by public blockchain protocols. Monero currently processes approximately 5,000 transactions per day, while the figure for zcash is around 7,000.\nAt the Genesis London blockchain conference held during February 2018, Zcash COO Jack Gavigan stated that scalability has been the focus of most blockchain networks as with the current structure of blockchain protocols, it is difficult to process high volumes of anonymous transactions:\n\"I think we definitely see scaling as a challenge to be overcome. We are iterating the technology and we're improving on the technology and we – scaling and improving the ability to have high volumes of transactions on the blockchain is one of the key areas that we're focused on. I think it's a challenge that most blockchain solutions face.\"\nBulletproofs and Anonymous Payments On the Bitcoin network, it is possible to process private transactions through a solution known as Confidential Transactions (CT). But, as Gibson explained on the Cypherpunks 101 podcast if the Bitcoin blockchain network begins to process private transactions, the size of its blocks could rise by two orders of magnitude.\n\"If you do Confidential Transactions and you make the amounts [of bitcoin transactions] private, then suddenly it's huge. Bulletproofs bring [the size of transactions] way down. Not as small as original but it is much much better,\" said Gibson, explaining that private transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain network can be manageable with bulletproofs.\n\"Bulletproofs is just like an add onto the internal and technical stuff inside Confidential Transactions to make it take up less space,\" Gibson added. \"Bulletproofs are an example of zero-knowledge proofs, where the idea is somehow prove something in a really clever way that it doesn't reveal any additional data.\"\nIn February 2018, Blockchain development firm Blockstream's resident mathematician Andrew Poelstra revealed Blockstream's research into Bulletproofs , a technology which he created with Bitcoin developers Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.\nThe official report of Blockstream on Bulletproofs disclosed that similar to the core technology of the Zcash blockchain network; Bulletproofs are based on zero-knowledge proofs that allow users to send and receive payments without disclosing the amounts and any data about the recipient and sender.\nAccording to Poelstra, it was extremely inefficient for the Bitcoin protocol to process default Confidential Transactions because they were very large and slow to confirm. Each Confidential Transaction required the possession of a range proof, an element that is crucial to ensure a transaction to remain anonymous.\n\"A major difficulty with CT was that it made the transactions very large and slow to verify because it required each transaction output to contain a range proof, a type of zero-knowledge proof that proves amounts are too small to overflow,\" said Poelstra. He added that bulletproofs allow the network to implement range proofs and process Confidential Transactions more efficiently.\n\"This lets us implement things such as rangeproofs in this general zero-knowledge framework without implementing the heavy machinery of elliptic curve arithmetic in zero knowledge.\"\nOverall, the Blockstream research found that bulletproofs can help process Confidential Transactions 23 times faster.\nThe technique is not limited to just bitcoin and altcoins that share the same codebase such as litecoin and zcash; for instance, the Monero project is currently seeking donations to audit bulletproofs to ensure they are ready to be implemented.\nThe post Bulletproofs can Help Bitcoin to Process Anonymous Payments Efficiently Says Developer appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adam gibson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:54:45.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a48576eec75731a857851f289d4c62ae3541d07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywum.GWBkfWyoGni4DRODM1zytsHwd6d3Fsdlxzz0U13CWjI_RE7rHpA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms, Plot to Kill Vinnik Uncovered in Greece", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms, Plot to Kill Vinnik Uncovered in Greece", "published": "2018-05-14T14:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a48576eec75731a857851f289d4c62ae3541d07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywum.GWBkfWyoGni4DRODM1zytsHwd6d3Fsdlxzz0U13CWjI_RE7rHpA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T14:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms, Plot to Kill Vinnik Uncovered in Greece", "text": "In Monday's Bitcoin in Brief, Belgium's financial watchdog, which earlier this year published a warning about potentially fraudulent platforms promising fast and easy profits to crypto investors, has just expanded its blacklist. In Russia, reports have surfaced of a plot to assassinate Alexander Vinnik in Greece, where he fights an extradition request from US authorities accusing him of laundering billions of dollars, including funds from the hacked Mt. Gox. Elsewhere, Australia allocates budget for blockchain research, and Dubai-based exchange Bitoasis suspends dirham withdrawals.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Ghost Scares Markets, Facebook Mulls Coin\nBelgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority has expanded its list of unauthorized and potentially fraudulent crypto companies operating in the country. The financial watchdog has recently published a new warning noting that \"the FSMA is receiving an increasing number of consumer complaints regarding investments in cryptocurrencies [and] once again warns the public about these platforms, often operated by fraudsters who are now resorting to cryptocurrencies to swindle consumers.\" The regulator also said that people who have invested through these platforms often complain they never recover their funds.\nIn March, the FSMA published its first list of 19 suspicious crypto platforms saying it had received \"questions or complaints from consumers and has established indications of fraud,\" as news.Bitcoin.com reported . The agency stressed that the compilation does not include all questionable crypto trading platforms, but only those whose fraudulent practices have been reported by consumers. Last week the Belgian financial authority reminded investors that these companies usually claim to offer the best trading platforms for both beginners and professionals.\nPlot to Assassinate Vinnik Uncovered in Greece Law enforcement authorities in Greece have reportedly uncovered a plot to kill Alexander Vinnik in jail. The Russian national was detained in Greece at the request of the United States on suspicions of money laundering in connection with the Mt. Gox hack. \"Greek law enforcement received intelligence on plans to prepare an assassination via poisoning with the help of criminals. The head of the prison and the prosecutor of the city of Thessaloniki have summoned Vinnik and informed him about the plot. Special security measures were taken in connection with that,\" a source familiar with the details told Sputnik .\nAccording to the report, Vinnik is not allowed to accept any items, including food or beverages, from people he doesn't know. His contacts with other inmates have been limited and measures have been taken to improve his personal security. Greek police received information about the murder plot earlier this year but it was not made public in order to help the investigation. The presumed murder attempt is said to be linked to the criminal underground and not the special services of any country. According to the quoted source, the assassination has been ordered by someone in Russia. Vinnik has recently expressed readiness to testify to Russian authorities for fintech-related crimes in his home country.\nAlexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in July last year at the request of authorities in the US, where he is suspected of laundering between $4 and $9 billion dollars through the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e , including funds obtained from the notoriously hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox . Russia has also asked for his extradition on other charges and Vinnik himself prefers to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in Moscow. The Russian IT specialist has also filed a petition for political asylum in Greece hoping to avoid extradition to the United States.\nAustralia to Finance Blockchain Research Through Budget Australian authorities intend to finance the research of blockchain technologies through the federal budget for 2018/2019. According to the annual budget report, the government will provide additional $0.7 million AUD (>$0.5 million USD) for the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) which will be tasked to investigate areas where blockchain technology could offer the most value for government services. The agency is expected to use the funds to conduct \"research to determine the current maturity of blockchain, assess the readiness for government to adopt the technology, and identify problems that blockchain might be able to solve,\" and also, to \"understand the potential of using blockchain to support government services.\"\nSet up in 2015, DTA aims to facilitate the digitization of the Australian government. The agency has received a total of $92.4 million AUD (almost $70 million USD) in this year's budget. That means the funds allocated for blockchain research are less than 1%. Nevertheless, the country has already recognized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and passed legislation that treats cryptos like fiat money in the context of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policies. In April, Australia introduced regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. The country's financial regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has taken measures against \"deceptive and misleading initial coin offerings.\"\nDubai Exchange Bitoasis Suspends Dirham Withdrawals Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. The trading platform warned its customers that if they want to access their dirham balances or deposit dirhams into in their accounts via wire transfers they will have to initiate an order no later than Tuesday, May 15. Such transactions will not be processed after that date. According to the notice sent to account holders, credit card deposits will be possible until June 16.\nIn the letter, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis claims the restrictions were imposed due to issues with the bank it works with. Other means of buying and selling cryptocurrencies on the platform, as well as digital coin withdrawals to other wallets, are not affected, the exchange noted. \"If you decide to leave your fiat balances, the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15 would be to convert them to cryptocurrency and send them to an external wallet,\" the statement reads. Bitoasis warns clients that it cannot provide a specific date for reactivating AED fiat withdrawals.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's Bitcoin in Brief stories?

Bitcoin Struggle at $8,500 The bitcoin price has struggled to surpass the $8,500 mark on throughout May 14, even after surpassing $8,700 on May 13. The market started to recover as the bitcoin price rebounded to the $8,500 and tokens like Ontology (ONT) recorded gains in the 20 to 30 percent region, but the market failed to sustain momentum at the $400 billion mark. In an interview with The Express, cryptocurrency analyst and researcher Matthew Newton stated that major banks have already invested heavily in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, and the entire cryptocurrency market, echoing a similar stance as Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at $364 billion investment firm Federated Investors. In the short to mid-term, Newton emphasized that the entrance of banks could trigger institutional demand for cryptocurrency to rise, allowing the market to recover to its previous levels. “Despite some initial posturing, the reality is most big banks have already invested significant amounts in research and development into blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies themselves. It will still take time for institutional investors to fully come around – and the fact that Goldman won’t be buying or selling actual coins suggest some scepticism remains – but there’s a growing acceptance that these assets are here to stay,” said Newton. Many traders believe that the Blockchain Week in New York marked by the start of Consensus 2018 will help the bitcoin price recover and the market to rebound. Over the past week, the market has not been able to record any major movement on the upside and if the bitcoin price remains below the $8,500 mark, it is likely that other major cryptocurrencies and tokens will continue to slump throughout the week. But, if bitcoin can secure the $8,800 support level and eye a move towards $9,500 by the end of the week, the cryptocurrency market could experience a surge in volume and inflow of new capital. Already, the volume of the market has increased to around $21 billion, up by more than $5 billion since May 11. Depending on the volume, the bitcoin price could regain momentum and move towards the $8,800 mark or test the $8,000 resistance level in the short-term. Tokens Several tokens such as Salt, Ontology, and Storm have been able to record major gains against both bitcoin and US dollar over the past week. Considering that tokens experience intensified movements on both the upside and downside, the value of most tokens will depend on the short-term trend of bitcoin and Ethereum.\nWith the bitcoin dominance index below 37 percent, it is evident that tokens and other small cryptocurrencies have started to outperform major digital assets. As the market conditions improve in the upcoming days, tokens like Ontology, Storm, and EOS that have strong volumes on major exchanges like Binance will likely perform well against bitcoin. https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-market-drops-9-billion-bitcoin-and-major-currencies-remain-volatile/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve chiavarone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew newton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federated investors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:51:08.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8026935da89501aa56d2525aefe10296e8db9baa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdTxI5u9DDw8.n5d2SNwquHl3Su6yiq.1tSS0Mmjdphv.Hj0hZ55qUFfuuu9uf646E_w--", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "JOIN ME AND LET S GROW OUR BITCOIN WALLETS", "title_full": "JOIN ME AND LET S GROW OUR BITCOIN WALLETS", "published": "2018-05-14T14:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8026935da89501aa56d2525aefe10296e8db9baa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdTxI5u9DDw8.n5d2SNwquHl3Su6yiq.1tSS0Mmjdphv.Hj0hZ55qUFfuuu9uf646E_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "earn money (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T14:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "JOIN ME AND LET S GROW OUR BITCOIN WALLETS", "text": "This ad is from a PRO or GOLD HERCULIST member.

In other words, you multiply the market price of 1 share by the number of outstanding shares, and there you have it, that is the market cap. The number of shares is not static and it goes up if that company issues new shares so as to raise capital.\nWhat about cryptocurrencies? Well, the same principle applies. You multiply the market price of one coin by the number of coins in circulation, you have just calculated the market cap of that cryptocurrency. Just like stocks, the number of circulation is not static, and as new coins are mined, and it goes up.\nIs the market cap a useful indicator? Sure, it definitely has its limitations, and it does not tell us how much a company is actually worth. If someone sells 10% of a company's shares. then the share price would crash. But with cryptocurrencies, this principle applies even more so, as there for the most part, a lot less liquid than stocks.\nLet us assume that John forms a cryptocurrency called JohnCoin which initially has 10 million coins in circulation. Unfortunately, nobody cares except for his wife, who buys one JohnCoin from him at $1,000 thereby establishing the market price. Multiply the $1,000 by the 10 million coins in circulation, and you get a market cap of 10 billion dollars for JohnCoin, which would of course to be ridiculously unrealistic.\nAs a general rule, it is safe to say that the less liquid shares or cryptocurrencies are, the less relevant the market cap should be considered.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Cryptocurrency , market capitalization , one minute\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:30:51.062+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b28361550a70c6cc848e8a40e193e989b1a9f9da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0SbfjXsfL8XmrKGP4bqTjLbFD48COBnsWAfJIa3qwgnXWlrPiQAax6IQixFYRlL13cU0HCc_NR.Yw--", "site_full": "wahabali786.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://wahabali786.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tips and Tricks About Computer And More", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms, Plot to Kill Vinnik Uncovered in Greece", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms, Plot to Kill Vinnik Uncovered in Greece", "published": "2018-05-14T14:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b28361550a70c6cc848e8a40e193e989b1a9f9da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0SbfjXsfL8XmrKGP4bqTjLbFD48COBnsWAfJIa3qwgnXWlrPiQAax6IQixFYRlL13cU0HCc_NR.Yw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OS Tech Tips (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T14:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms, Plot to Kill Vinnik Uncovered in Greece", "text": "In Monday’s Bitcoin in Brief, Belgium’s financial watchdog, which earlier this year published a warning about potentially fraudulent platforms promising fast and easy profits to crypto investors, has just expanded its blacklist.

The agency stressed that the compilation does not include all questionable crypto trading platforms, but only those whose fraudulent practices have been reported by consumers. Last week the Belgian financial authority reminded investors that these companies usually claim to offer the best trading platforms for both beginners and professionals.\nPlot to Assassinate Vinnik Uncovered in Greece Law enforcement authorities in Greece have reportedly uncovered a plot to kill Alexander Vinnik in jail. The Russian national was detained in Greece at the request of the United States on suspicions of money laundering in connection with the Mt. Gox hack. “Greek law enforcement received intelligence on plans to prepare an assassination via poisoning with the help of criminals. The head of the prison and the prosecutor of the city of Thessaloniki have summoned Vinnik and informed him about the plot. Special security measures were taken in connection with that,” a source familiar with the details told Sputnik .\nAccording to the report, Vinnik is not allowed to accept any items, including food or beverages, from people he doesn’t know. His contacts with other inmates have been limited and measures have been taken to improve his personal security. Greek police received information about the murder plot earlier this year but it was not made public in order to help the investigation. The presumed murder attempt is said to be linked to the criminal underground and not the special services of any country. According to the quoted source, the assassination has been ordered by someone in Russia. Vinnik has recently expressed readiness to testify to Russian authorities for fintech-related crimes in his home country.\nAlexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in July last year at the request of authorities in the US, where he is suspected of laundering between $4 and $9 billion dollars through the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e , including funds obtained from the notoriously hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox . Russia has also asked for his extradition on other charges and Vinnik himself prefers to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in Moscow. The Russian IT specialist has also filed a petition for political asylum in Greece hoping to avoid extradition to the United States.\nAustralia to Finance Blockchain Research Through Budget Australian authorities intend to finance the research of blockchain technologies through the federal budget for 2018/2019. According to the annual budget report, the government will provide additional $0.7 million AUD (>$0.5 million USD) for the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) which will be tasked to investigate areas where blockchain technology could offer the most value for government services. The agency is expected to use the funds to conduct “research to determine the current maturity of blockchain, assess the readiness for government to adopt the technology, and identify problems that blockchain might be able to solve,” and also, to “understand the potential of using blockchain to support government services.”\nSet up in 2015, DTA aims to facilitate the digitization of the Australian government. The agency has received a total of $92.4 million AUD (almost $70 million USD) in this year’s budget. That means the funds allocated for blockchain research are less than 1%. Nevertheless, the country has already recognized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and passed legislation that treats cryptos like fiat money in the context of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policies. In April, Australia introduced regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. The country’s financial regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has taken measures against “deceptive and misleading initial coin offerings.”\nDubai Exchange Bitoasis Suspends Dirham Withdrawals Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. The trading platform warned its customers that if they want to access their dirham balances or deposit dirhams into in their accounts via wire transfers they will have to initiate an order no later than Tuesday, May 15. Such transactions will not be processed after that date. According to the notice sent to account holders, credit card deposits will be possible until June 16.\nIn the letter, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis claims the restrictions were imposed due to issues with the bank it works with. Other means of buying and selling cryptocurrencies on the platform, as well as digital coin withdrawals to other wallets, are not affected, the exchange noted. “If you decide to leave your fiat balances, the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15 would be to convert them to cryptocurrency and send them to an external wallet,” the statement reads.

Bitcoin Citing Ban on Crypto Pakistanis Find Alternative Ways to Trade Bitcoin Citing Ban on Crypto May 14, 2018 Pakistanis are using alternatives to trade cryptocurrencies even after the State Bank of Pakistan banned banks and financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrencies. The trade volumes are also returning to normal.\nPakistanis are finding new ways of trading cryptocurrencies even after the State Bank banned commercial banks and financial firms from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe volume of cryptocurrency trades slumped after the ban but is returning to normal as users find an alternative by the name of Localbitcoins. In the week of April 28, already more than 163 million Pakistani Rupee (>1.4 million USD) worth of Bitcoin volume traded in Pakistan according to Coin Dance. This volume almost reached the all-time highs of December-January.\nSince the ban, the price of Pakcoin, which is the country’s first and only cryptocoin, jumped by more than 60 percent. Pakcoin founder Abu Shaheer says that ban by the bank is only serving to favor crypto trades. For instance, it is only serving to expose the name of the coin and more people are getting interest in it.\nPeople are already using the coin for mobile phone credit top-ups.\nThe Central Bank gave a circular in early April prohibiting dealing in virtual currencies similar to the Reserve Bank of India. And although the Reserve Bank of India gave banks and traders three months to comply, SBP did not.\nAccording to the directive, all banks, micro finance entities, payment system operators and service providers should refrain from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThis affected cryptocurrency exchanges such as Urdubit, which was exchanging about 100 different digital coins. However, daily across all mediums before the ban.\nThe crypto exchange closed after the ban and asked clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds. Some users still have Bitcoins in their accounts on the platform a month after the ban.\nDanyal Manzar, the exchange’s CEO says there are alternative ways of trading the Bitcoins for those willing to. He says cryptocurrencies would disrupt stock markets and not the entire monetary system.\n“About 80 to 85% of the traders from stock exchanges came to try their luck in virtual currency,” he said.\nMeanwhile, the government is planning to eventually ban all cryptocurrencies according to Asia Times. Thus, quoting the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication. The government official said,\n“We have forwarded our recommendation for a ban on all forms of virtual currency trading. And proper legislation is being working on”. What is your opinion on ban on crypto trading in Pakistan? Lets discuss on Twitter . Do you have a Crypto related story? Get Listed on Coinpedia .

The head of the prison and the prosecutor of the city of Thessaloniki have summoned Vinnik and informed him about the plot. Special security measures were taken in connection with that,” a source familiar with the details told Sputnik .\nAccording to the report, Vinnik is not allowed to accept any items, including food or beverages, from people he doesn’t know. His contacts with other inmates have been limited and measures have been taken to improve his personal security. Greek police received information about the murder plot earlier this year but it was not made public in order to help the investigation. The presumed murder attempt is said to be linked to the criminal underground and not the special services of any country. According to the quoted source, the assassination has been ordered by someone in Russia. Vinnik has recently expressed readiness to testify to Russian authorities for fintech-related crimes in his home country.\nAlexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in July last year at the request of authorities in the US, where he is suspected of laundering between $4 and $9 billion dollars through the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e , including funds obtained from the notoriously hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox . Russia has also asked for his extradition on other charges and Vinnik himself prefers to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in Moscow. The Russian IT specialist has also filed a petition for political asylum in Greece hoping to avoid extradition to the United States. Australia to Finance Blockchain Research Through Budget\nAustralian authorities intend to finance the research of blockchain technologies through the federal budget for 2018/2019. According to the annual budget report, the government will provide additional $0.7 million AUD (>$0.5 million USD) for the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) which will be tasked to investigate areas where blockchain technology could offer the most value for government services. The agency is expected to use the funds to conduct “research to determine the current maturity of blockchain, assess the readiness for government to adopt the technology, and identify problems that blockchain might be able to solve,” and also, to “understand the potential of using blockchain to support government services.”\nSet up in 2015, DTA aims to facilitate the digitization of the Australian government. The agency has received a total of $92.4 million AUD (almost $70 million USD) in this year’s budget. That means the funds allocated for blockchain research are less than 1%. Nevertheless, the country has already recognized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and passed legislation that treats cryptos like fiat money in the context of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policies. In April, Australia introduced regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. The country’s financial regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has taken measures against “deceptive and misleading initial coin offerings.” Dubai Exchange Bitoasis Suspends Dirham Withdrawals\nDubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. The trading platform warned its customers that if they want to access their dirham balances or deposit dirhams into in their accounts via wire transfers they will have to initiate an order no later than Tuesday, May 15. Such transactions will not be processed after that date. According to the notice sent to account holders, credit card deposits will be possible until June 16.\nIn the letter, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis claims the restrictions were imposed due to issues with the bank it works with. Other means of buying and selling cryptocurrencies on the platform, as well as digital coin withdrawals to other wallets, are not affected, the exchange noted. “If you decide to leave your fiat balances, the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15 would be to convert them to cryptocurrency and send them to an external wallet,” the statement reads. Bitoasis warns clients that it cannot provide a specific date for reactivating AED fiat withdrawals.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief stories?

conventional, so it should come as little surprise that his financial advice is also unorthodox.\nWilliams has spent a chunk of his post-football life studying everything from holistic medicine to astrology and he tells CNBC Make It that the studying the cosmos actually informed his decision to invest in the recent cryptocurrency boom .\n\"When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,\" says Williams, who tells CNBC Make It that his readings of astrological charts have pointed him in the direction of Bitcoin.\n\"The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus,\" says Williams.\nUranus, he explains, \"is about revolution; it's about a change in the way we do things; it's about innovation.\" And Taurus \"is about resources and finances,\" says Williams.\nThe revolutionary aspect of Uranus in astrology, combined with Taurus' focus on wealth and finance, is leading Williams to predict that, in the near future, \"we're going to totally change the way we view and understand\" finances, he says.\nWhat's more, Pluto is passing through the astrological sign Capricorn which, Williams explains, \"is about our structures, like banks for instance.\"\n\"I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it's the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things.

In Russia, reports have surfaced of a plot to assassinate Alexander Vinnik in Greece, where he fights an extradition request from US authorities accusing him of laundering billions of dollars, including funds from the hacked Mt. Gox. Elsewhere, Australia allocates budget for blockchain research, and Dubai-based exchange Bitoasis suspends dirham withdrawals.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Ghost Scares Markets, Facebook Mulls Coin Belgium Expands List of Fraudulent Crypto Platforms\nBelgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority has expanded its list of unauthorized and potentially fraudulent crypto companies operating in the country. The financial watchdog has recently published a new warning noting that “the FSMA is receiving an increasing number of consumer complaints regarding investments in cryptocurrencies [and] once again warns the public about these platforms, often operated by fraudsters who are now resorting to cryptocurrencies to swindle consumers.” The regulator also said that people who have invested through these platforms often complain they never recover their funds.\nIn March, the FSMA published its first list of 19 suspicious crypto platforms saying it had received “questions or complaints from consumers and has established indications of fraud,” as news.Bitcoin.com reported . The agency stressed that the compilation does not include all questionable crypto trading platforms, but only those whose fraudulent practices have been reported by consumers. Last week the Belgian financial authority reminded investors that these companies usually claim to offer the best trading platforms for both beginners and professionals. Plot to Assassinate Vinnik Uncovered in Greece\nLaw enforcement authorities in Greece have reportedly uncovered a plot to kill Alexander Vinnik in jail. The Russian national was detained in Greece at the request of the United States on suspicions of money laundering in connection with the Mt. Gox hack. “Greek law enforcement received intelligence on plans to prepare an assassination via poisoning with the help of criminals. The head of the prison and the prosecutor of the city of Thessaloniki have summoned Vinnik and informed him about the plot. Special security measures were taken in connection with that,” a source familiar with the details told Sputnik .\nAccording to the report, Vinnik is not allowed to accept any items, including food or beverages, from people he doesn’t know. His contacts with other inmates have been limited and measures have been taken to improve his personal security. Greek police received information about the murder plot earlier this year but it was not made public in order to help the investigation. The presumed murder attempt is said to be linked to the criminal underground and not the special services of any country. According to the quoted source, the assassination has been ordered by someone in Russia. Vinnik has recently expressed readiness to testify to Russian authorities for fintech-related crimes in his home country.\nAlexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in July last year at the request of authorities in the US, where he is suspected of laundering between $4 and $9 billion dollars through the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e , including funds obtained from the notoriously hacked bitcoin exchange Mt.

The Russian IT specialist has also filed a petition for political asylum in Greece hoping to avoid extradition to the United States. Australia to Finance Blockchain Research Through Budget\nAustralian authorities intend to finance the research of blockchain technologies through the federal budget for 2018/2019. According to the annual budget report, the government will provide additional $0.7 million AUD (>$0.5 million USD) for the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) which will be tasked to investigate areas where blockchain technology could offer the most value for government services. The agency is expected to use the funds to conduct “research to determine the current maturity of blockchain, assess the readiness for government to adopt the technology, and identify problems that blockchain might be able to solve,” and also, to “understand the potential of using blockchain to support government services.”\nSet up in 2015, DTA aims to facilitate the digitization of the Australian government. The agency has received a total of $92.4 million AUD (almost $70 million USD) in this year’s budget. That means the funds allocated for blockchain research are less than 1%. Nevertheless, the country has already recognized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and passed legislation that treats cryptos like fiat money in the context of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policies. In April, Australia introduced regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. The country’s financial regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has taken measures against “deceptive and misleading initial coin offerings.” Dubai Exchange Bitoasis Suspends Dirham Withdrawals\nDubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. The trading platform warned its customers that if they want to access their dirham balances or deposit dirhams into in their accounts via wire transfers they will have to initiate an order no later than Tuesday, May 15. Such transactions will not be processed after that date. According to the notice sent to account holders, credit card deposits will be possible until June 16.\nIn the letter, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis claims the restrictions were imposed due to issues with the bank it works with. Other means of buying and selling cryptocurrencies on the platform, as well as digital coin withdrawals to other wallets, are not affected, the exchange noted. “If you decide to leave your fiat balances, the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15 would be to convert them to cryptocurrency and send them to an external wallet,” the statement reads. Bitoasis warns clients that it cannot provide a specific date for reactivating AED fiat withdrawals.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief stories?

Cryptocurrencies have strong linkages and interconnectedness with standard means of payments and trading applications and rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system.”\nGolix is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform in Zimbabwe, and it also hosts a bitcoin ATM at its Harare offices. Officials at Golix say bitcoin trade is growing in Zimbabwe as it helps plug financial shortages in the country.\nAlthough Golix is the most popular exchange platform for cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe, the central bank has identified other exchanges such as Styx24.\nThe decision by the Zimbabwean central bank to prohibit banks from facilitating trade in cryptocurrencies, it said, stems from other “financial regulators around the world (who) have identified the dangers and risks presented by virtual currencies to financial stability which include risk of loss due to price volatility, theft or fraud, money laundering and other criminal” activities.\n“Further, cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate tax evasion as well as externalization of funds in violation of a country’s laws,” the bank said.\nThis is in stark contrast to South Africa, which said this year it intended to tax cryptocurrencies.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apex bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:52:46.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08279b8caf790ad9ab2fa2bbd6310afabf251e95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAwhgnAPqn3G4EIaEoOUvzZbLHZBxsIQZ1FS7c7FyqlkWDduamvLzDd7", "site_full": "www.freelancer.co.uk", "site": "freelancer.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "bitcoin developer by dollybright89", "title_full": "bitcoin developer by dollybright89", "published": "2018-05-14T14:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56088, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08279b8caf790ad9ab2fa2bbd6310afabf251e95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAwhgnAPqn3G4EIaEoOUvzZbLHZBxsIQZ1FS7c7FyqlkWDduamvLzDd7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T14:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin developer by dollybright89", "text": "Welcome, dear clients!

Cryptocurrencies have strong linkages and interconnectedness with standard means of payments and trading applications and rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system.”\nGolix is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform in Zimbabwe, and it also hosts a bitcoin ATM at its Harare offices. Officials at Golix say bitcoin trade is growing in Zimbabwe as it helps plug financial shortages in the country.\nAlthough Golix is the most popular exchange platform for cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe, the central bank has identified other exchanges such as Styx24.\nThe decision by the Zimbabwean central bank to prohibit banks from facilitating trade in cryptocurrencies, it said, stems from other “financial regulators around the world (who) have identified the dangers and risks presented by virtual currencies to financial stability which include risk of loss due to price volatility, theft or fraud, money laundering and other criminal” activities.\n“Further, cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate tax evasion as well as externalization of funds in violation of a country’s laws,” the bank said.\nThis is in stark contrast to South Africa , which said this year it intended to tax cryptocurrencies.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apex bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:37:14.073+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc766f76404538af0bb0faa3041ec4db22b7cbde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ465xVz5xZrUH3.rfTfd_1qlg--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=34", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Delphi - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-14T14:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc766f76404538af0bb0faa3041ec4db22b7cbde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ465xVz5xZrUH3.rfTfd_1qlg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-14T14:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": " software complex for SEO/SMM\npython 3 antigateantigate ru , I'm shocked!

It was licensed as a bank in 2016 and has gained many more investors since then.\nReuters , citing founder Radoslav Albrecht, reported that Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to get around the Swift international transfer system in order to lend money globally at a lower cost and in a faster time frame. According to the report, this is the first time bitcoin is being used to transfer credit around the globe.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBitbond clients hold the loans in digital tokens for a few seconds or minutes, and then they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where the person is receiving the funds. This avoids the fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrencies. Most of the clients that use the service are small business owners and freelance workers with loans under $50,000. Reuters noted that adoption of cryptocurrency has been fast in Germany, second only to the U.S.\nThe price of bitcoin was under pressure late last week after news surfaced that authorities raided South Korea’s largest crypto-exchange, CNBC reported . UPbit wrote on its website, according to a Google translation, that it “is currently under investigation by prosecution, and we are [cooperating] diligently. UPbit services, such as all transactions and withdrawals, are operating normally. Your assets are kept securely in your account.”\nThough South Korean authorities raided the exchange due to concerns over fraud, the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) did not reply immediately to a request for comment by CNBC. According to CoinMarketCap, the exchange is the third-largest (with fees) in terms of trading volume, with the EOS-won pair representing the largest volume share.\nFollowing the news, bitcoin dropped 5.5 percent to a little over $8,500. The price of bitcoin was $8,649.16 as of 12:50 p.m. on Friday (May 11), according to CoinDesk. By comparison, the cryptocurrency’s value was around $7,600 in February, a level that represented a new two-month low. That slide occurred as global concerns came to bear on the digital currency, tied primarily to bans on buying bitcoin levied by banks.\n- ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bitbond.com/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-bitcoin/german-online-bank-uses-bitcoins-to-transfer-loans-idUSKBN1ID07Y"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:25:42.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e50537d722ba1fea18656ae8600ba6a7ee2d608", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYCJfHTzITcAz4zW7PNcSpZyOH3afzql4Wuyi1wT_nOg__ZKyU2q4fPViikjvnru.x4-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://finance.yahoo.com/rss/EntertainmentDiversified", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Bitcoin Slides as Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Looms", "title_full": "Bitcoin Slides as Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Looms", "published": "2018-05-14T14:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rRle9Cr6PgNo6T.lQ689pA--~B/aD00NzM7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/6661cbfc0e19887a1fb2d97fc7032193", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 58, "comments": 0, "shares": 58}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e50537d722ba1fea18656ae8600ba6a7ee2d608", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYCJfHTzITcAz4zW7PNcSpZyOH3afzql4Wuyi1wT_nOg__ZKyU2q4fPViikjvnru.x4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T14:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Slides as Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Looms", "text": "Bitcoin Slides as Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Looms Bob Mason Reblog Bitcoin gained 2.49% on Sunday, following Saturday’s 0.84% rise, to end the weekend at $8,682.6, recording a 10.1% loss for the week, Monday through Sunday. An early morning fall to an intraday low $8,318.3 saw Bitcoin cold above the day’s first major support level at $8,247.83, with buying appetite building through Sunday morning to support a Bitcoin run through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628 and the day’s first major resistance level at $8,675.13 to an intraday high $8,760 before easing back the day’s end $8,682.6. Holding above the day’s first major resistance level of $8,675.13 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628, was a positive for the Bitcoin bulls, though for Bitcoin to reverse the near-term bearish trend formed at 5 th May’s swing hi $9,999, a move back through the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $8,890 to $9,000 levels would be needed. Until there is greater clarity on the regulatory road ahead, Bitcoin and the broader market is unlikely to see any material upside that could spur the talk of a return to the record highs of last year, with regulator classification of the respective cryptocurrencies expected to have a material impact on the broader market. While the broader market faces the wrath of South Korean regulators, Bitcoin investors are about to discover whether tomorrow’s Bitcoin Cash hard fork will eat into Bitcoin’s cryptomarket dominance. With Bitcoin Cash already being considered a better contender to replace fiat money, the hard fork enhancements, which are due to introduce capabilities such as smart contracts, while also improving transaction times to less than 3 minutes, will give Bitcoin a run for its money. The market response may be muted near-term, however, regulatory risk continuing to be of far greater influence to investor appetite near-term. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 3.61% to $8,370 as the crypto news wires weighed on investor appetite at the start of the week. An early move through to a morning high $8,701 fell short of the day’s first major resistance level at $8,855.63, with negative sentiment across the broader market ultimately leading to a Bitcoin pullback to a morning low $8,271, Bitcoin sliding through the day’s first major support level at $8,413.93 with ease as selling pressure weighed at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628. For the day ahead, a move back through to $8,700 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $8,855.63 would need a shift in sentiment to ease selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628, which may be too big an ask as investors return focus to the regulatory outlook that continues to remain bearish for the cryptomarket. Failure to move through to $8,600 levels will likely lead to a pullback through the morning’s $8,271 low to bring the day’s second major support level at $8,145.27 into play, which would leave investors facing the possibility of Bitcoin visiting sub-$8,000 levels for the first time since 19 th April. This morning’s moves continue to affirm the near-term bearish trend, though as we have seen on countless occasions, even the risk of a material shift in the regulatory landscape is often not enough to leave investors on the sidelines for long, the summer and the expected rollout global regulations still some way off. Elsewhere in the market, Bitcoin Cash continued to lose ground ahead of this week’s fork, down 7.98%, with DASH coming in close behind, down 6.42% for the morning.

B3LP: Hard Fork Was ‘Reason’ To Boot BCH\nIn a blog post May 10, the exchange said that it had been “planning” to stop supporting the altcoin, but that its upcoming hard fork had provided “a reason” to complete the process.\n“Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash the hardfork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P,” the blog post reads.\nBitcoin Cash had generated significant publicity, both positive and negative , when it announced its hard fork plans which are due to go ahead May 15.\nThe latest step in developers’ plans to increase network transaction handling capabilities, prices increased over recent weeks as holders appeared to prepare for an airdrop of coins on the new chain.\nNonetheless, volatility in BCH markets remains higher than that of Bitcoin, the fluctuating considerably as Bitcoin prices fell over the weekend. Failing To Meet Requirements\nReferring to Bitcoin Cash variously as “Bitcash” and “BCash,” BL3P appeared to have little remorse over shutting down its operations and requiring users to withdraw their holdings.\n“BL3P maintains a strict selection policy when it comes to support for altcoins, bitcash unfortunately does not meet these requirements,” the blog post continues.\nFor this reason we have not made it possible to trade bitcash on BL3P. In addition, we will disable the option to withdraw bitcash per 15 May, 2018.\nThe move follows Hong Kong exchange OKEx , which also confirmed it would halt Bitcoin Cash support in April ostensibly due to “inadequate liquidity.”\nBitcoin Cash originally came into being in August 2017 as a hard fork of the Bitcoin network. At the time, proponents claimed the altcoin’s bigger block size would allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\nWhat do you think about BL3P’s decision to remove Bitcoin Cash?

In a lot of cases, such threats are designed to steal sensitive information from companies and service providers. Australia’s Family Planning NSW recently fell victim to such an attack which saw thousands of patients almost having their sensitive details exposed. The criminals demanded a Bitcoin ransom for the sum of AU$15 , 000. The Family Planning NSW Attack Explained\nFamily Planning NSW is one of the largest sexual health providers in Australia. They serve thousands of clients throughout the country. It also means the organization wields a lot of sensitive information, which poses a big target for hackers and other criminals. A recent cyber attack exposed a few weaknesses in the organization’s website, which left their databases vulnerable. To this day, it remains unclear if anyone effectively had their details exposed in the process.\nAccording to company officials, the attack was never about data theft. Instead, the hackers demand a Bitcoin ransom after infiltrating the website. With numerous attacks happening around the time period, the ulterior motive remains rather unclear. In the ransom message, the attackers threatened to shut down the Family Planning NSW website altogether.\nPaying AU$15,000 in ransom is a rather steep amount. There was a timer on the website which showed the amount of time left to make the payment. It is unclear if the ransom has been paid at this stage. The Family Planning NSW website has been shut down to prevent any future attacks or discrepancies. The security weakness used for the previous attack has been addressed as well. Bitcoin Ransom Requests Remain an Issue\nOver the past few years, there has been an influx of criminal activity demanding a Bitcoin ransom. This trend has become most apparent in the malware industry. Various strains of ransomware will lock users out of their computers and won’t restore access until a Bitcoin payment is made. Even so, paying the ransom is no guarantee for getting one’s files unlocked once again.\nTo many people, Bitcoin has sufficient anonymity features to evade law enforcement scrutiny. That is not entirely correct, as blockchain analysis can be applied to Bitcoin transactions. With this method, officials can track down Bitcoin users sooner or later. It is not a viable tool for criminals by any means. Even so, the correlation between Bitcoin and criminal activity has not slowed down in the slightest.\nAttacks such as the one against Family Planning NSW show a lot of online platforms need to beef up their security. For the time being, the Australian Federal Police is still investigating the matter. No internal medical records were exposed, but several databases have been compromised in the end.

B3LP: Hard Fork Was ‘Reason’ To Boot BCH\nIn a blog post May 10, the exchange said that it had been “planning” to stop supporting the altcoin, but that its upcoming hard fork had provided “a reason” to complete the process.\n“Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash the hardfork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P,” the blog post reads.\nBitcoin Cash had generated significant publicity, both positive and negative , when it announced its hard fork plans which are due to go ahead May 15.\nThe latest step in developers’ plans to increase network transaction handling capabilities, prices increased over recent weeks as holders appeared to prepare for an airdrop of coins on the new chain.\nNonetheless, volatility in BCH markets remains higher than that of Bitcoin, the fluctuating considerably as Bitcoin prices fell over the weekend. Failing To Meet Requirements\nReferring to Bitcoin Cash variously as “Bitcash” and “BCash,” BL3P appeared to have little remorse over shutting down its operations and requiring users to withdraw their holdings.\n“BL3P maintains a strict selection policy when it comes to support for altcoins, bitcash unfortunately does not meet these requirements,” the blog post continues.\nFor this reason we have not made it possible to trade bitcash on BL3P. In addition, we will disable the option to withdraw bitcash per 15 May, 2018.\nThe move follows Hong Kong exchange OKEx , which also confirmed it would halt Bitcoin Cash support in April ostensibly due to “inadequate liquidity.”\nBitcoin Cash originally came into being in August 2017 as a hard fork of the Bitcoin network. At the time, proponents claimed the altcoin’s bigger block size would allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\nWhat do you think about BL3P’s decision to remove Bitcoin Cash?

He's no stranger to philanthropy and big goals. Recently he pledged $1 billion to a company called Earth Now, which plans to \"deploy a large constellation of advanced imaging satellites that will deliver real-time, continuous video of almost anywhere on Earth.\" He's also throwing money at an effort to grow meat in labs to solve the world's hunger crisis. But one thing this tech guru with a $91 billion net worth isn't going to get into is Bitcoin.\nHe recently revealed on an episode of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he does not own any cryptocurrency, but he was once given some as a birthday gift. (After all, what do you get the man who quite literally not only has everything but can buy absolutely anything he wants?)\n\"Somebody gave me some for my birthday. A few years later, I thought, 'Hey I'm going to sell that.'\"\nDominic Lipinski-WPA Pool/Getty Images\nAt the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin's price was below $1000. By the end of the year, it was over $19,000. In early 2018 its value dropped sharply. Today, Bitcoin is trading for right around $9,300.\nGates believes that Bitcoin is \"one of the crazier speculative things. I would short it if there was an easy way to do it,\" he said.\nOne of the reasons Gates is not a fan of digital currencies is because he thinks they don't have any real value.\n\"As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. \"It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment,\" he said on CNBC.\nWarren Buffett shares in Gates' skepticism of cryptocurrency, saying:\n\"You're just hoping the next guy pays more. And you only feel you'll find the next guy to pay more if he thinks he's going to find someone that's going to pay more.\"\nGates also has issues with the lack of governance of digital currencies and the anonymity of it:\n\"The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now, cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs, so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way.\"\nHis feelings about cryptocurrency aside, Gates is interested in the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated $10,000 to the blockchain company Bitsoko in 2015. The blockchain is the digital ledger that confirms and records transactions. His foundation also partnered with Ripple, the creator of the XRP cryptocurrency last year in an effort to create mobile payment systems for the poor.\nRead more: Bill Gates Got Some Bitcoin For His Birthday… ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth now", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:31:38.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b96ac819ae4f7cbeaa56c0ee9a4b28a1e2ed75c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa1MeQLQdNpkhBl1izkNSCKOA5sO6TF9CHIP0d.8SGeEtRRQF_LtOUqVaJPuqJaEqL6siF387KHTnToWD00P.ekyGBkOxxpVgm", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "John McAfee about Bitcoin Private: “Superior Monero”", "title_full": "John McAfee about Bitcoin Private: “Superior Monero” : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.331, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b96ac819ae4f7cbeaa56c0ee9a4b28a1e2ed75c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa1MeQLQdNpkhBl1izkNSCKOA5sO6TF9CHIP0d.8SGeEtRRQF_LtOUqVaJPuqJaEqL6siF387KHTnToWD00P.ekyGBkOxxpVgm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EffigyBoy", "published": "2018-05-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "John McAfee about Bitcoin Private: “Superior Monero”", "text": "submitted by /u/EffigyBoy\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cryptovibes.com/crypto-news/john-mcafee-about-bitcoin-private-superior-monero/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T10:11:12.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c680903eab31b4edaeb4eaf612502b8cbf4271d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmf4iPd7JC40inHFCSj.0RYw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Chinese Investor bought 10,000 bitcoin during the dip!", "title_full": "Chinese Investor bought 10,000 bitcoin during the dip!", "published": "2018-05-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c680903eab31b4edaeb4eaf612502b8cbf4271d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmf4iPd7JC40inHFCSj.0RYw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "putrisa", "published": "2018-05-14T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chinese Investor bought 10,000 bitcoin during the dip!", "text": "I believe in China's country, I have a response to this country.

This bounty was claimed using the published results of several security researchers who generated such a collision. Additional bounties remain open for other hash functions supported by Bitcoin: SHA256, RIPEMD160, SHA256d, and RIPEMD(SHA256()).\nThere may be other users of OP_SHA1.
