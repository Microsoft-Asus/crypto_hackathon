Bitcoin Developers Call For GitHub Exit\nThe takeover, which anonymous sources claim should see an official announcement later Monday, has led to multiple calls to remove Bitcoin activity from the code repository.\nGithub had previously stated it would strive to remain independent, even planning an IPO in 2017. The company’s CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath resigned in August, with executives “struggling” to find a suitable replacement since, Business Insider reported when it first broke the news Friday.\nBitcoin development has traditionally used the website as a global participation environment. Unsurprisingly, news of a corporate takeover failed to impress community figures, who demanded Bitcoin activity be taken elsewhere.\n“Yes,” Bitcoin core developer Wladimir J. van der Laan wrote on Twitter when asked whether developers should abandon GitHub permanently.\n“No real hurry, but I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of (GitHub) toward obsolence (sic), possibly ending the same way as codeplex did,” he explained.\nTo be clear: many bitcoin core contributors already preferred moving to independently hosted infrastructure in the long run. This may or may not speed it up. Rival Service Sees 10X Growth\nOthers continued the narrative that Microsoft would stunt the project’s potential.\n“There is no GitHub replacement, we all know (Microsoft) will run it into the ground,” one Twitter comment reads in response to criticism of the potential bill Microsoft paid for ownership. You could've acquired Github too. All you had to do is create a $2 billion ICO. https://t.co/0LKn8x3Lgh\n— WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) June 4, 2018\nIn future, Bitcoin development could move to rival independent service GitLab, a trending hashtag #movingtogitlab already doing the rounds online.\nOn Sunday, two days after the Microsoft rumors began circulating, the company reported ten times the usual number of projects migrating amid efforts to keep up with demand.\n“We’re scaling our fleet to try to stay up,” officials announced, reproducing data confirming the giant spike in migration from GitHub.\nWhat do you think about Microsoft purchasing GitHub and its impact on Bitcoin?

But you still have only 1 BTC.\nNow think you have 1 btc and you convert it into BCH. Example for 1 BTC you get 10 BCH. Rate per bch is 0.1 BTC .\nAfter some day if Bitcoin grow up, At the same time BCH also will grow up.\nIf bch rate grow 1.5 btc then you will have 1.5 BTC.\nBut before buy alt coin please select best coin to avoid dump.\nSo what you think.

Developers have taken measures to increase the difficulty of future attacks. The event-ticketing platform Ticketfly is also trying to recover from a hijack. 26 million accounts have been reportedly compromised by a hacker who asked for bitcoin ransom.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round Zencash Attacked with Two Double-Spends\nThe Zencash network has been targeted in a 51% attack on Saturday, June 2. The attacker managed to successfully perform two double-spend transactions while reorganizing the blockchain multiple times and reverting 38 blocks in the longest reorganization.\nAccording to a released statement , the Zencash team received warning of potential attack from a pool operator and took measures to raise the difficulty of future attacks on the network, contacting exchanges to increase confirmation times and recommending a minimum of 100 required confirmations.\nThe attacker(s) caused the reorganizations of the blockchain between blocks 318165 and 318275. They performed the double-spend attacks in blocks 318204 and 318234 – for 13,000 and 6,600 ZEN, respectively, worth more than $550,000 at current prices.\nAccording to the forensic analysis conducted with the affected exchange, the suspect pool address is znkMXdwwxvPp9jNoSjukAbBHjCShQ8ZaLib and the suspect exchange deposit address is zneDDN3aNebJUnAJ9DoQFys7ZuCKBNRQ115.\nAt the time of the attack the network’s hashrate was 58MSol/s. Developers believe that the attacker has a private mining operation large enough to conduct the attack and/or supplement with rental hash power. Zencash is a proof of work coin based on the equihash algorithm. All equihash-based networks are exposed to possible influx of new equihash power, the team noted. Ticketfly Hijacked by Hacker, Trying to Recover\nTicketfly has been reportedly attacked by a hacker who breached its website last week and demanded a ransom in bitcoin to release it. The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We’re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline.\nIn correspondence with Motherboard , the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.\n“We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports.\nIt’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach. Ticketfly is owned by San-Francisco based Eventbrite, which bought the platform from Pandora Media in a $200 million deal about a year ago. Avalon Blockchain Unwinds Acquisition of Crypto Assets\nAvalon Blockchain Inc., formerly known as World Mahjong Ltd., has announced it has reached an agreement with Avalon Life S.A. to unwind the acquisition of crypto mining assets and cryptocurrencies it has previously bought. According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies.\nWorld Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining abilities and cryptocurrency assets from the mining and community knowledge network Avalon Life SA and Avalon Projects Canada Inc. More than 27,000 ASIC mining machines were purchased, along with a number of Dash, Vivo, and Pura coins.\nEarlier this year it was reported that the company had also changed its name to Avalon Blockchain. In its latest statement, however, it said it was unable to execute its proposed business plan involving these crypto assets. Following the agreement with the vendor, Avalon Blockchain will return them to Avalon Life SA and will arrange the cancellation of 120,000,000 common shares that have been issued.\nAvalon Projects Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Avalon Blockchain, has completed the offering of 37,154,502 subscription receipts, at a price of $0.50 each. The company now intends to allow subscribers to rescind their subscriptions.

Developers have taken measures to increase the difficulty of future attacks. The event-ticketing platform Ticketfly is also trying to recover from a hijack. 26 million accounts have been reportedly compromised by a hacker who asked for bitcoin ransom.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round\nZencash Attacked with Two Double-Spends\nThe Zencash network has been targeted in a 51% attack on Saturday, June 2. The attacker managed to successfully perform two double-spend transactions while reorganizing the blockchain multiple times and reverting 38 blocks in the longest reorganization.\nAccording to a released statement , the Zencash team received warning of potential attack from a pool operator and took measures to raise the difficulty of future attacks on the network, contacting exchanges to increase confirmation times and recommending a minimum of 100 required confirmations.\nThe attacker(s) caused the reorganizations of the blockchain between blocks 318165 and 318275. They performed the double-spend attacks in blocks 318204 and 318234 – for 13,000 and 6,600 ZEN, respectively, worth more than $550,000 at current prices.\nAccording to the forensic analysis conducted with the affected exchange, the suspect pool address is znkMXdwwxvPp9jNoSjukAbBHjCShQ8ZaLib and the suspect exchange deposit address is zneDDN3aNebJUnAJ9DoQFys7ZuCKBNRQ115.\nAt the time of the attack the network’s hashrate was 58MSol/s. Developers believe that the attacker has a private mining operation large enough to conduct the attack and/or supplement with rental hash power. Zencash is a proof of work coin based on the equihash algorithm. All equihash-based networks are exposed to possible influx of new equihash power, the team noted.\nTicketfly Hijacked by Hacker, Trying to Recover\nTicketfly has been reportedly attacked by a hacker who breached its website last week and demanded a ransom in bitcoin to release it. The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We’re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline.\nIn correspondence with Motherboard , the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.\n“We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports.\nIt’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach. Ticketfly is owned by San-Francisco based Eventbrite, which bought the platform from Pandora Media in a $200 million deal about a year ago.\nAvalon Blockchain Unwinds Acquisition of Crypto Assets\nAvalon Blockchain Inc., formerly known as World Mahjong Ltd., has announced it has reached an agreement with Avalon Life S.A. to unwind the acquisition of crypto mining assets and cryptocurrencies it has previously bought. According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies.\nWorld Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining Facebook Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "zencash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zencash targeted", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T14:11:37.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec35675c6d01e6c2fa421258d77bb05686ebc2ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfA0xdwW_pclXu1bwJnrq9C3YQaj_PD9eTp18gU.u291_GaaIs5OD3HTBYy4zBQWxfaZgEWSzkVrN98XUW6oCIqKA7FQoURUO9fnQKJ4jsC7sEy10lywHetWwBhNEbxiZKJ6mDKIXK6JJG1SWFomPYeY29cg1V09BJw--", "site_full": "www.finanztreff.de", "site": "finanztreff.de", "site_section": "http://www.finanztreff.de/rdf_news_category-ticker_alle.rss", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "finanztreff.de / TICKER_ALLE", "title": "DGAP-News: Bitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director", "title_full": "DGAP-News: Bitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director", "published": "2018-06-04T13:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.finanztreff.de/1/chartNG.gfn?chartType=0&time=10000&instrumentId=789088&width=180&height=135&subProperty=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37255, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec35675c6d01e6c2fa421258d77bb05686ebc2ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfA0xdwW_pclXu1bwJnrq9C3YQaj_PD9eTp18gU.u291_GaaIs5OD3HTBYy4zBQWxfaZgEWSzkVrN98XUW6oCIqKA7FQoURUO9fnQKJ4jsC7sEy10lywHetWwBhNEbxiZKJ6mDKIXK6JJG1SWFomPYeY29cg1V09BJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T13:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "DGAP-News: Bitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director", "text": "DGAP-News: Bitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director 04.06.2018 - 12:56 | Quelle: DGAP | Lesedauer etwa 3\nDGAP-News: Bitcoin Group SE / Key word(s): Change of PersonnelBitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director04.06.2018 / 12:56The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\nBitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director\n- Former member of the Management Board of ACON Actienbank starts with immediate effect\n- Responsibilities involve the development of Bitcoin.de into a crypto and token exchange\n- Bitcoin Group SE is thus driving forward the professionalization of its structures\nHerford, June 4, 2018 - At its meeting today, the Board of Directors of Bitcoin Group SE (ISIN DE000A1TNV91) appointed Mr. Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director of the Company with immediate effect.Due to the dynamic growth of Bitcoin Group SE, supported by strong demand for cryptocurrencies, the Group will further professionalize its structures.

I'm going to sketch out what I think is a \"radical\" idea for a GBIF Challenge entry.\nTL;DR GBIF should issue it's own cryptocurrency and use that to fund the development of the GBIF network by charging for downloading cleaned, processed data (original provider data remains free). People can buy subscriptions to get access to data, and/or purchase GBIF currency as a contribution or investment. Proceeds from the purchase of cleaned data are divided between GBIF (to fund the portal), the data providers (to reward them making data available) and the GBIF nodes in countries included in the geographic coverage of the data (to help them build their biodiversity infrastructure). The challenge entry would involve modelling this idea and conducting simulations to test it's efficacy. The motivation for this idea comes from several sources:\n1. GBIF is (under-)funded by direct contributions from governments, hence each year it essentially \"begs\" for money. Several rich countries (such as the United Kingdom) struggle to pay the fairly paltry sums involved. Part of the problem is that they are taking something of demonstrable value (money) and giving it to an organisation (GBIF) which has no demonstrable financial value. Hence the argument for funding GBIF is basically \"it's the right thing to do\". This is not really a tenable or sustainable model.\n2. Many web sites provide information for \"free\" in that the visitor doesn't pay any money. Instead the visitor views ads and, whether they are aware if it or not, are handing over large amounts of data about themselves and their behaviour (think the recent scandal involving Facebook).\n3. Some people are rebelling against the \"free with ads\" by seeking other ways to fund the web. For example, the Brave web browser enables you to buy BATS ( Basic Attention Tokens , based on Ethereum). You can choose to send BATS to web sites that you visit (and hence find valuable). Those sites don't need to harvest tyour data or bombard you with ads to receive an income.\n4. Cryptocurrency is being widely explored as a way to raise funding for new ventures. Many of these are tech-based, but there are some interesting developments in conservation and climate change, such as Veridium which offsets carbon emissions. There are links between efforts like Veridium and carbon offset programmes such as the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve , so you can go from cryptocurrency to trees.\n5. The rather ugly, somewhat patronising furore that erupted when Rwanda decided that the best way to increase it's foreign currency earnings (as a step towards ultimately freeing itself from dependency on development aid) was to sign a sponsorship deal with Arsenal football club .\nNow, imagine a situation where GBIF has a cryptocurrency token (e.g., the \"GBIF coin\"). Anyone, whether a country, an organisation, or an individual can buy GBIF coins. If you want to download GBIF data, you will need to pay in GBIF coins, either per-download or via a monthly subscription. The proceeds from each download are split in a way that supports the GBIF network as a whole. For example, imagine GBIF itself gets 30% (like Apple's App Store). The remaining 70% gets' split between (a) the data providers and (b) the GBIF nodes in countries included in the data download. For example, almost all the data on a country such as Rwanda does not come from Rwanda itself, but from other countries. You want to reward anyone who makes data available, but you also want to support the development of a biodiversity data infrastructure in Rwanda (or any other country), so part of the proceeds go to the GBIF node in Rwanda.\nNow, an immediate issue (apart from the merits or otherwise of blockchains and cryptocurrency) is that I'm advocating charging for access to data, which seems antithetical to open access. To be clear, I think open access is crucial. I'm suggesting that we distinguish between two classes of data. The first is the data as it is provided to GBIF. That is almost always open data under a CC0 license, and that remains free. But if you ant it for free it is served as it is received. In other words, for free access to data GBIF is essentially a dumb repository (like, say, Dryad ). The data is there, you can search the metadata for each dataset, so essentially you get something like the current dataset search .\nThe other thing GBIF does is that it processes the data, cleaning it, reconciling names and locations, and indexing it, so that if you want to search for a given species, GBIF summarises the data across all the datasets and (often) presents you with a better result that if you'd downloaded all the original data and simply merged it together yourself. This is a valuable service, and its one of the reasons why GBIF costs money to run. So imagine that we do something like this:\nIt is free to browse GBIF as a person and explore the data It is free to download the raw data provided by any data publisher. It costs to download cleaned data that corresponds to a specific query, e.g. all records for a particular taxon, geographic area, etc. Payment for access to cleaned data is via the GBIF coin. The cost is small, on the scale of buying a music track or subscribing to Spotify. Now, I don't expect GBIF to embrace this idea anytime soon. By nature it's a conservative, risk-averse organisation. But I think something like this idea deserves serious attention, ideally from people with much better understanding of the issues that my own \"I saw this on Twitter therefore it must be cool\" level. One way to move forward would be to model how such a system would work, based for example on data on web site visits and data downloads on the current GBIF portal. I suspect models could be built to give some idea of whether such an approach would be financially viable. It occurs to me that something like this would make a great GBIF Challenge entry, particularly as it is gives a license for thinking the unthinkable with no risk to GBIF itself.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T14:08:43.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "497584dca769e2ee05ff66886116ddfa26050d5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrMTCDy6ddiue4RFGyU8ReJc_mVqS8wkHfJWQxoKVRM7NUE3BLJBb4qpoL4kNdhEUPh7bWT8ft.ODb3hXpUueOLNOWz0N6GkU-", "site_full": "www.acorndomains.co.uk", "site": "acorndomains.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.acorndomains.co.uk/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Acorn Domains Forum - .UK Domain Name & Online Business Forum", "title": "Is Bitcoin the Next Big Thing?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin the Next Big Thing?", "published": "2018-06-04T13:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.acorndomains.co.uk/data/avatars/m/0/275.jpg?1458855583", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 92666, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "497584dca769e2ee05ff66886116ddfa26050d5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrMTCDy6ddiue4RFGyU8ReJc_mVqS8wkHfJWQxoKVRM7NUE3BLJBb4qpoL4kNdhEUPh7bWT8ft.ODb3hXpUueOLNOWz0N6GkU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "accelerator (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2018-06-04T13:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin the Next Big Thing?", "text": "509 accelerator said: ↑ This is the first time I've heard of this.

From the article I linked to above: The most lucrative attacks are carried out on online services that store the private keys for a large number of users, as Sheep Marketplace did. It seems these attacks are often carried out by insiders who don’t have to do much hacking at all.

The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.\n“We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports.\nIt’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach.

Gründe für eine Kryptosucht seien das hohe Risiko und die große Fluktuation im Markt. Diese sorgten für Spannung, führten aber auch zur Realitätsflucht. Die Therapie im Craig Hospital richtet sich deshalb nach den Methoden für Spielsüchtige. Sicherheits-Newsletter Sie haben es fast geschafft!

Spectacular gains of over 3000% in 2017 followed by spectacular volatility in 2018 make this asset class stand out. On one side, digital currency libertarians and techies herald the arrival of financial freedom from the establishment: governments, central banks and large financial institutions. On the other hand, the kings of finance criticize the space: Jamie Dimon called advocators of digital currencies stupid, while Ray Dalio warned against a bubble.\nIn todays column, I wanted to share our thinking about digital currencies through the prism of disruption. In Asset Managers Prepare to Be Disrupted, my co-authors, David Teten and Brent Beardsley, and I argue that the investment industry has changed very little, while other industries have undergone dramatic disruption. Factors such as technological innovation, social change and political constructs often drive change in unexpected ways. Todays viewpoints of traditional finance toward digital currency remind us of past infamous Quote: s from the establishment when faced with disruption. In 1977, Ken Olson, founder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corp, famously said, There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home, which has become a warning against the blind spot that prevents many successful business leaders from seeing disruption.\nNon-linear technology advancement makes it possible to completely re-envision an entire industry. Technology is often used to automate existing processes or to generate efficiency, such as using the internet to order DVDs. True disruption, however, occurs when new technology enables radically different business models to be created. The evolution of Netflix exemplifies that: streaming video content is a disruptive technology that has impacted the consumption of DVD video content. Similarly, the advent of blockchain technology radicalized the trading processes, thus disintermediating large financial institutions and governments. This allowed for the invention of Bitcoin, a currency that is not backed by any government or any underlying asset and is mined through solving complex computational riddles.\nAn emerging social sub-culture is hungry for change. A new generation of avant-guard thinkers go against the status quo and embrace disruption first. During the internet boom, Silicon Valley became the cradle of an entirely new culture of irreverent techies who were not afraid to question everything and make bold moves. Today, an innovative generation that cares very little about what the established titans of our industry think constitutes currency have completely redefined how currency is created, exchanged and stored. It seems as though the only thing one needs for a currency to exist is buyers and sellers who want to transfer value between each other. The subculture gains momentum taking the establishment by surprise; who thought that Bitcoin would be worth over $10,000?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:18:10.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc56f12d5a5a905b04d8d3fb746e3eb1056c59cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slU54msvIVc8IKDpBaAm1_p2eEbsTq9jTI8Dabcgqkp1UfSq_OjVyg28TjiOPurJZg--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Zencash Targeted in 51% Attack, Ticketfly Hijacked for Ransom", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Zencash Targeted in 51% Attack, Ticketfly Hijacked for Ransom", "published": "2018-06-04T13:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc56f12d5a5a905b04d8d3fb746e3eb1056c59cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slU54msvIVc8IKDpBaAm1_p2eEbsTq9jTI8Dabcgqkp1UfSq_OjVyg28TjiOPurJZg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-04T13:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Zencash Targeted in 51% Attack, Ticketfly Hijacked for Ransom", "text": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Zencash Targeted in 51% Attack, Ticketfly Hijacked for Ransom\nLubomir Tassev\nIn today's Bitcoin in Brief – Zencash has lost $550,000 in two double-spend transactions following a 51% attack on the network.

Connect via:\nOverall, trading in cryptocurrencies has become a bit more challenging in the past couple of months with charts broadly trending nowhere. But this doesn’t mean there isn’t good short-term set-ups waiting for the patient trader, such as the clean head-and-shoulders set-up in Ethereum not long ago. Ripple also at that time gave a good look.\nToday, we’ll take a look at the recent rallies in Ethereum and Bitcoin as they are starting to show signs of ending and leading to another down-move in the not-too-distant future.\nSee how positioning changes in cryptocurrencies and other markets can help as a tool to determine price direction on the IG Client Sentiment page. Ethereum rally brings familiar resistance into play\nEthereum spilled hard from the aforementioned head-and-shoulders pattern, but has since put in a sizable recovery. The rally, though, has a solid level of resistance in play, a familiar area from some time ago.\nCoupling the longer-term area on the daily, turning to the 4-hr there is price resistance in confluence with a trend-line running off the peak last month. ETH/USD is currently sneaking below a minor trend-line off the late-month low. Looking for a continuation lower as the week progresses.\nCheck out this guide to learn more about how to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. ETH/USD Daily Chart (Resistance) ETH/USD 4-hr Chart (Confluence of Resistance) Bitcoin rising wedge could end corrective rally soon\nOn the 4-hr, Bitcoin is posting a rising wedge within the context of a downtrend. This has BTC/USD positioned to make a move lower, but traders will want to see it roll down out of the pattern first, as there is still a chance it pops to the top-side.\nPotentially stopping downside momentum is a trend-line dating back to February, which may be apart of a maturing wedge in place since then. The pattern may want to further itself along towards the apex of the pattern, which, broadly speaking, would be a welcomed event as the pattern could down the line lead to a very strong move.\nFor now, leaning bearish and will continue to monitor. Keep an eye on the daily trend-line on weakness – a hold may give us the larger pattern at some point, while a break could lead down towards 6400.

Developers have taken measures to increase the difficulty of future attacks. The event-ticketing platform Ticketfly is also trying to recover from a hijack. 26 million accounts have been reportedly compromised by a hacker who asked for bitcoin ransom.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round Zencash Attacked with Two Double-Spends\nThe Zencash network has been targeted in a 51% attack on Saturday, June 2. The attacker managed to successfully perform two double-spend transactions while reorganizing the blockchain multiple times and reverting 38 blocks in the longest reorganization.\nAccording to a released statement , the Zencash team received warning of potential attack from a pool operator and took measures to raise the difficulty of future attacks on the network, contacting exchanges to increase confirmation times and recommending a minimum of 100 required confirmations.\nThe attacker(s) caused the reorganizations of the blockchain between blocks 318165 and 318275. They performed the double-spend attacks in blocks 318204 and 318234 – for 13,000 and 6,600 ZEN, respectively, worth more than $550,000 at current prices.\nAccording to the forensic analysis conducted with the affected exchange, the suspect pool address is znkMXdwwxvPp9jNoSjukAbBHjCShQ8ZaLib and the suspect exchange deposit address is zneDDN3aNebJUnAJ9DoQFys7ZuCKBNRQ115.\nAt the time of the attack the network’s hashrate was 58MSol/s. Developers believe that the attacker has a private mining operation large enough to conduct the attack and/or supplement with rental hash power. Zencash is a proof of work coin based on the equihash algorithm. All equihash-based networks are exposed to possible influx of new equihash power, the team noted. Ticketfly Hijacked by Hacker, Trying to Recover\nTicketfly has been reportedly attacked by a hacker who breached its website last week and demanded a ransom in bitcoin to release it. The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We’re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline.\nIn correspondence with Motherboard , the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.\n“We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports.\nIt’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach. Ticketfly is owned by San-Francisco based Eventbrite, which bought the platform from Pandora Media in a $200 million deal about a year ago. Avalon Blockchain Unwinds Acquisition of Crypto Assets\nAvalon Blockchain Inc., formerly known as World Mahjong Ltd., has announced it has reached an agreement with Avalon Life S.A. to unwind the acquisition of crypto mining assets and cryptocurrencies it has previously bought. According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies.\nWorld Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining abilities and cryptocurrency assets from the mining and community knowledge network Avalon Life SA and Avalon Projects Canada Inc. More than 27,000 ASIC mining machines were purchased, along with a number of Dash, Vivo, and Pura coins.\nEarlier this year it was reported that the company had also changed its name to Avalon Blockchain. In its latest statement, however, it said it was unable to execute its proposed business plan involving these crypto assets. Following the agreement with the vendor, Avalon Blockchain will return them to Avalon Life SA and will arrange the cancellation of 120,000,000 common shares that have been issued.\nAvalon Projects Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Avalon Blockchain, has completed the offering of 37,154,502 subscription receipts, at a price of $0.50 each. The company now intends to allow subscribers to rescind their subscriptions. All of them will be offered the option and will be entitled to a full refund of all subscription proceeds tendered to the company.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

(Shutterstock)\nCryptocurrencies should come with two labels – ‘excitement guaranteed’ and ‘handle with care’. Though no-one (even us, blockchain consulting pros) can be 100 percent sure about where Bitcoin is headed, it doesn’t hurt to know that there are certain factors that may influence its price. Here’s what to look for.\nA positive or negative economic outlook of given country. If the economic outlook is positive, people earn money and want to put some away for emergencies or future spending. They can decide to buy Bitcoins as an alternative investment method (especially when interest rates are on very low levels globally). Similarly, a slowing economy will impact people’s (and companies’) earnings and so influence their spending and investment options, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price down.\nCash flow controls in some countries can trigger people’s willingness to diversify some of their assets and convert some of them to cryptocurrencies.\nRead More\nWhy Children Need to Learn Financial Literacy\nAlso, skyrocketing inflation in some countries triggers people’s willingness to switch to currencies that won’t suffer from hyperinflation. When the supply of the currency is decreasing and demand for it is steady (or increasing), there’s upwards pressure on the currency price. So when number of Bitcoins mined every 10 minutes is halved every 4 years, there is a strong possibility that this will trigger some price pressure. If the demand for Bitcoin tokens increases naturally. For example, if we have more merchants accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment, services using Bitcoin tokens as their core platform (eg notaries, smart contract platforms like Rootstock, remittance services), this will increase pressure on Bitcoin price to go up, as the supply of Bitcoins would be limited.\nI encourage you to read up on crypto payments. Successful ICO offerings can also make Bitcoin prices surge. People who like the investment prospects described in the given ICO whitepaper want to back the ICO, and if they don’t have any Bitcoins yet, they need to buy them. Recent multi-million ICO offerings have also demonstrated this.\nMarcin Zduniak, Espeo Block-size issue and the resulting congestion of unconfirmed transactions. If not resolved in timely manner, this can convince some of the Bitcoin users and advocates that Bitcoin isn’t well suited for regular payment usage. This can be due to overly long confirmation waiting times, or due to high transaction fees. In that scenario, they can migrate to other cryptocurrencies that don’t have those kinds of problems (eg Litecoin, which recently implemented segwit and which can offer Lightning Network implementation for off-line transactions based on it). This would drive Bitcoin price down. Possible or actual bugs discovered in Bitcoin protocol or in any of major Bitcoin client/server implementations can have a short-term impact on its price.\nThe trustworthiness of the technology can be undermined, which can temporarily drive Bitcoin’s price down. Other non-monetary projects on top of Bitcoin. Even if they don’t require an extensive number of Bitcoin tokens to run, they can drive its price up, as the mood around the currency and positive press can influence it. Bitcoins confiscated by law enforcement agencies from illicit activities, when sold on the open market, can push the price down. So whenever any agency makes any public notice that they’re going to auction off the confiscated coins, it might temporarily also push market prices down.\nThe post Nine fundamental factors that can drive the price of Bitcoin appeared first on Tahawul Tech.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.albawaba.com/business/why-children-need-learn-financial-literacy-1139580"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "linkedin pinterest delicious stumbleupon digg reddit cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T13:42:45.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5df9ef5881276c3e75553f797973237b7e60b40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme5miIsCF7m.4wOTrFkaiYs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin doesn't exist", "title_full": "Bitcoin doesn't exist", "published": "2018-06-04T13:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5df9ef5881276c3e75553f797973237b7e60b40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme5miIsCF7m.4wOTrFkaiYs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "daddypastes", "published": "2018-06-04T13:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin doesn't exist", "text": "bitcoin will disappear again and don't think that people will stop believing in bitcoin even how many times it will fall down and I think because of the unstable price of btc it will attract more people to invest cos when it fall down it open chances to us to invest and it is up to us when we will sell it so i think bitcoin will stay forever and how come it will disapper when the effect of btc is to help people financially..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T12:38:04.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "507ba5d99bbca397461f4beb75da7a228a10566a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEQcbfn917Dn1JFcZoF1NM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ?", "title_full": "What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ?", "published": "2018-06-04T13:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "507ba5d99bbca397461f4beb75da7a228a10566a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEQcbfn917Dn1JFcZoF1NM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zbaharudin", "published": "2018-06-04T13:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ?", "text": "Quote: from: islakevin on March 25, 2018, 03:50:07 PM What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ? especially your holdings.\nFor now if altcoin and btc prices go down keep your coins.

For instance, if an offer asks you to pay a certain amount as well as you have no concept exactly what you are going to get in exchange, recognize that it's a rip-off.\nGiven that cryptocurrencies are fairly expensive, it's not a smart idea to take risks as well as fall for a fraud. Besides, you do not wish to wind up shedding your difficult made money in a second.\nBitcoin games\nThere are some video games available that will certainly pay you a small amount of this electronic currency if you play it for a while. Normally, these games have a great deal of ads affixed to them.\nAll you should do is maintain playing the video game as well as viewing the ads. In this manner the programmers could make through the ads and also pay you a section of their earnings.\nIf you do not have a problem viewing the advertisements, you can play these video games as well as make some digital cash in return.\nMining\nA number of years back, it was possible to earn lots of Bitcoins through the procedure of mining. Nowadays, it has actually become a great deal more difficult. Today, the market is controlled by big guns that have special devices for mining.\nIf you want to extract the currency, we recommend that you buy great deals of powerful hardware. You can not simply utilize your computer for this purpose.\nUse Affiliate programs\nRegarding my opinion is concerned, this is the most convenient method of earning Bitcoins free of charge. It deserves it. Associate programs operate in all industries as well as cryptocurrency is no exemption. For instance, you could choose to refer a friend in order to gain a discount rate or get paid in Bitcoins. To get more information about it follow free bitcoin .\nMake money in Bitcoin\nActually, it's not 100% totally free. Nevertheless, technically it could be called \"complimentary\". Once more, it's like a video game incentive. You could do this in many ways. As an example, you could ask for donations in Bitcoins on your site. You can deal with somebody that pays in digital currency. You might also ask your companies to release your pay in electronic money. This is feasible if your companies already pay in cryptocurrency.\nIf you are quite hopeful that Bitcoin is mosting likely to rise in worth, we recommend that you proceed and also pay cash money to acquire it. This is the most safe technique up until now. But if this is not feasible for you, after that you can choose any of the approaches provide over. Hopefully, 1 or 2 of the methods will work for you ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T13:12:38.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9450a294bfe52bec96fc8c76ea337374200c63cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaMjg7XuUsHajqGO58kaKjykb_xjxniPe4hHSye8A3_.alpiPLE63nRuMXmOrAFyA10WvzPoWI2W8SBtVBSpRuYEeZGoglFdvd", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Why did coinbase take Bitcoin Cash off of their app?", "title_full": "Why did coinbase take Bitcoin Cash off of their app? : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-04T13:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9450a294bfe52bec96fc8c76ea337374200c63cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaMjg7XuUsHajqGO58kaKjykb_xjxniPe4hHSye8A3_.alpiPLE63nRuMXmOrAFyA10WvzPoWI2W8SBtVBSpRuYEeZGoglFdvd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bacon_Hero", "published": "2018-06-04T13:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why did coinbase take Bitcoin Cash off of their app?", "text": "submitted by /u/Bacon_Hero\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgur.com/Si0av1g"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T09:01:52.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9706627592ca1854983d0ff3d3b064933ab9483d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdNL1lWMOK5uuejHFGCTXBLPecYqSD2ehS1bWmvkNhJBIHINEpR7XS11F5ilKEcO.0-", "site_full": "www.moneygrows.net", "site": "moneygrows.net", "site_section": "http://www.moneygrows.net/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Moneygrows", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for June 04, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for June 04, 2018", "published": "2018-06-04T13:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rzUMrGHALEQCYufJVUjzFFCNgavQCsEFX-CnHcfhvF16kWRdPTtrwxRUclak75fjGclveb3OjMBS6E66Sfoejmn1Ll4U1ELEJ4vbR9vBMchSqB8pA6N_es2ifw6OEPETMsr9Fmc=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9706627592ca1854983d0ff3d3b064933ab9483d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdNL1lWMOK5uuejHFGCTXBLPecYqSD2ehS1bWmvkNhJBIHINEpR7XS11F5ilKEcO.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (MG Network)", "published": "2018-06-04T13:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for June 04, 2018", "text": "Bitcoin analysis for June 04, 2018\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time frame, I found a series of higher highs and higher lows, which is a sign that demand is in control.

There is a key connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $7,540 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $7,500 support area to stay in a positive zone in the near term. Bitcoin price made a nice upside move above $7,700 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently correcting lower towards a major support at $7,500.\nBitcoin Price Analysis The past few sessions were positive as bitcoin price settled above the $7,500 barrier against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded above the $7,550 and $7,600 resistance levels. It traded close to the $7,800 level and posted a high at $7,779. Later, the price started a downside correction and moved below the $7,700 level. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,354 low to $7,779 high.\nHowever, the price is now approaching a crucial support near $7,500. The stated level was a resistance earlier and it may now stop declines below $7,500. There is also a key connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $7,540 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,354 low to $7,779 high is at $7,560. Lastly, the 100 hourly simple moving average is positioned near $7,600 to act as a pivot area.\nLooking at the chart , the price is currently trading near an important support above $7,500. As long as the price stays above $7,500, it could bounce back and retest $7,800. On the flip side, a break below $7,500 may perhaps accelerate losses towards the $7,300 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD has moved back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI has reached the oversold levels near 30.\nMajor Support Level – $7,500\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,800\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Hold This Support? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T12:57:29.092+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2344307a16e072c84a79329ae7f611ddee4003b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_fC2DhDsDYIbXSAhSh4UvkHmzDOArwfYF18iqvZCAamkwwDLhAwfLKAzCuRiVFfoWxVhFmN5bdog--", "site_full": "www.my-review.net", "site": "my-review.net", "site_section": "http://www.my-review.net/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "My-Review.net", "title": "GUIA CRIPTOMONEDAS Y BITCOIN PRO", "title_full": "GUIA CRIPTOMONEDAS Y BITCOIN PRO", "published": "2018-06-04T12:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2344307a16e072c84a79329ae7f611ddee4003b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_fC2DhDsDYIbXSAhSh4UvkHmzDOArwfYF18iqvZCAamkwwDLhAwfLKAzCuRiVFfoWxVhFmN5bdog--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "My Review Team", "published": "2018-06-04T12:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "GUIA CRIPTOMONEDAS Y BITCOIN PRO", "text": "Guia Criptomonedas Y Bitcoin Pro Product Overview : Guia Criptomonedas Y Bitcoin Pro is natural and gives perennial solution to your problem.

The company’s CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath resigned in August, with executives “struggling” to find a suitable replacement since, Business Insider reported when it first broke the news Friday.\nBitcoin development has traditionally used the website as a global participation environment. Unsurprisingly, news of a corporate takeover failed to impress community figures, who demanded Bitcoin activity be taken elsewhere.\n“Yes,” Bitcoin core developer Wladimir J. van der Laan wrote on Twitter when asked whether developers should abandon GitHub permanently.\n“No real hurry, but I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of (GitHub) toward obsolence (sic), possibly ending the same way as codeplex did,” he explained.\nTo be clear: many bitcoin core contributors already preferred moving to independently hosted infrastructure in the long run. This may or may not speed it up.\nRIVAL SERVICE SEES 10X GROWTH\nOthers continued the narrative that Microsoft would stunt the project’s potential.\n“There is no GitHub replacement, we all know (Microsoft) will run it into the ground,” one Twitter comment reads in response to criticism of the potential bill Microsoft paid for ownership.\nIn future, Bitcoin development could move to rival independent service GitLab, a trending hashtag #movingtogitlab already doing the rounds online.\nOn Sunday, two days after the Microsoft rumors began circulating, the company reported ten times the usual number of projects migrating amid efforts to keep up with demand.\n“We’re scaling our fleet to try to stay up,” officials announced, reproducing data confirming the giant spike in migration from GitHub.\nhttp://bitcoinist.com/microsoft-buy-github-bitcoin-devs-exit/\nbe not idiot", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitcoinist.com/microsoft-buy-github-bitcoin-devs-exit/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T05:03:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe4c51ca6b6f1f815bcceb4ac4a6d2e5a8a363c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf376.rdXUb9Gsdnwv_3Fps3m4QZrUvQLQav9AhGdWvPqd", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Apple Watch", "title": "My watchOS : Bitcoin", "title_full": "My watchOS : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-04T11:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.222, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe4c51ca6b6f1f815bcceb4ac4a6d2e5a8a363c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf376.rdXUb9Gsdnwv_3Fps3m4QZrUvQLQav9AhGdWvPqd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Styletokill", "published": "2018-06-04T11:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "My watchOS : Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/Styletokill\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T13:20:12.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1592ae44c5e1032b4f37a57cb5b65b3048a5f10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqJ3jzAPb1vLUCD6SAwIo6D8BAzc8rlX0_kwGrf2PAyOhnV74eKkZ_0fwOhupGq5A-", "site_full": "cryptopotato.com", "site": "cryptopotato.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis June.4", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis June.4", "published": "2018-06-04T11:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5b14ea22aa805-min-300x150.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1592ae44c5e1032b4f37a57cb5b65b3048a5f10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqJ3jzAPb1vLUCD6SAwIo6D8BAzc8rlX0_kwGrf2PAyOhnV74eKkZ_0fwOhupGq5A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-06-04T11:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis June.4", "text": "in: Altcoin 0 Views\nConsolidation period.

Is improving performance ahead for Bitcoin? Bitcoin Bitcoin\nIn the last month the Bitcoin price has fallen from around $9800 to $7600. That’s a fall of around 22% in the space of four weeks, which suggests that the virtual currency continues to offer a volatile performance.\nIt means that most of the gains made in April have now been reversed, with it trading within $1000 of its 2018 low of $6775.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if its downtrend continued over the coming trading sessions, with there being the potential for a fall to a new low for the calendar year. Such is its volatility, though, that in the near term it could move sharply in either direction.\nThat’s part of the reason why I’ve always avoided buying Bitcoin for my own portfolio. Although I have been tempted at times to buy a relatively small amount as a bit of a ‘punt’, I have felt that it is little more than gambling for me in the near term. I find it difficult to determine which direction it will move in the short term, and in the long run I believe its appeal could be more limited than the market is pricing in.\nThe idea that it could replace traditional currencies seems unlikely in my view. Bitcoin has a size limit which means that its scalability may be insufficient to replace traditional currency. I also have doubts about its infrastructure as well as the potential regulatory risks that it could face.\nFor me, blockchain could be the real opportunity when it comes to virtual currencies. Already, it is starting to gain traction in various industries according to my research. And this trend could continue and open opportunities for growth over the long run.\nIn terms of investing in virtual currencies, it continues to lack appeal for me. Equities and other traditional assets hold greater potential in my eyes, with their risk to reward ratios being easier to determine and, in my opinion, more appealing for the long term.

The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nAlthough a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.\nThe FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘ liquid democracy ,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance . The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’ – a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.\nEffectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.\nGiven somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue , so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.\nIn October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.\nWisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature . The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.\nEmmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.\nIn South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency .\nHeroes of Crypto-Funded Campaigns\nInstitutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.\nHowever, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding.\nAndrew Hemingway\nA Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary.\nJared Polis\nU.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations . In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin.\nDan Elder\nThe libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin . The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again.\nRand Paul\nA feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir .\nGreg Abbott\nIn an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state.\nAustin Petersen\nA Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘ no-brainer .’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:\n“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.”\nPatrick Nelson\nDemocratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘ 21st century campaign ,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York.\nBrian Forde\nForde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support .\n* * *\nEven though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

session on Friday, only to turn around and form a shooting star for the day. This is a market that cannot seem to pick up its feet, and I think it’s only a matter of time before we break down towards the $7000 level. If we break down below the $7000 level, I think we will eventually go looking towards the $6000 level underneath. I recognize that rallies at this point are still to be sold, as the $8000 level above offers significant resistance. When you look at the chart, it’s easy to see that we continue to make lower highs, and that of course is a very negative sign. Someday, we could break down below the $6000 level, and that should send this market to the $5000 level after that. If we can break above the $8000 level, we could go as high as the $9000 level, but that seems to be very unlikely.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin also tried to rally against Japanese yen but turned around to show signs of exhaustion as we ended up forming a shooting star. I think the market will continue to go much lower, perhaps reaching down to the ¥700,000 level. That’s the bottom of the overall consolidation area, and as you can see this market looks very much like the BTC\\/USD pair. If we can break down below the ¥700,000 level, that should send the market much lower, perhaps reaching down to the ¥600,000 level. Rallies at this point are to be sold, as we continue to struggle in general when it comes to the crypto currency markets. The ¥1 million level above is a major resistance barrier that I do not think this market will be able to break anytime soon.\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.
