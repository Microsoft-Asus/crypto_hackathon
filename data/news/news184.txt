The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.

PART: Bitcoin Falls Again: What's Been Driving the Crypto Market? PART 1 OF 1 Bitcoin Falls Again: What’s Been Driving the Crypto Market? By Meera Shawn | May 22, 2018 9:44 am EDT Ups and downs keep coming\nCryptocurrencies have continued their fluctuation, alternating between gains and losses. As of 7:30 AM Eastern Time on May 22, bitcoin had fallen ~2.5% over the last 24 hours and was trading at $8,273. Top cryptos Ethereum and Ripple also fell, declining 3% and 2.7%, respectively.\nAll top cryptos’ market caps have fallen. Cryptos’ market cap was $374 billion, with bitcoin dominating the market with a 37.7% share. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) was trading at $13.60, about 0.55% higher than its previous trading day.\nThe top cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours—Factom, MaidSafeCoin, CyberMiles, and Nuls—have risen 9.9%, 8.8%, 5.9%, and 5.7%, respectively. The worst performers— Bitcoin Private, IOSToken, Bitcoin Diamond, and Waltonchain—have fallen 15.8%, 10%, 8.4%, and 8.3%, respectively. Interested in SPX-INDEX? SPX-INDEX PayPal versus Square\nThe above chart compares the performance of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) and broader equity markets depicted by the S&P 500 (SPX). PayPal ( PYPL ), the global leader in digital payments, saw its stock rally on news of its acquisition of Swedish payment company iZettle, which put to bed rumors regarding Paypal to buy Square ( SQ ). US-based Square had begun testing a bitcoin exchange so that users of its app could buy and sell the cryptocurrency, whereas Paypal had filed a patent for an “Expedited Virtual Currency Transaction System,” according to CoinDesk .\nThe ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ), one of the first exchange-traded funds to invest in bitcoin, has divested much of its bitcoin holdings, citing regulatory and tax concerns. Though ARKK did not directly own bitcoin, it purchased shares in Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) in 2015.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-eyes-instant-crypto-payments-tech/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meera shawn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin investment trust", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "waltonchain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:04:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d60f8cd78bc51a3150c58d5d6f7d870d7e8043a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiGRe2thRtpGa6JNKrVOgJaYwbrwgvM2vvVB8UtyQdL7J2vXSPRZI2fA-", "site_full": "www.howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site": "howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site_section": "http://www.howbitcoinminingworks.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How Bitcoin Mining Works", "title": "Today is Bitcoin Pizza Day!", "title_full": "Today is Bitcoin Pizza Day!", "published": "2018-05-22T12:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d60f8cd78bc51a3150c58d5d6f7d870d7e8043a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiGRe2thRtpGa6JNKrVOgJaYwbrwgvM2vvVB8UtyQdL7J2vXSPRZI2fA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mosquito Control (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T12:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Today is Bitcoin Pizza Day!", "text": "\nhttps://ift.tt/2x1QI03 via /r/Bitcoin https://ift.tt/2LjeA2t ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:09:14.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d210d8e9e87312fe21b5be44e781a5fe0c303482", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdEBdE3FaaPydx9OY1ipqF8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Homeless use Bitcoin", "title_full": "Homeless use Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-22T12:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d210d8e9e87312fe21b5be44e781a5fe0c303482", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdEBdE3FaaPydx9OY1ipqF8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Badik", "published": "2018-05-22T12:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Homeless use Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: fabriciofenenga on March 08, 2018, 09:22:50 PM Guys what do you think about Homeless people who use cryptocurrency on the street is that an evolution or something else ?\nhttps://image.ibb.co/nnubQ7/12.jpg\nMaybe some other people knowing what bitcoin really is, coahing homeless guy to ask financially to the people who knows about blockchain and cryptocurrency maybe this deed isnt a good start for this man instead working hard to accomplished his goals and proceed doing some crypto activity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:39:34.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4087a395735aa2961e969c8cb7a2fd6d9aea93d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSc5npruJZbXekzo9ishhKLdTbnLNS8WJuR07bKjLRm1Nlo67wdnSsGZw8q0L5jE4nDPHvv2gHQO2gsTwp3CFZiEOtnpt3p78V4iSvvg7bIvQ--", "site_full": "delittodiusura.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://delittodiusura.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Delitto di Usura", "title": "La Street Art si autofinanzia con codici QR e bitcoin.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,370 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must hold the $8,240 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses. Bitcoin price is trading above a major support at $8,240 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD should stay above the 100 hourly SMA to trim recent losses.\nBitcoin Price Analysis After trading towards the $8,600 level, bitcoin price faced a selling interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a short-term top at $8,596 and started a downside move. The price declined and moved below the $8,400 support level. More importantly, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high.\nIt opened the doors for more losses, resulting in a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair almost tested the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high. However, the price is currently holding the 100 hourly simple moving average and $8,280. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at $8,400, followed by the all-important $8,600. As long as the price is above the 100 hourly SMA, it could make an attempt to surpass the $8,400 level. On the other hand, a close below the 100 hourly SMA may perhaps push the price back towards $8,150.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $8,240. However, BTC buyers must clear the $8,400 hurdle for a push towards $8,600.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving higher towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,240\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,400\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Hold 100 SMA? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:24:44.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fefa1ee961325b374e795122b461800556adc09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbFuHbjzQIQK6DnJZSOq6IC13parxwetioGgykGQ0zAxS2GOP48GE7xpODb5DZaWdg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "I'm about to open a store that only accepts Bitcoin!", "title_full": "I'm about to open a store that only accepts Bitcoin!", "published": "2018-05-22T12:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fefa1ee961325b374e795122b461800556adc09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbFuHbjzQIQK6DnJZSOq6IC13parxwetioGgykGQ0zAxS2GOP48GE7xpODb5DZaWdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T12:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "I'm about to open a store that only accepts Bitcoin!", "text": "I'm about to open a store that only accepts Bitcoin!\n/u/mofobit\nHello Everyone at r/Bitcoin I've created an online store that only accepts crypto-currency.

At a filing entered a week ago at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, the broker said that, although it supplied blockchain project Tezos with a few cryptocurrency conversion services, its actions shouldn’t be grouped with those of the firm as regards the claims in the litigation investor attraction Tezos Bruce MacDonald. The filing states: Bitcoin Switzerland argues that it’s not correctly named as a suspect in the Tezos litigation due to its insufficient contacts with both California and the US enough to establish personal jurisdiction and since the alleged limited currency conversion services that it has provided, exclusively in Switzerland, to the alleged ICO Tezos, and its alleged article ICO conduct, can’t establish liability under Sections 5 and 12 of the Securities Act.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, MacDonald’s December 2017 complaint alleges that Tezos violated U.S. Securities legislation in the sale of its token. Previous lawsuits filed in relation to the ICO also included allegations of securities law violations, along with investor fraud. In its motion, Bitcoin Switzerland again distanced itself from Tezos, saying that the plaintiff could not connect the two organizations from the litigation. As such, it claims that the court doesn’t have jurisdiction over Bitcoin Switzerland AG and for that reason it shouldn’t be involved with the action. Bitcoin Switzerland also claims that MacDonald didn’t even specify a certain Grievance against it, writing, To maintain a claim under Section 12 of the Securities Act, an applicant must allege that the defendant sold or offered a security in violation of 15 U.S.C.\n&sect, 77e to the plaintiff.” . But it carries on. Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege: that Bitcoin Suisse offered or sold a security in connection with the Tezos ICO, which Plaintiff purchased a security from Bitcoin Switzerland in connection with the Tezos ICO.” .

Today, those bitcoins are worth a whopping $83 million. On May 22, 2010, a developer bought two pizzas using 10,000 units of a then-little-known digital currency called bitcoin.\nToday, the price of a single bitcoin has hit $8,300 – making 10,000 of them worth a staggering $83 million.\nBitcoin is going nuclear. Just a year ago, it was trading at less than $750, after deflating from what was then seen as the giddy highs of about $1,100 (£847) in late 2013. It has since embarked on an epic bull run.\n“8k is a seminal moment for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general,” CryptoCompare CEO Charles Hayter said in an emailed statement, “highlighting the supernormal returns and speculative like nature of the industry as well as the potential and growing adoption.”\nThe digital currency has come a long way since 2010, when the purchase of the two Papa John’s pizzas by Laszlo Hanyecz from another bitcoin enthusiast marked what is believed to be the first “real-world” bitcoin transaction.\nHe posted on the Bitcoin Talk forum on May 22, 2010, writing (emphasis ours):\n“ I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day . I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!\n“I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.\n“If you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.”\nTen thousand coins were then worth about $40 (£30). A British user agreed to buy the pizza for him, and even at the time the buyer got a good deal out of it: The person paid only $25 (£19) for the two pizzas.\n(The two actual pizza’s of Laszlo Hanyecz)\nThe date is now marked on an annual basis by bitcoin users in a lighthearted celebration known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”\nAnd today, 10,000 bitcoins add up to about $83 million .\n“It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz told The New York Times in 2013. “No one knew it was going to get so big.” Last year it even reached to over $ 20,000 for one single Bitcoin!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles hayter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:08:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0551774a638c90b1b67af42c48eb2c96a3471ed6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powc7S.5E5gPw01cBwrAlAMfQTac7FZykQ1ywpPGz1EZUdFkfnjW3QnYChpNPo_n5uOERjosWp1aUh5NYaLJ6nMoPkx0.rYxkr1Et_EutOq6mA--", "site_full": "invezz.com", "site": "invezz.com", "site_section": "http://invezz.com/rss/invezz.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Invezz - The Investors' Portal", "title": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) sees further losses on Tuesday", "title_full": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) sees further losses on Tuesday", "published": "2018-05-22T12:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://invezz.com//uploads/story/30766/thumbs/bitcoinprice1_story_full.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0551774a638c90b1b67af42c48eb2c96a3471ed6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powc7S.5E5gPw01cBwrAlAMfQTac7FZykQ1ywpPGz1EZUdFkfnjW3QnYChpNPo_n5uOERjosWp1aUh5NYaLJ6nMoPkx0.rYxkr1Et_EutOq6mA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T12:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) sees further losses on Tuesday", "text": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) sees further losses on Tuesday Some crypto experts see new surge for BTC this year by Dimitar Bogdanov Tuesday, 22 May 2018, 10:04 BST\nThe Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) has edged lower in what is shaping up to be another disappointing session for the No. 1 digital coin.\nHaving opened yesterday’s trading at $8,522.33, the original cryptocurrency traded mostly sideways in the morning portion of the session. The situation changed in the afternoon, as the digital coin gradually declined to an intraday low of $8,365.12. It saw a small uptick in late trading, which allowed it to finish the day at $8,418.99.\nThe cryptocurrency has seen further losses in today’s trading, falling to as low as $8,298.91 in the early hours of the trading. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $8,330, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nDespite Bitcoin’s disappointing performance over the past week or so, some cryptocurrency observers expect the digital coin to experience big surge this year. Rodrigo Marques, chief executive officer of major Brazilian crypto trading platform Atlas Quantum, told MarketWatch on Monday that he expected Bitcoin to reach $20,000 in six months.\nLast week, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ head of research Tom Lee admitted that his forecast that Bitcoin would get a price boost during Coindesk’s Consensus 2018 blockchain conference had been wrong . Nevertheless, Fundstrat maintains its earlier forecast that the cryptocurrency’s price would hit $25,000 by the end of the year.\nIn other cryptocurrency-related news, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said yesterday that the agency would publish a staff advisory “providing guidance to exchanges and clearinghouses on certain enhancements when listing a derivative contract based on virtual currency”.\n“This advisory will reflect CFTC staff’s current thinking based on our growing experience with virtual currency derivatives. As new products are brought forth, staff will reevaluate and revisit the advisory, as necessary, to address any new and emerging issues,” Giancarlo said at the North American Securities Administrators Association Conference in Washington.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $8,335.19, as of 09:56 BST. The digital coin has lost $2.1% of its value in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagiancarlo46", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-headed-for-20000-in-six-months-says-ceo-of-cryptocurrency-platform-2018-05-21"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo marques", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:39:16.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5273bfbf213b8621729fad3d4017c75dc869c631", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiG805KWwLEXK5UxMLZZaB9FCawxynaBI7cykyuTYkfEJEnPu7es288WsSGl7XUpSRja.mce.X4Np", "site_full": "www.howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site": "howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site_section": "http://www.howbitcoinminingworks.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How Bitcoin Mining Works", "title": "Argentina's Banco Masventas has revealed that starting Monday it will enable customers to send cross-border payments using bitcoin.", "title_full": "Argentina's Banco Masventas has revealed that starting Monday it will enable customers to send cross-border payments using bitcoin.", "published": "2018-05-22T12:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5273bfbf213b8621729fad3d4017c75dc869c631", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiG805KWwLEXK5UxMLZZaB9FCawxynaBI7cykyuTYkfEJEnPu7es288WsSGl7XUpSRja.mce.X4Np", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mosquito Control (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T12:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Argentina's Banco Masventas has revealed that starting Monday it will enable customers to send cross-border payments using bitcoin.", "text": "\nhttps://ift.tt/2KLRq3R via /r/Bitcoin https://ift.tt/2s1Uh0R ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:09:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2011422062501d25c56198da9ee2a7fd28412066", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbwGIJ0fgDL81p0rTtfkV7w-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Can Ethereum rise like Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Can Ethereum rise like Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-22T12:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.039, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2011422062501d25c56198da9ee2a7fd28412066", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbwGIJ0fgDL81p0rTtfkV7w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "goolesby", "published": "2018-05-22T12:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Ethereum rise like Bitcoin?", "text": "Ethereum very likely to match the achievement of the Bitcoin.

The \"Operation Cryptosweep \" was presented during a Monday event organized by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Its existence was first reported by the financial media, and details were later presented in the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (TDCI) and the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB).\nCryptosweep, according to statements, includes \"almost 70 investigations and 35 pending or completed enforcement actions since the beginning of the month\". It is said that this number is expected to increase, although it is not clear when any related enforcement activities will be presented. The activity gained momentum when a task force composed of NASAA members was convened to initiate a coordinated series of ICO investigations and investment products related to cryptocurrencies. The NASAA representative refused to comment on the matter, but other participants in the operation presented a picture of extensive efforts to eliminate fraud. The latest example of state regulatory action was publicizing false support from celebrities such as actress Jennifer Aniston. \"The activities announced today are just the tip of the iceberg.\" - said in the statement deputy commissioner of TDCI, Frank Borger-Gilligan. Joseph Rotunda, director of the TSSB Enforcement Department, has a similar opinion: \"The investment market in cryptocurrencies is saturated with common scams, and our work only reveals the tip of the iceberg.\" - he said.\nIt looks like more countries are joining forces to prevent the frauds in the crypto-enthusiasts community, which means, the cryptocurrencies, tokens and ICO are now on a good way to being perceived as a serious branch of the economy by the general public.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. After a failure to break higher above the level of $8,570 the market is now sliding down towards the trend line support at the level of $8,132. There are still two scenarios available. So, it is still possible the last breakout was a fake one. In order to confirm the strength, the bulls would have to impulsively move towards the level of $8,900 without making a new low below the level of $7,887. Otherwise, the alternative scenario is still valid and indicates a possible drop towards the 61% Fibo at $7,712.

Mining them is 60% less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan, a leading crypto-currency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest Bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a Bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins Bitcoin.\n\"Their customers happen to be Bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a Bitcoin company,\" said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest Bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as Bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of Bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand, especially for high-end machines, was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for Bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40% this year, hurting margins for miners. The crypto-currency rose from $1 000 in January last year to more than $19 000 in December. Currently, one Bitcoin is worth about $8 400. Promised land\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a crypto-currency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto-currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing Bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in Bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37% of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCrypto-currency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: \"No matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you're still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports. Market test\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market; a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

The \"Operation Cryptosweep \" was presented during a Monday event organized by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Its existence was first reported by the financial media, and details were later presented in the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (TDCI) and the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB).\nCryptosweep, according to statements, includes \"almost 70 investigations and 35 pending or completed enforcement actions since the beginning of the month\". It is said that this number is expected to increase, although it is not clear when any related enforcement activities will be presented. The activity gained momentum when a task force composed of NASAA members was convened to initiate a coordinated series of ICO investigations and investment products related to cryptocurrencies. The NASAA representative refused to comment on the matter, but other participants in the operation presented a picture of extensive efforts to eliminate fraud. The latest example of state regulatory action was publicizing false support from celebrities such as actress Jennifer Aniston. \"The activities announced today are just the tip of the iceberg.\" - said in the statement deputy commissioner of TDCI, Frank Borger-Gilligan. Joseph Rotunda, director of the TSSB Enforcement Department, has a similar opinion: \"The investment market in cryptocurrencies is saturated with common scams, and our work only reveals the tip of the iceberg.\" - he said.\nIt looks like more countries are joining forces to prevent the frauds in the crypto-enthusiasts community, which means, the cryptocurrencies, tokens and ICO are now on a good way to being perceived as a serious branch of the economy by the general public.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. After a failure to break higher above the level of $8,570 the market is now sliding down towards the trend line support at the level of $8,132. There are still two scenarios available. So, it is still possible the last breakout was a fake one. In order to confirm the strength, the bulls would have to impulsively move towards the level of $8,900 without making a new low below the level of $7,887. Otherwise, the alternative scenario is still valid and indicates a possible drop towards the 61% Fibo at $7,712.\n Sebastian Seliga,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "north american securities administrators association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas state securities board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee department of commerce and insurance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united stat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:06:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b61cf7d6fda437166738b62818b0609401693fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQi9gXn_bDGqb7xeB1SeCeqfNBLGfBOAzQYsH9ZJF_.ZcAQRmSN_oT4eKO13XE.6X8U12n6f2GOoUm2rs8_jYUNwLbEiMqgNhGbwB77C5m8v7_e6Yguqg_zlE.FKnXHR14-", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Technology Intelligence", "title": "What is bitcoin, how does it work and what affects its price?", "title_full": "What is bitcoin, how does it work and what affects its price?", "published": "2018-05-22T11:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2017/05/02/TELEMMGLPICT000084440620-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOHNs0Y5vwBZmXiYbjSVrpM7XmmJZgo4teDp1qShbQr4.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 32, "comments": 0, "shares": 32}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b61cf7d6fda437166738b62818b0609401693fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQi9gXn_bDGqb7xeB1SeCeqfNBLGfBOAzQYsH9ZJF_.ZcAQRmSN_oT4eKO13XE.6X8U12n6f2GOoUm2rs8_jYUNwLbEiMqgNhGbwB77C5m8v7_e6Yguqg_zlE.FKnXHR14-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Telegraph Reporters", "published": "2018-05-22T11:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is bitcoin, how does it work and what affects its price?", "text": "Telegraph Reporters 7 June 2018 • 8:56am\nF ew technologies have the ability to stir passionate online debate and baffle the vast majority of the population as bitcoin .

For any answers to questions Contact Clyde Thorburn Here .\nInvest In Bitcoin And Other Types Of Crypto Currency And Crypto Coins By Joining The BitClub Network Author : Hugh Kimura 16 January 2018\nWhat is a Blockchain? Simply put, a blockchain is a database. However, there is one huge difference between how you probably currently think of a database and how a blockchain database works. In most cases, a traditional database sits on one computer or in one location. Even if a company has redundant servers around the world, the data might only be backed up between 3 to 5 locations. On top of that, these companies collectively spend billions of dollars a year on cyber security, to protect this data. With a blockchain database, the data can be backed up on potentially thousands of computers all over the world, for a much, much lower cost. The information in these databases is heavily encrypted and sometimes files are broken up into pieces, so even if one piece is exposed, it will not expose the entire file. If the information on one server does become compromised by hackers, the other copies of the databases have to “agree” that the compromised data was a legitimate change to the data. If the other copies do not agree, then the change is rejected and it is changed back to match the others. Obviously, this is an oversimplified explanation of the technology, but I hope that you are starting to see the benefits. Instead of just one point of failure, like on a single server, you now have multiple copies of the same database all over the world that is almost impossible to crack and will “fix” itself in the case of a hack.\nThis can also save a ton of money on cyber security software and services. Example. Let’s say that a hacker gets into your bank’s computer tomorrow and transfers all of your money to his account, then deletes any trace of the transaction. With today’s technology, you would probably be screwed. But with a blockchain currency like Bitcoin, if one server was hacked and a fake transaction was inserted into the database, then it wouldn’t match the transaction record on the hundreds other copies of the database. This transaction would be seen as a fake and rejected. Your money would be safe. This is one of the many reasons why blockchain technology is so exciting. The Characteristics Of A Currency To Be Aware Of. Although cryptocurrencies are all based on blockchain technology, they are not all created equal. Here are some differences that you need to understand to make informed trading decisions. Transaction processing speed. Total supply currently available. Will there ultimately be a limit on the total number of currency available? Will there be an unlimited supply of currency? Is there a real-world need for this software/currency? Real world adoption of the technology. Any big investors in the project? Does the use of the software make sense? Do the founders have a reputable background? These are just a few of the characteristics that you should look at.\nHowever, once you start digging into these details, you will begin to see which projects could work for their intended purpose and which ones are probably scams. This understanding will also allow you to assess the long-term viability of these different currencies and which ones will be more desirable in the future. Example. Tether is a cryptocurrency that wants to be the proxy for fiat currencies. So there is a Tether USD version, EUR version, etc. But each one is pegged to the value of the currency, so you can never make any money trading it. It is purely to provide stable and liquid transactions. So one USD Tether will always be worth about $1. If you didn’t know this and bought a bunch of it, thinking that it’s cheap compared to Bitcoin, you will tie up your money in an asset that will never appreciate. Sure, you won’t lose money either, but you would have lost out on other opportunities. So understand the nuances of each crypto, it’s very important. What are the Different Cryptocurrency Use Cases? Almost every currency software has a different intended purpose and individual implementation, with inherent strengths and weaknesses. It’s like Windows vs Mac. …or iOS vs Android. Here are a few examples of the different types of cryptocurrencies and what they are designed to do. This is not an exhaustive list, just a sample. Note. I don’t necessarily support these currencies, I’m just using them as examples of the different use case niches within cryptocurrencies.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:51:41.059+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51df7e0a8fa4dbd05d24247ea8edbc87930a3592", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPtPIVqa.kNX8vkpOw40XlJECQgI1LfwIk2Ep466kbruQ5DCF5l2nIfiIak_6eUtHiExxtVxqKCIPxw6oY8W62B0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Nobel-Winning Economist Schiller: Bitcoin Could Be Another Failed Monetary Experiment : btc", "title_full": "Nobel-Winning Economist Schiller: Bitcoin Could Be Another Failed Monetary Experiment : btc", "published": "2018-05-22T10:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.228, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51df7e0a8fa4dbd05d24247ea8edbc87930a3592", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPtPIVqa.kNX8vkpOw40XlJECQgI1LfwIk2Ep466kbruQ5DCF5l2nIfiIak_6eUtHiExxtVxqKCIPxw6oY8W62B0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Blockchainicopress", "published": "2018-05-22T10:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobel-Winning Economist Schiller: Bitcoin Could Be Another Failed Monetary Experiment : btc", "text": "submitted by /u/Blockchainicopress\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bitssurfer.com/2018/05/21/nobel-winning-economist-shiller-bitcoin-could-be-another-failed-monetary-experiment/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:59:49.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14d5501dc1f93ba3cb624ca1a7e219522ae67d3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu.hVYzrlqKXGv1Rrn4ivnkUuyIQKgyY27mObAXu2.icyvs7SLyYiTHRj_MICGUoq_Y4LOQwTJe0e63sa7b4Y56EkjaqJFwjqM-", "site_full": "mypr.co.za", "site": "mypr.co.za", "site_section": "http://mypr.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "africa"], "section_title": "MyPR", "title": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 3", "title_full": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 3", "published": "2018-05-22T10:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/YgqF0JIAc1U/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14d5501dc1f93ba3cb624ca1a7e219522ae67d3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu.hVYzrlqKXGv1Rrn4ivnkUuyIQKgyY27mObAXu2.icyvs7SLyYiTHRj_MICGUoq_Y4LOQwTJe0e63sa7b4Y56EkjaqJFwjqM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "clydethorburn", "published": "2018-05-22T10:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 3", "text": "You are here: Home / Banking and Financial Services / Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 3 Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 3 (MyPR.co.za) By clydethorburn Filed Under: Banking and Financial Services\nIf you want to purchase Bitcoin as an investment and you want to join the BitClub Network Company, so that BitClub can mine Bitcoin and other Crypto Currency on your behalf to grow a stable and increasing investment for you, please join BitClub for free at http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn .

Simply put, a blockchain is a database. However, there is one huge difference between how you probably currently think of a database and how a blockchain database works. In most cases, a traditional database sits on one computer or in one location. Even if a company has redundant servers around the world, the data might only be backed up between 3 to 5 locations. On top of that, these companies collectively spend billions of dollars a year on cyber security, to protect this data. With a blockchain database, the data can be backed up on potentially thousands of computers all over the world, for a much, much lower cost. The information in these databases is heavily encrypted and sometimes files are broken up into pieces, so even if one piece is exposed, it will not expose the entire file. If the information on one server does become compromised by hackers, the other copies of the databases have to “agree” that the compromised data was a legitimate change to the data. If the other copies do not agree, then the change is rejected and it is changed back to match the others. Obviously, this is an oversimplified explanation of the technology, but I hope that you are starting to see the benefits. Instead of just one point of failure, like on a single server, you now have multiple copies of the same database all over the world that is almost impossible to crack and will “fix” itself in the case of a hack.\nThis can also save a ton of money on cyber security software and services. Example. Let’s say that a hacker gets into your bank’s computer tomorrow and transfers all of your money to his account, then deletes any trace of the transaction. With today’s technology, you would probably be screwed.

CoinGate: LN ‘Without Doubt Most Awaited Bitcoin Network Upgrade’ In a post on Reddit, CoinGate, which has operated since 2014 but saw over half its transaction volume this year , confirmed it was operating LN in a “sandbox environment” while “intense testing” continues. “Lightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,” officials wrote. …In the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech. A lesser-known payment processor, CoinGate has sought to adhere to the latest technological innovations and best practices in Bitcoin, batching transactions since 2015 and implementing SegWit support in December last year. By Contrast, larger operators such as BitPay and Coinbase have become known for the slow rate with which they adopt new technology. Despite only existing as a Bitcoin mainnet implementation since the start of 2018, LN has meanwhile already attracted a considerable number of ardent supporters , both business and private. Lightning Crosses 2000 Nodes CoinGate joins a select few to provide support for the protocol, which remains in a testing phase without guarantees of funds security. In February, Bitcoinist reported , Blockstream opened a dedicated LN shop, a move which at the time attracted criticism due to Lightning’s volatile – or experimental – nature. For its sandbox effort, CoinGate has appealed for test users to accept Bitcoin payments, while acknowledging the technology’s potential pitfalls. “[T]here will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment,” the Reddit post adds. Last week, LN passed 2000 reachable nodes, while current network capacity is just over $163,000. At the same time, a comparison surfaced which drew attention to the considerable cost savings merchants can gain using Lightning over credit card payments.

Others say the OG crypto opens up communistic possibilities. Going beyond either camp, Bitcoin Unlimited Chief Scientist Peter Rizun has posited bitcoin will egg humanity toward transcending both systems. Also see: Can’t Blame ‘Em: Google Recruiter Politely Pings Vitalik Buterin Subscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts Rizun: BTC ‘Neither Capitalistic Nor Communistic’ Bitsonline caught up with Rizun a few weeks ago at the 2018 Satoshi Vision Conference, and since then, the Bitcoin Unlimited Chief Scientist has been doing some light reading. Well, not light reading, rather some heady reading. Noting as much on Twitter, Rizun’s been digging through with anthropologist David Graeber’s book The Utopia of Rules , a treatise on how bureaucratic structures affect human relations. Getting halfway through the book got Rizun’s mind churning on bitcoin and the transformative political future — one beyond both capitalism and communism — that it seemingly portends: 1/3: Bitcoin is neither capitalistic nor communistic, but a new form of economic communication with the power to disintermediate the immense bureaucracies that both capitalism and communism came to rely on. — Peter R. Rizun (@PeterRizun) May 21, 2018 As such, Rizun thinks the original cryptocurrency is going to open up entirely new political and economical possibilities for humanity: 2/3: With the disintermediation of the bureau, the structural violence that maintains our current economic systems and social structures will begin to lose its power over our imaginations. — Peter R. Rizun (@PeterRizun) May 21, 2018 3/3: And with our imaginations freed, entirely new economic and social systems will be born that we cannot even begin to imagine today. — Peter R. Rizun (@PeterRizun) May 21, 2018 Whether you agree or disagree with Rizun, it’s clear that the rise of cryptocurrencies are part of, and even authorized by, increased societal concerns about the pitfalls of centralization — that very lifeblood of bureaucratic violence. What Would That Future Look Like? Rizun didn’t immediately respond to my request for comment, and I will update this article if he does, but it’s safe to assume he has a long-term timeline in mind when he tweets about such transformative possibilities. Rome wasn’t built in a day, as it were. But Rizun’s suggestion of bitcoin-driven “social systems … we cannot even begin to imagination today” gets the more curious among us imagining, well, today . Rizun at the 2017 Future of Bitcoin conference. So what could such systems look like? Considering that bitcoin opens up radical possibilities of decentralization, perhaps the schools of thought most prepared to contend with such a future are the anarcho-traditions, however disparate they may be. That’s because no other schools of thought have decentralization at their cores in the same way as these anarcho-traditions. Maybe the future, then, will be a place where we don’t need leaders to tell us how to live among each other. Sounds like a future worth working toward. What’s your take? Do you agree or disagree with Rizun’s assertions here? Let us know in the comments below.

His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud. Also Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Stealing Even From the Moon According to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of “fresh” credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers. Halmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone. Apparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: “We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.” 1,071 BTC Seized According to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him. In addition, Halmi acted consistently to disguise his identity by technological means, made many money transfers between different Bitcoin wallets for the purpose of covering his tracks, used online masking services to distance himself from his various accounts, and recorded parts of his property in the name of his relatives. The Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office attributes to the defendant money laundering of at least 1,071 BTC, estimated at NIS 31,000,000. During the interrogation, in a precedent-setting move, the defendant’s Bitcoin wallet was seized and the amount found in it was transferred to a police wallet. The State Prosecutor’s Office intends to confiscate all the contents of the defendant’s Bitcoin wallets, if and when he is convicted. The case was investigated by investigators of the Israeli national cyber unit at Lahav 433. The offenses with which Halmi is charged are: credit card fraud under aggravated circumstances (multiple offenses), receiving a thing fraudulently under aggravated circumstances, providing means for committing a crime, violating the Computers Law and money laundering.

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future. Sauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny. For a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , “there are a lot more regulatory requirements,” according to McGill. While many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh , director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance on which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency’s full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency. The SEC has gone after what McGill called “ low-hanging fruit .” These are the “pump-and-dump” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO . The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors. Outside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants: \"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn't exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,” said McGill. CFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator? In late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure. Not being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions. But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice . Even if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation ( Monex ). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior. “An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.” Speaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself. Contract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated If reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed. Swaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to. \"Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.\" “Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter. TeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold. Sauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets. “One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That's part of the reason why we're seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.” Another reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.” How Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected The implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.” It can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it. “Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.” \"There's clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.” By this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen. \"CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you're going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.\" Weighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued. Will bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency. \"From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don't think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.\" Another factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition. \"Now you're going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,\" said McGill. “You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter. On New Competition and Shorting Though the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future. Tendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.” “We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “ Musakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.” Added to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, “even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.” The ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.” “It’s going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,” stated McGill. “It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.” This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Smart contracts are coming to Bitcoin The world of smart contracts has emerged in recent years and is disrupting how modern business and trade are conducted across the globe. These self-executing virtual agreements have been popularized by Ethereum, but developers quickly saw the potential to enable them on the most famous blockchain platform as well: Bitcoin. While the traditional purpose of Bitcoin is to establish itself as a payment alternative, the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to its ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability. RSK is therefore the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency, thanks to a 2-Way Peg system that ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). iExec’s smart contracts deployed on RSK Meanwhile, iExec is developing the first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network. This marketplace allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications. iExec’s technology relies on Ethereum smart contracts and allows the building of a virtual cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand. However, decentralized apps will ultimately rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains, which has led iExec to adopt a blockchain-agnostic stance. RSK will allow developers around the globe to create decentralized personal and corporate solutions that work in the safest and most popular blockchain protocol, with low transaction costs that fit an ample range of needs. For these reasons, iExec has successfully deployed its V1 smart contracts on RSK as well. This SDK allows developers to build applications that will benefit from scalable and free cloud computing capabilities. The next steps of the partnership On May 29, 2018, iExec will release its V2, the most-awaited component of iExec. This release consists of a decentralized marketplace for trading cloud resources and marks the very beginning of the possibility of monetizing one’s cloud resources in a peer-to-peer market. Once V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. About RSK RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability. About iExec iExec aims to decentralize the cloud computing market by building the future of the Internet infrastructure. We are developing the first blockchain cloud computing platform, to support the most compute-intensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, big data, fintech, cryptography, or 3D rendering.

Overall, we didn’t witness the huge gains from past years. Following low to average trading volume days, Bitcoin is still fighting to stay on top the $8,400 support level. We can see on the following chart that moving average 50 days is also supporting Bitcoin in these levels, as well as the ascending trend line. From the bull side, the next major resistance level is at $8,900 – $9,000 – where the MA-200 lies. Afterwards – the next obstacle will be $9,400 resistance. From the bear side, Breaking down the $8,400 will test $8,200 and then $7,800. BTC/USD BitFinex 4 Hours chart The post Bitcoin Price Analysis May.21 appeared first on CryptoPotato .
