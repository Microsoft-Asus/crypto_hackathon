Based in Dalston (Hackney), East London, Shackwell Lane Mosque is the UK’s first Turkish-owned mosque, managed by the registered charity UK Turkish Islamic Trust. CCN spoke with the mosque chairman Erkin Guney, the mosque’s Islamic advisor Zayd al Khair, and Gurmit Singh, the founder of tech company Combo Innovations who will be handling the process. Singh suggested to Guney that the mosque could benefit from accepting cryptocurrencies as Zakat is mandatory and many Muslims use cryptocurrencies, although few charities accept them. Guney told CCN: “So that’s when the conversation at the mosque started. We soon realized this was relatively uncharted water.” Guney found a handful of UK charities accepting crypto as donations, one of which was Muslim. “There were a couple of mosques abroad that also announced they were going to accept cryptocurrency. It looks like we may be the first in Britain to do so.” Local banks weren’t in a position to advise the mosque on the situation, but Gurmit Singh, who has been involved in the cryptocurrency space for years, stepped in as an advisor free of charge. He pointed out that the issue of what does and does not constitute money in the Muslim faith is a contentious one, with Bitcoin and other cryptos currently a hot topic of debate among Islamic scholars . Usury (lending at high rates of interest) is haram, forbidden, as are currencies not backed by commodities unless widely accepted by society. Singh made the following points to CCN: “Would we have had the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, Black Wednesday in 1992, Black Monday in 1987, and the granddaddy of them all, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, if speculation was not standard practice in our conventional, Western banking system? From a financial prospective, the ethical aspects of an Islamic blockchain-enabled economy can help bring it into the 21st Century. The technology can enable global penetration, reaching people that currently have limited access to traditional financing, yet have a smartphone. We believe the model will appeal to non-Muslims too.” The mosque’s religious advisers concluded that cryptocurrencies can be accepted as donations, and the mosque has added Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their website to accept Zakat and Sadaqah. Guney told CCN: “The zakat will be used to feed the poor in our local community and help others in need. We will also put a portion aside to help with the urgent renovations needed at the mosque. Inshallah (God willing) the cryptocurrency campaign is a success and we do receive donations. If it works, I’m sure many other mosques and Islamic charities, not just in Britain but worldwide, will start doing the same.” The mosque’s main Islamic advisor is Zayd al Khair, who has a Masters in History and Religious studies and is pursuing a PhD after traveling throughout Africa and Saudi Arabia studying the Islamic faith. CCN interviewed Mr al Khair about the issue of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Mr al Khair told CCN: “With the growing usage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there has been an upsurge in discussions among Islamic scholars about their permissibility. Initially, several voiced negative views due to the lack of regulation, and the speculation around their value and origin. However, many scholars adopted a neutral stance, believing these digital currencies are too new to form a clear view on whether they violate fundamental Islamic principles or not. More recently, a few scholars have also started advocating the use of cryptocurrencies.” Masjid Ramadan, the Shackwell Lane Mosque, is hosting a talk on Monday 21 May at 11:00 am GMT to discuss cryptocurrencies and inform attendants of their potential use.

Over the past 24 hours, the capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has fallen from 390 billion to 373 billion USD, the entire digital currency market has lost more than 17 billion US dollars per day. Bitcoin price fell below $8200 and at Wall-Street start is traded at $8177, and the price of the second most important digital currency – Ethereum dropped below $670. The current correction of the cryptocurrency market and the decline in prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major digital currencies may be related to three main factors: the tax policy at the Bitfinex exchange, the scandal over South Korea's two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb, and the large sale-off by the investment fund MT.Gox.\nLast week, the Bitfinex team said that the financial regulator of British Columbia (offshore exchange jurisdiction) is able to exchange information with the tax authorities of the country where the Exchange customer resides. In addition, the exchange intends to provide all the necessary information at the request of the regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of the British Virgin Islands. Immediately after that news, large corporate clients of the exchange publicly stated that they stop using Bitfinex for their trading operations and are going to withdraw funds from trading accounts.\nCryptocurrency sales at Bitfinex and crypto transfers to fiats was one of the main factors that contributed to the market decline last week.\nThe South Korean cryptocurrency market is only beginning to recover after the scandal around UPbit, which became known on May 11.\nThe cryptocurrency market is likely to recover from the situation at Bitfinex quickly. Large investors will be able to use other crypto exchanges to reopen longs and buy a digital currency. As for the South Korean exchanges, this is the question of time that is necessary for the return of clients' trust to the exchanges, even if there have been no proofs of client funds disappearance from exchange client accounts.\nAs for a technical point of view, the situation has not changed - the Bitcoin market continues a downward impulse towards the nearest support. The nearest significant support is located at $7700-$7900. Friday's minimum on May 18 is at $7890. This might serve as a zone of demand.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall-street", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bithumb", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T16:51:55.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "555ae956b6cac8a828587125f6bb0c681a07654d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9L4DFOJpWLtMDBKvQJlzYMNQcSDwwXXtxoDNyoXF3_yeHkUS1OPen89Ne4BkHCrUY.3el4xhpmLgBNIALpXpotCvBxfXlR.5TRumkPztFjnvnfE2lQnko1TYX5i_pkUWw-", "site_full": "www.heute.at", "site": "heute.at", "site_section": "http://www.heute.at/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Heute", "title": "Bitcoins brauchen so viel Strom wie ganz Österreich - News", "title_full": "Bitcoins brauchen so viel Strom wie ganz Österreich - News | heute.at", "published": "2018-05-22T16:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "news", "country": "AT", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://www.heute.at/images/content/5/6/1/56150244/9/teaserbreit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29268, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "555ae956b6cac8a828587125f6bb0c681a07654d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9L4DFOJpWLtMDBKvQJlzYMNQcSDwwXXtxoDNyoXF3_yeHkUS1OPen89Ne4BkHCrUY.3el4xhpmLgBNIALpXpotCvBxfXlR.5TRumkPztFjnvnfE2lQnko1TYX5i_pkUWw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "heute.at", "published": "2018-05-22T16:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoins brauchen so viel Strom wie ganz Österreich - News", "text": "Wie viel Strom genau die Herstellung der Kryptowδhrung Bitcoin verbraucht, ist nicht leicht auszurechnen.

Bis Ende 2018 sollen bereits 7,7 Gigawatt verwendet werden  das ist der Gesamtverbrauch von Φsterreich oder ein halbes Prozent des weltweiten Energieverbrauchs.\nZum Vergleich: Alle Solaranlagen weltweit erzeugten 2016 gut ein Prozent des globalen Strombedarfs.\n42.000 Kilowattstunden pro Bitcoin\nDerzeit brauche es etwa 42.000 Kilowattstunden um einen Bitcoin zu schaffen - aber nur, falls Hochleistungscomputer mit guten Kόhlsystemen eingesetzt werden, sagte De Vries dem deutschen Magazin Der Spiegel . Sonst sei der Wert noch hφher.\nNoch ein Vergleich: Ein Durchschnittshaushalt verbraucht im Jahr 3.500 Kilowattstunden.\nDie Berechnung\nWie kommt De Vries auf seine Zahlen? Es sei φffentlich bekannt, wie groί die gesamte Rechenleistung fόr Bitcoin-Mining ist - und wie viel Strom der effizienteste Prozessor, der auf dem Markt ist, bei einer bestimmten Rechenleistung verbrauche. Daraus lasse sich errechnen, wie groί der Energiebedarf des Systems mindestens sein mόsse, erklδrt der Φkonom, der bei der Beratungsfirma PricewaterhouseCooper arbeitet.\nDe Vries hat in seiner Studie ein Best-Case-Szenario angenommen - also wie hoch der Stromverbrauch ausfδllt, wenn alle eingesetzten Prozessoren das beste auf dem Markt erhδltliche System nutzten. Der tatsδchliche Verbrauch dόrfte also noch hφher sein.\nHier die Studie von Alex de Vries.\n(GP)\nThemen Φsterreich Wδhrung", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

No other date, save for January 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the genesis block, is more symbolic. It was on May 22, 2010 that Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Eight years on, the occasion has become part of bitcoin’s mythology.\nAlso read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition Remembering the $83 Million Pizza\nOn May 18 2009, Laszlo posted a thread on the Bitcointalk forum entitled “Pizza for bitcoins?” In it, he explained: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”\nLaszlo then went on to list his favorite toppings, before specifying “just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that”. Within days he had a buyer and the deal went through on May 22. The event is symbolic, not so much for the value of those 10,000 BTC today, but because it marked one of the first public instances of bitcoin being used as a means of payment. The pizza thread, like the value of BTC, has since grown and grown, and today runs to 73 pages, having been viewed around 750,000 times. Pizza Wallets and Pizza Moon Missions\nEvery year on May 22 the bitcoin community now competes to despatch the best pizza tweets and branded products, all tied to that then-minor but now massive day in 2010 when bitcoin proved its worth. It hasn’t stopped proving it ever since. To mark the occasion today, Bitstamp has calculated how far $83m of pizzas would stretch, using the following formula:\n10,000 BTC * 8,400 USD (1 BTC) = 84 million USD 84 million USD / 15 USD (1 pizza price) = 5.6 million pizzas 5.6 million pizzas * 14 inches (diameter of a large pizza) = 1237 miles 1237 miles / 248 miles (average altitude of the ISS) = 4.9 PIZZA TO THE MOON: In 2010, a Florida man bought two large pizzas for 10.000 #Bitcoin . Today, this could buy you enough pizzas to get to the International Space Station five times. #whenmoon Happy #BitcoinPizzaDay ! #BTC #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OuPeXC93CM\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 22, 2018\nHardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has gone one better, creating a limited edition Pizza Day Nano S. Just 1,337 of the units will be issued, each coming in a special Laszlo’s Pizza box complete with a sachet of red chilli pepper oil, for those who like to spice up their cold storage.\nAs for the man who made this infamous anniversary come about, history records that Laszlo sold most of his bitcoins at around $1 apiece but, having contributed to its early source code, and done his bit to ensure real world adoption, he regrets nothing. In the crypto community, Laszlo Hanyecz’s actions will always be the ultimate “Florida man” story, destined to be commemorated faithfully every May 22 forevermore.\nWould you buy a limited edition Pizza Day wallet?

With BTC prices circling $8,200 , the price of one of the legendary pizzas purchased on this day in 2010 is now worth $41.4 mln . Traditionally accompanied by various social media events, giveaways from cryptocurrency businesses and a considerable amount of pizza-eating, Bitcoin Pizza Day remembers May 22, 2010 – the first time a Bitcoin user purchased pizza with the cryptocurrency. On that date, Bitcoin traded at around $0.004, making the two pizzas Laszlo Hanyecz ordered from Papa John’s for 10,000 BTC cost $41. A ceremonial occurrence in Bitcoin’s history, Hanyecz’s fateful transaction has garnered more admiration than ridicule. Commentators later noted that without such pioneering usage, Bitcoin would not have scaled to the phenomenon it is in 2018. “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later,” Hanyecz wrote on Bitcointalk in 2010, attempting to find support for the transaction. The famous post continues: “You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!” Responses to the original post from November 2010 make for equally interesting reading, users asking Hanyecz what it felt like to eat pizza now worth $2,600 and wondering whether the order would ever become the “world’s first million-dollar pizza.” This year, meanwhile, community infographics accompany celebrations from crypto businesses, including exchange BTCC , which noted the sliding scale of expenditure on its annual pizza delivery. It’s #Pizza #Day at #BTCC ! Fun fact: We spent 2.00 BTC on pizzas for the office in 2016, last year we spent 0.40 BTC, and this year we spent just 0.09 #BTC .

Pero ellos son una compaĂąĂa de microchips, no una compaĂąĂa de criptomonedasâ€, dijo una de las fuentes. Ambos rechazaron ser citados, dado que la informaciĂłn sobre el debut bursĂĄtil todavĂa no se ha hecho pĂşblica.\nLa salida a bolsa de Canaan, que dice ser el segundo proveedor de hardware de minerĂa de criptomonedas del mundo, estĂĄ prevista para julio, dijeron las fuentes. Canaan rechazĂł hacer comentarios.\nLos beneficios de la compaĂąĂa con sede en PekĂn se multiplicaron por siete el aĂąo pasado a 361 millones yuanes (56,67 millones de dĂłlares), segĂşn el prospecto de la salida a bolsa, ya que el elevado precio del bitcoin provocĂł un aumento de la demanda de sus productos, vendidos bajo la marca AvalonMiner.\nPero los efectos de volatilidad del bitcoin y los crecientes costes de la minerĂa de los mismos se pueden ver en las tiendas de Sham Shui Po, a unos kilĂłmetros del centro financiero de Hong Kong, donde ha sido remitida la documentaciĂłn de la salida a bolsa.\nLas empresas que venden plataformas mineras allĂ dijeron que la demanda â€“ especialmente para mĂĄquinas de alta gama â€“ avanzaba con dificultad.\nEl cambio ha sido repentino. Hace tan sĂłlo unos meses, la demanda de equipos de minerĂa de bitcoins en Sham Shui Po estaba en auge.\nLos precios de las criptomonedas han caĂdo un 40 por ciento este aĂąo, afectando a los mĂĄrgenes de los mineros. La criptomoneda subiĂł de 1.000 dĂłlares en enero el aĂąo pasado a mĂĄs de 19.000 dĂłlares en diciembre. Actualmente, un bitcoin estĂĄ valorado en alrededor de 8.400 dĂłlares.\nFuente: https://ift.tt/2KLLFD8", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T12:03:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "413e3b55537df3f5c307e195f3c2cb38881ec022", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihrZds4lcTnvClZEq9w1xt8Tynfhj3rnKwbRlcH3rJd5OIM9UYmND8To", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com", "site": "freelancer.com", "site_section": "https://www.freemarket.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["job_search", "hobbies_and_interests", "jobs", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freemarket.com - New Projects", "title": "bitcoin app api help", "title_full": "bitcoin app api help", "published": "2018-05-22T16:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1547, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "413e3b55537df3f5c307e195f3c2cb38881ec022", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihrZds4lcTnvClZEq9w1xt8Tynfhj3rnKwbRlcH3rJd5OIM9UYmND8To", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T16:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin app api help", "text": "Android bitcoin app api help\nHi, my app developer told me his computer crashed and to look for some else.

All most everyone related to this crypto is asking only one question! What will be the future status of bitcoin in 2018? Well, first of all, there is no direct answers to that question. But many experts are seeing the upcoming future in many different ways.\nBTC First of all, one prediction is taking the number one place. And that thing comes from the investors. That is really a bit of shocker and it is: Bitcoin investors are expecting that this king crypto can reach up to near 50K in this lucky year numbered 2018! which will be the doubles of the highest rise in the history(2017) !!\nBTC Here is the number two magical statement, which has come from the magical mouth of a group of the financial analyst (AMSYS group) and they are predicting that Bitcoin will break the resistant level of 30K USD in this running year!! They also mentioned that they have been checking this stats for more than 12 months and what they had discovered is really shocking. \"There is a significant level of demand and supply imbalance in the current price level\". They predict that this imbalance can cause something devastating. From there another analysis, they had mentioned that a lot more money is going to come into this year, which will be the record-breaking amount.\nHere is the latest bomb, which has been launched from another bitcoin expert Bobby Lee , the man behind one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the world,\nsays that \"Bitcoin? 1 Million Baby\"\nWell, that was a lot of saying about the unseen future. But sometimes, predictions are likely to be matched. So whats your thoughts on bitcoin guys?

They are planning to hire programmers who will be working on the settlement of the blockchain project and focused on explaining why BCH is valuable for e-commerce.\nAbout 1-5% of each block reward is being considered, however, the committee has not come up with any agreed numbers. 1% of the block reward roughly connects to about $650,000 only if the Bitcoin cash [BCH] prices are above $1,200 per coin, so the funding would take place accordingly.\nBitcoin Cash is now applicable to buy products on Amazon, making it one of the leading cryptocurrency in retail and e-commerce spaces. In December, last year, the company started paying its employees with Bitcoin Cash.\nJihan Wu, the Co-founder of BITMAIN tweeted last year saying:\n“BCH community needs to learn a hard lesson. Befriend with other competing coins, learn from them, and make BCH better. Don’t play hatred, don’t wish competing coins ill. Just wish to try making BCH better.”\nThis year, the recent upgrade also features several operation codes that now allow higher transaction output. At the conference, it was discussed that funds will be collected through miners’ rewards as a new proposal where the miners agree on voting for it.\nCalvin Ayre, the Founder and Chairman of Ayre Group who hosted the Coingeek Conference tweeted:\n“Now that smart contracts exist on BCH there is no need to go anywhere else for application development.”\nMining pool representatives from Bitcoin.com and other projects agreed to support the proposal for miners to vote for raising funds on community initiatives. It is important for the votes to cross a 75% threshold with amounts received from each block that’s found.

According to research published in the journal Joule, the same amount of electricity used in one Bitcoin transaction could power the average Dutch household for a month. The study says the Bitcoin network currently consumes 2.55 gigawatts of electricity, nearly the same as Ireland.\nBy the end of 2018, the study predicts predicts that number rise to 7.8 gigawatts. Bitcoin transactions require massive computational power, and thereby large amounts of electricity to function.\nComputers in the decentralized Bitcoin network calculating transactions compete every 10 minutes to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nKnown as Bitcoin mining, this process sees the winning hardware get 12.5 bitcoins, or around $100,000. However, as Bitcoin calculations become more difficult to solve people employing more computational power have a higher chance of winning.\nThe problem with this, study author Alex Devries explained to Gizmodo, is that the process motivates participants in the network to use more hardware, and as a result more power.. 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T16:46:50.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f60e92174c0b0e3cc32b9b4a7a170afabde5f53e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYvNcn2RnUd8hVlA.FngPhc6Qm2aro5Jtt5UjAWDOGnPgOlJqBoikZcIZZMWZU0rFIUQ.sxWL5yYMl2zEglAg1L.uvMZRZjpfJ1PbXZZZ0ydSM7m_x2h6u", "site_full": "www.onenewspage.co.uk", "site": "onenewspage.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.onenewspage.co.uk/rss/latest/Press+Releases.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Press Releases News on One News Page [United Kingdom]", "title": "Bitcoin mining usage may consume 0.5% of world's electricity", "title_full": "Bitcoin mining usage may consume 0.5% of world's electricity", "published": "2018-05-22T16:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://video.newsserve.net/v/20180521/1805210652-Bitcoin-mining-usage-may-consume-of_hires.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f60e92174c0b0e3cc32b9b4a7a170afabde5f53e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYvNcn2RnUd8hVlA.FngPhc6Qm2aro5Jtt5UjAWDOGnPgOlJqBoikZcIZZMWZU0rFIUQ.sxWL5yYMl2zEglAg1L.uvMZRZjpfJ1PbXZZZ0ydSM7m_x2h6u", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T16:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin mining usage may consume 0.5% of world's electricity", "text": "A study has found that by the end of this year, bitcoin mining could be using as much as half a per...

For example, Propy is based on the Ethereum blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around, while also representing the ownership of property. Ultimately, this enables title deed transfers to take place entirely online. Imagine a world where you can buy or sell your property while sitting on your couch – now this is a reality with blockchain technology, Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://tokensale.propy.com/&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Propy&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;, told me.&l;/span&g;&l;/blockquote&g;\nAccording to Karayaneva, the only way to encourage homebuyers and sellers to take advantage of cryptocurrency for real estate transactions is to take a &a;ldquo;cryptoeconomics&a;rdquo; approach, which goes much further than simply putting homes up for sale in Bitcoin.\nCryptoeconomics lays out the framework for the way in which cryptocurrency ecosystems thrive and function across a decentralized network, known as the blockchain. These ecosystems are able to allow a number of entities who do not know one another to reliably reach consensus across an anonymous, trustworthy network through the use of cryptocurrencies. This is achieved by using a combination of economic incentives and basic cryptographic tools.\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;&a;ldquo;Cryptoeconomics is like mechanism design. It starts with the desired end goal and works backwards to find the right set of mechanisms to align with the incentives of all participants in the system, to bring forth a common goal,&a;rdquo; said Karl Floerch, a core researcher for &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.ethereum.org/foundation&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;the Ethereum Foundation&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;For example, the international real estate marketplace, Propy, applies cryptoeconomics by &l;/span&g;&l;i&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;incentivizing&l;/span&g;&l;/i&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; individual users to join the Propy platform to list properties, share properties on social media, upload title history into the system and more.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;&a;ldquo;Users on the Propy platform are rewarded with blockchain tokens that serve as &a;ldquo;coupons&a;rdquo; for the use of the platform&a;rsquo;s services, while they are easily tradable online to other perspective users that want to obtain access to the services. Users have in their hands a secure, easy-to-use, comprehensive way for completing their real estate transactions,&a;rdquo; Karayaneva said. &l;/span&g;\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Users who list properties, share these listings on social media and upload title history on the network, are fueled by Propy&a;rsquo;s &a;ldquo;PRO&a;rdquo; tokens (ERC-20 tokens), which are designed to be used for unlocking smart contracts for title transfers in the Propy Registry. In other words, ownership transfer is happening entirely online and is secured by blockchain technology. &l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Moreover, the token economics approach in the real estate industry is also intended to incentivize title &a;ldquo;miners&a;rdquo; and government agencies adoption, encouraging widespread&a;nbsp;use of digital tokens for every participant involved in the process.&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;&l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;. &l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;For example, the state of Vermont just &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-vermont-city-tests-blockchain-technology-for-property-deals-1517351207&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;announced&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; the launch of a pilot project with Propy to utilize blockchain technology to record real estate conveyance documents. The pilot demonstrates how blockchain technology can secure real estate transactions by storing land management data across a blockchain-based network.&l;/span&g;\n&l;blockquote&g;The announcement of a pilot project to utilize blockchain technology in real estate transactions is emblematic of Vermont&a;rsquo;s long history of innovating business, insurance, and financial technology. We are fortunate to have a cutting-edge statutory framework that enables the use of blockchain technology, and we will continue to work with the legislature to ensure Vermont remains at the forefront of these innovations, said Michael Schirling, the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary.&l;/blockquote&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Moreover, blockchain&a;rsquo;s growing presence in the real estate industry can provide a solution for creating more efficient cross-border transactions. Between 2009 and 2016, &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/198667-0&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;demand for cross-border real estate transactions increased from $65 billion to $217 billion.&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; Chinese citizens are currently among the largest groups of foreign investors in the U.S. real estate market, owning over $28 billion in U.S. residential properties. However, the total value of the U.S. residential real estate market is over $29 trillion.

Law enforcement agencies often see them as a criminal tool used to buy drugs, guns or other illegal items ; financial regulatory bodies can’t decide whether to classify them a security; and a handful of states have proposed legislation that would allow their constituents to pay their taxes with them.\nBut this regulatory uncertainty hasn’t stopped Brian Forde, a California Democrat running for the US House of Representatives, from accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin in the lead up to the 2018 elections. Forde’s embrace of Bitcoin makes sense: He was a senior advisor to the Obama administration on cryptocurrencies and other digital technologies, and headed up MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.\nIn 2014, the Federal Election Commission ruled it was okay for political action committees to accept donations in Bitcoin . Nevertheless, Dave Min, another Democrat vying for the same congressional seat, picked up on Forde’s crypto affiliations and used them as the basis for an attack ad. It is likely the first political ad in the US to mention Bitcoin.\nIn a copy of the ad provided to Motherboard by the Forde campaign, Forde’s face is superimposed over some footage of a stereotypical hacker typing on screens of streaming green code. A woman’s voice cites “Brian Forde’s big donors” as “Bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nMin, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, did not respond to my request for comment. Forde, who has raised over $100,000 in campaign donations in Bitcoin , called the ad “reckless.”\n“These comments about my supporters are sensationalist, wildly inaccurate, and in line with my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology,” Forde told me in an email. “If they were speculating they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in Bitcoin. They didn’t HODL, they donated to my campaign in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology.” Read More: Why Doesn’t the US Government HODL Seized Bitcoins?\nForde said the reason his campaign accepted Bitcoin in the first place is because Nicholas Negroponte, a co-founder of the MIT Media Lab who Forde described as “one of the world’s most brilliant technical visionaries,” would only donate to the campaign if it accepted cryptocurrency.\nForde said misunderstandings about new technology is part of the reason why he’s running for office. He’s part of a growing contingent of scientists and technologists running for office to combat a significant anti-science sentiment in Washington under the Trump administration.\n“While his ad disparages a technology he clearly doesn’t understand, the United Nations uses it to address human trafficking,” Forde said, citing a UN-led project in Moldova to use blockchain-based IDs to stop sex-trafficking. “We need more rational scientists and technologists in congress armed with evidence-based policymaking, not politicians making irrational decisions based on their emotions.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-fec-political-action-committees-bitcoins-20140508-story.html", "https://secure.forde.com/fundraisers/250-000-reasons-crypto-is-money/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moldova-blockchain-child-trafficking/moldova-eyes-blockchain-to-end-child-trafficking-idUSKBN1DF2GQ"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian forde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave min", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "attacks congressional candidate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital currency initiative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T16:34:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3359e9864b98dabf80d2fe538396ec8a7ce09d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBfb_j7fCeiZn1UMTcDVgdy4GHwHl7hqmtED.vCzphfFUbJHPdmQm8jzLUBIlEDNDAoIu7_w.nBA--", "site_full": "mrtopstep.com", "site": "mrtopstep.com", "site_section": "http://mrtopstep.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "MrTopStep.com", "title": "Bitcoin Is Trying To Stage A Comeback", "title_full": "Bitcoin Is Trying To Stage A Comeback", "published": "2018-05-22T15:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3359e9864b98dabf80d2fe538396ec8a7ce09d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBfb_j7fCeiZn1UMTcDVgdy4GHwHl7hqmtED.vCzphfFUbJHPdmQm8jzLUBIlEDNDAoIu7_w.nBA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nadex.com", "published": "2018-05-22T15:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Is Trying To Stage A Comeback", "text": "Nadex.com Commentary In December 2017 Bitcoin traded to a high of $19,343.04 which was an incredible feat considering it was at six cents in 2010.

May 22, 2018\nProfitcoins.io is being hyped as one of the most promising fintech and cryptocurrency startups in 2018 – a no-brainer way to profit using the arbitrage principle. Profitcoins.io utilizes arbitrage – the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a price difference – as a way to make profits by exploiting the volatility of the currency in today’s cryptocurrency market. You can trade cryptocurrencies on over 170+ different exchanges throughout the world and there is plenty of opportunity to profit. Arbitrage in the Foreign Exchange Market is a risk-free trading strategy, resulting in profits without open currency exposure. Of course, this requires a great deal of studying, knowledge, patience, knowing when to act, and acting fast when the time is right. Providers are regularly trading digital currency; and, depending on the day (or even time of day), there could be extreme price fluctuations from when the coin was purchased and sold. For example, in November of 2017, Bitcoin hit $10,000 on a South Korean exchange, but was trading at $9,748 on US exchange at the same time. Savvy investors made a quick and easy $252 in the matter of seconds on this price difference. The internet is riddled with tools , advice, spreadsheets, books, eBooks, and guides on how to arbitrage cryptocurrencies. Of course, you need to be knowledgeable in Forex, as well as familiar with terminology, such as bids, asks, order book, spreads, etc. Profiting as an arbitrageur is definitely a full-time job! Even with the amount of work you put into being a cryptocurrency arbitrageur, there are always downfalls. For example, it’s almost impossible to get the timing right with these exchanges and could actually result in you losing money. Plus, many exchanges employ an API call rate limit, severely limiting your actions. For example, if you don’t constantly keep an eye on how often you send a request, you might run into the limit when it seriously counts, such as canceling an order. Further, trade commission fees, as well as fees for withdrawals, deposits, processing, and rebalancing accounts can eat up any profits you actually make. But, wouldn’t it be nice if we had a tool that could not only spot these price differences, but do the trading for you so you can just sit back and watch your investment grow? Introducing Profitcoins.io! Profitcoins.io utilizes an arbitrage algorithm to analyse all cryptocurrency exchanges and to find each price fluctuation. The same algorithm is connected to the platform via API to make super-fast transitions as soon as it finds a price fluctuation. Plus, they employ PCCTA (Predictive Crypto Currency Trading Algorithm) to save, analyse, and compare all data collected. Through this algorithm, they are able to determine which pairs and platforms tend to have the highest and longest lasting price fluctuations. Finally, there is a fool-proof way to profit in the cryptocurrency market through the use of arbitrage without any of the work!

In the spirit of openess & freedom, Gavin & Mike naively made the mistake of letting too many bad actors (like Blockstream) gain access to the Bitcoin BTC project.\nThe Blockstream side had more money, and they had Theymos (who controls the #1 & #2 Bitcoin communities - rBitcoin & BitcoinTalk.org). As a result, they were able to push enough of the community into believing that small blocks were the way to go.\nAs Gavin & Mike were being pushed out, they tried to create the first \"big block\" fork of Bitcoin, called Bitcoin XT. The Blockstream / Bitcoin Core side hired a botnet operator to DDoS Bitcoin XT to death in its infancy.\nAfter Blockstream successfully took over Bitcoin Core and expelled anyone who opposed them, Gavin and I forked Bitcoin Core to create Bitcoin XT, the first alternative node implementation to gain any serious usage. The creation of XT led to the imposition of censorship across all Bitcoin discussion forums and news outlets, resulted in the creation of this sub, and Core supporters paid a botnet operator to force XT nodes offline with DDoS attacks.\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/\nGavin & Mike were pushed out.\nEven Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, was censored by rBitcoin back in 2015:\n\"I just unsubscribed rBitcoin and subscribed /r/btc \" - Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase (largest fiat gateway for crypto), Nov 2015\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7x5rgp/flashback_i_just_unsubscribed_rbitcoin_and/\nhttps://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/662817238676668416\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/\nVitalik Buterin talks about the absurd censorship on rBitcoin:\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=uL9VoxCFqT0 By 2016, the Bilderberg Group & AXA funded Blockstream, and the takeover was complete.\nMy List of Links & Sources: https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@normalrc/how-the-bilderberg-group-took-over-bitcoin-btc-links-and-proof-inside Any talk about \"big blocks\" and \"low fees\" was banned.\nCensored Post: https://i.imgur.com/J4d7cc5.png In August 2017, the second another attempt to create a \"big block\" fork happened, thus creating Bitcoin Cash (BCH). And learning from the defeat of Bitcoin XT, this time around, Bitcoin Cash made sure they had the support of big miners, so the Blockstream / Bitcoin Core side couldn't use a botnet to DDoS it to death in the cradle.\nSo that is where we are today.\nBitcoin BTC has been taken over by the Bilderberg Group / Blockstream, deliberately crippled by small blocks & high fees , so people will have to use the Lightning Network (which is where Bilderberg Group / Blockstream will profit). This was pushed through via brutal censorship on the #1 & #2 Bitcoin communities (rBitcoin & BitcoinTalk.org, which are both controlled by Theymos)\nBitcoin Cash BCH continues with bigger block size limits, low fees, and the P2P electronic cash system vision as laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8l6gmf/rbitcoin_mods_removed_top_post_the_rich_dont_need/dzdjy4i/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/662817238676668416", "https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@normalrc/how-the-bilderberg-group-took-over-bitcoin-btc-links-and-proof-inside", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL9VoxCFqT0"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T11:30:27.066+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c243ffb83c3cf0d8183088d8231e87e197b96371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaQdK0GYa6bKxByYTIH7Vvw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "title_full": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-05-22T15:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c243ffb83c3cf0d8183088d8231e87e197b96371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaQdK0GYa6bKxByYTIH7Vvw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ed_Berrington", "published": "2018-05-22T15:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "text": "I think that the most optimal option is how to earn bitcoins in 2018 is cloud-based mining.

Yet here we are in a place where cryptocurrency is no longer just something techies talk about in their inner circles. Instead, it is proving to be a real force. Royalty Free Photo\nWith that said, just like anything, cryptocurrency, in particular, Bitcoin, has been evolving, and it looks like the days of robots and AI are not only fast-approaching – they are already here. So, what’s to stop AI from tearing down the world like so many big movies show? Well, that’s where organizations are taking charge and making sure the blockchain technology is used to our benefit at all times. The Innovative Magnus Collective is Drawing the Attention of Investors\nWhen it comes to organizations that are not only embracing AI but that are also harnessing its powers, look no further than the innovative Magnus Collective ICO campaign. The Magnus Collective is working to change the way automation, robotics, and AI is used in every industry.\nThe Magnus Collective recognizes that the use of robotics and automation is picking up in industries thanks to the fact that prices are coming down. Performance of these technologies is improving and become more exact, and it is becoming common practice to use robotics of some sort in various companies. It’s as though companies have finally come to accept blockchain technology and are now embracing it fully, thanks to the fact it actually empowers AI and innovation in general.\nEven the idea of decentralized, or blockchain technology, seemed far-fetched not that long ago, but it is what is used to manage the Bitcoin database and transactions. When Tokens, Robotics, and AI Collide\nWhat happens when tokens, robotics, and AI collide? Well, that’s exactly the thought process behind The Magnus Collective is since it is the first in the world to offer dual token robotics and AI that has been built on two different platforms. These platforms are NEO and Ethereum. The idea is that people can actually purchase “smarter”, and to top it off, The Magnus Collective has industry leading ICO ratings with a low-risk score.\nBuying smarter refers to much more than what you may see on the surface. As The Magnus Collective explains, it’s as though every artificial intelligent machine and robot is able to communicate with one another offering the most streamlined growth possible. The way in which this can help investors, industries, and businesses is just starting to be understood since it is so vast. What Does the Future Hold?\nThere are many out there who believe that in the not too distant future, AI will soon be at human levels, and beyond that, the level of intelligence is limitless. The Magnus Collective is looking at their program as a way to help propel humans forward and use AI to their benefit and advantage, rather than seeing it in a negative light.\nAbout the Author: Boris Dzhingarov graduated UNWE with major marketing.

St. Juliens, Malta. The cryptocurrency world has seen a rollercoaster ride in the past year. This included Crypto Exchange crashes, Bitcoin rises and slumps, wallet hacks and what not. Though the market cap as a whole has been increasing over the years, Bitcoin’s exclusive dominance to the % of Market cap is getting reduced by the new revolutionary cryptocurrencies.\nAbout 303 token sales have taken place this year already, which surpasses the 210 token sale count of 2017. Only 48% of these have been successful. All this has obviously made it crucial for the market to have a more stable backdrop. This market opportunity was seen and has been successfully met with a revolutionary new cryptocurrency known as Ligercoin.\nWhat is Ligercoin\nLigercoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the Ethereum blockchain and is powered by Smart Contracts. It helps users to gamble safely in both offline and online Casino and Fantasy League platforms, and Live Betting Websites.\nThe Current Market Scenario\nLigercoin aims to disrupt the market of Offline and Online Casinos, Fantasy Sports Portals, and Live Betting Websites. This places Ligercoin in a big industry that is continuously growing.\nThe Offline Casino market is evaluated at approximately $240 Billion with about 7000+ Casinos around the world. This is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8%. On the other hand, the Online Casino marketplace is considered to reach a potential of $100 Billion in the coming 5 years with a CAGR of about 13.5%.\nSimilarly, the Fantasy Sports market is another emerging sector. Though it is a relatively small market currently, it is growing at a remarkable rate of 25% CAGR. 51% of the players have an average annual income of $75,000 and the average spend of the players being $556.\nThis proves that Ligercoin is tapping the right industry at the right time. Liger finds itself at the heart of a promising future with an aim to achieve a 1% market share by 2022 that amounts to a whopping $4 Billion. This increases the use cases of the currency which in-turn increases the demand, driving the price up.\nFighting Volatility through Staking\nThe market prices of cryptocurrencies are always subject to extreme volatility. The Volatility Index that takes into account the market of 6 leading cryptocurrencies(BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, XMR) substantiates this theory.\nLigercoin tames this beast with its unique staking mechanism. Liger allows token holders to stake their tokens to the Casino. This makes them virtually be on the Casino’s side on the bets. The win of the Casino is then distributed to all the stakers in the ratio of their contribution. This unique system also ‘burns’ a small part of the earnings. This reduces the supply and increases the demand to help the price move up.\nThere are two aspects that can drive the demand up or down – adoption of the coin and the number of coins in circulation. The demand will increase as Ligercoin penetrates the market, while the Burning Mechanism will ensure that the number of coins decrease. Couple this with the realization that the staked coins also go out of circulation and the price rise becomes exponential.\nLiger’s Bright Future\nThe future of Ligercoin looks really promising. The Liger Wallet makes it possible to place bets at an offline Casino table in Vegas while being in bed at home.\nMoreover, Ligercoin has the potential to eventually be the most stable cryptocurrency. The coin will be largely adopted since no geographical restrictions exist. Also, seamless synchronization of offline and online Casino environments is a remarkable innovation on its own.\nLiger’s core Team with a rich domain expertise across the Casino, Media & Sports and Financial Services Industries and their Technical expertise with BI and BA exposure in some of the biggest companies will be ideal to execute the processes on the ground.\nHence, to sum it up, higher technological adoption coupled with a booming market paves way for an optimistic future for Ligercoin and makes it one of leading cryptocurrencies today.\nVisit the Website – https://www.ligercoin.com/ Meet the Team – https://www.ligercoin.com/#team Chat on Telegram – https://t.me/TheLigerCoin\nName: Ali Haider Email: info@ligercoin.com\nLigercoin is the source of this content.

You will be told that you can’t buy a cup of coffee with it and that it has no \"use case\" as money. Even some \"believers\" say it is not currency but is instead digital gold for staking up while it appreciates to some incredible lofty value.\nThis might be the case but Bitcoin is definitely money.\nIt is valuable money as it is incredibly useful.\nAllow me to demonstrate.\nI want to sell a product, let’s say I’m a business making some normal margin product, such as picture frames. A customer comes to me from Africa and he is desperate to get a container load of frames costing $20,000.\nI will of course say, “Pay me up front” and my new African customer says, “Sure.”\nI am now ten days away from getting the money. They might take a day or two to get their paperwork straight, perhaps as much as a month. The paperwork we have to go through at our end is a nightmare and it may or may not show up as expected and it may or may not cost a couple of percent in forex charges and various other charges. Heaven forbid it’s a big order and we need a letter of credit.\nAll sorts of things can go wrong. The letter of credit can be fake. The order can be produced awaiting the payment only to find the order has gone away. The money can bounce around because one bank in the chain messed up.\nThe whole process is fraught.\nSo they offer to pay the lot on credit card.\nWe might not be able to take that payment and the charge from the company, even if we take credit cards, may be 3%-5% of the invoice. Then six months later the untested customer can call their credit card company and say they never bought the goods and we get a huge chargeback and have lost not only the profit but the principle too.\nSo instead we say, “We take Bitcoin” and they say, “Fine.”\nThen a few minutes later we have notification the payment has been sent. There is no going back for that money. A few minutes later we have the full amount confirmed and if we have our cryptocurrency ‘ducks in a row’ the fiat is on the way in another few minutes.\nThat is an electrifying improvement in business process and it is real, today, right now.\n“But,” the no-coiners say, “Bitcoin has a high cost, not the few cents it was meant to have.” That can be true, but for this B2B order $50 is not an issue. The worst lag of say, one day to get the cash at the worst performance last year when Bitcoin was going mad, is nothing to the wait in conventional banking, and now the pandemonium over transaction times are back down to minutes and costs to a few cents again.\nYet even then the fact that you can see the money on its way for sure is a huge benefit over the \"pay and pray\" system of international interbank transfers.\nFor B2B transactions and international ones, Bitcoin is a tremendous tool. As a businessman I would prefer to be paid in Bitcoin now than paid in slow, expensive to process fiat that might arrive at some indeterminate point in the future.\nThis is an extremely valuable \"use case\" for Bitcoin and it is the crypto coin’s liquidity not price that is the value.\nI do not care if Bitcoin is $100 or $1 million a coin. So long as I can get it and convert it in a few hours, it’s absolute value is of no importance to me. You might think the price volatility is an issue, but moves can go either way so they cancel out over time and my holding period is short, so I have no material exposure to this volatility on average.\nSo forget the revolutionary hype, which is real, and instead focus on the value add.\nThis single Bitcoin use case is a huge benefit to a business that wants to be agile. It telescopes order processing, it brings cash payments forward, it lowers risk and it decreases work.\nThis single example of valuable functionality that pioneering companies are exploiting today is why the cryptocurrency revolution is real and why it is no magic money, smoke-and-mirrors craze.\nSo rest assured when you hear people say that Bitcoin is a scam with no purpose to exist, they are very wrong.\nBitcoin is a fantastic B2B tool for companies looking to be as agile as possible.\nClem Chambers is the CEO of private investors Web site ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich , The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Finvestor%2F2018%2F05%2F22%2Fbitcoin-is-for-agile-companies%2F&text=Bitcoin%20telescopes%20order%20processing%2C%20brings%20cash%20payments%20forward%2C%20lowers%20risk%20and%20decreases%20work.", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00R3ABO9G", "http://www.advfn.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00HCOUWS2", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B079MJHCX2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T15:50:26.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f67f9906ea0d76eb13d64bf400f80dc3ae47198d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rkAmrOhVn_NzWHbgZsWdfo", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "He Paid How Much?

On Monday, the widely followed cryptocurrency investor said that Bitcoin cash is the must-own digital currency of the moment, according to CNBC . Developments around Bitcoin Cash\nThe primary reason for his recommendation is the proposal of a “Bitcoin Cash Development Fund,” which will offer numerous opportunities to fund the development of necessary applications and other artifacts on top of the bitcoin cash blockchain . Over the weekend, Bitcoin Cash miners had a meeting to discuss the necessary funding for the proposal. As per their proposal, the miners will contribute some part of their mining rewards to the bitcoin cash development fund, and that capital will be used to carry on the necessary development of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\n\"That's how blockchains gain value,\" he added. \"You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash,\" Kelly said.\nLast week, Kelly launched his actively managed blockchain exchange traded fund (ETF) called the REX BKCM ETF ( BKC ). It will invest in the stocks of about 33 blockchain- and cryptocurrency -related companies. Bitcoin Cash Gains Popularity\nBitcoin cash has been gaining ground in recent times. It surged from the levels of around $634 in early April to the peak of around $1,818 by early May making it the best performing cryptocurrency during the period. It also got a recommendation from Roger Ver, aka \"Bitcoin Jesus,\" who stated his preference for Bitcoin cash as the global cryptocurrency, for its ease of use. (For more, see 'Bitcoin Jesus' is Bullish on Bitcoin Cash .)\nBitcoin cash emerged last year as a hard fork of the original bitcoin cryptocurrency, and is now the fourth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization . Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency with the highest market cap but continues to suffer from transaction processing delays, making its wider adoption problematic. Bitcoin Cash offers great utility in terms of being used as a medium of daily transaction with hassle-free instant processing, which is leading to it increasing adoption. Additionally, the continuous development of infrastructure and new innovations being built on Bitcoin Cash will contribute to its growing popularity. (See also, Bitcoin Cash: The New King of Cryptocurrency? )\nBitcoin Cash was trading at $1,188.41 Tuesday morning, down about 5 percent over the past 24-hour period.

It seemed like a rather innocuous trade, but it’s commemorated by cryptocurrency fans as the first time someone traded bitcoins for a real-world commodity. “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz, then 32 years old, told the New York Times in December 2013. “No one knew it was going to get so big.” Big is an understatement. While Hanyecz traded his bitcoins for a relatively fair price at the time, that same amount is now worth a staggering $82 million. The trade, which took place the year after Bitcoin itself launched, is now commemorated with traditions like Twitter’s Bitcoin Pizza Tracker , which follows the astronomical rise of Hanyecz’s pies: Article continues below The revolution will not be televised.

On Tuesday, it showed the same amount of Bitcoin could buy a staggering 6,584,128 pizzas. If those boxes were stacked, it would stretch over 180 miles into the sky, edging toward the Kármán line that marks outer space. Hanyecz made the request on the BitcoinTalk forums on May 18, 2010. Under the username “ laszlo ,” he gave very little details about his order, except that he’d be willing to pay 10,000 bitcoins for “a couple of pizzas,” with the dream of “getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!” As for toppings, he asked for “just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.” While Hanyecz had used his computer to mine some bitcoins, he hadn’t really used them for anything. Each coin was worth around 0.003 cents each. However, forum users noted that even in the nascent days of Bitcoin, he could have sold the 10,000 for $41 on BitcoinMarket. That wasn’t enough to deter Hanyecz, who shared images of his completed purchase: The first food purchased with Bitcoin. Eight years later, Bitcoin is accepted slightly further afield than peer-to-peer deals for Papa John’s. A number of major online stores including Microsoft support Bitcoin payments, and it powers a number of exchanges including Coinbase and Abra that offer rapid transfer between fiat currencies. The community hasn’t forgotten Hanyecz’s heroic quest. Ledger has released a limited edition red “Pizza Day” cryptocurrency hardware wallet to mark the occasion, while BTC.com is offering free pizza to the first 10 people to share a photo of their meal. It may look like any ordinary pizzas, but it was enough to fuel a global movement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/", "https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s-pizza-day", "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/", "https://www.forextime.com/uk/education/infographic/bitcoin-growth", "https://twitter.com/btccom_official/status/998863106964119552", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195", "https://twitter.com/bitcoin_pizza/status/998386420560662528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/bitcoin_pizza", "http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/pizza/.t/IMG_0984.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter’s bitcoin pizza tracker", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:33:00.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "515e81aa18a0f2339a4ab7455ecb60060d5f117d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8akEWaqVNQDwzAXMmCSbDxzH8CGsGBtoPIEo5D9ObF0C2xiLDWAFQpi6THvQYeVt_jhe6J2PuOiN6r.Ls.gXXGLpqTi7lyBmAzQhzSDTe0q7fnfcGQ2EEX6k5xOZqQX182ya5o8cCSv3BUb_UoYqnVtjBoqFjqfag2ngawO3hUQ--", "site_full": "sallbuzz.com", "site": "sallbuzz.com", "site_section": "https://sallbuzz.com/feed", "site_categories": ["shopping", "web_design_html", "couponing", "tech"], "section_title": "SAllBuzz", "title": "8 years ago a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoin for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto", "title_full": "8 years ago a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoin for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto", "published": "2018-05-22T15:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b04069b1ae6622f008b49f5-640-320.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "515e81aa18a0f2339a4ab7455ecb60060d5f117d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8akEWaqVNQDwzAXMmCSbDxzH8CGsGBtoPIEo5D9ObF0C2xiLDWAFQpi6THvQYeVt_jhe6J2PuOiN6r.Ls.gXXGLpqTi7lyBmAzQhzSDTe0q7fnfcGQ2EEX6k5xOZqQX182ya5o8cCSv3BUb_UoYqnVtjBoqFjqfag2ngawO3hUQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Source All Buzz", "published": "2018-05-22T15:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "8 years ago a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoin for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto", "text": "in Business 8 years ago a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoin for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto May 22, 2018, 12:36 pm 0\nJohn Schnatter, founder and CEO of Papa John’s Pizza, arrives at the 2011 American Music Awards in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters\nHappy Bitcoin Pizza Day!\nFor bitcoin newbies, crypto-enthusiasts around the world celebrate May 22, the anniversary of one of the earliest bitcoin purchases: two Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin.\nLaszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, purchased the two pizzas from a fellow bitcoiner in Jacksonville Florida, according to the New York Times. In 2013, Hanyecz didn’t sound too broken up about the deal in an interview with the Times.\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,”Hanyecz said.\nStill, those coins would be worth $82 million at bitcoin’s last price of $8,200 a coin, according to Markets Insider data. There’s a Twitter account that provides a daily update on how much the pizzas would have cost based on the current price of bitcoin.\nTwitter/@bitcoin_pizza\nBitcoin gained worldwide attention at the end of 2017 as it soared close to $20,000 and infiltrated trading and investment firms across Wall Street. But the coin’s origins trace back to 2008 and an anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who’s vision was to create a rival financial system based on a technology called blockchain.\nStill, many merchants are afraid to accept bitcoin because of its spine-tingling volatility. In 2017, Morgan Stanley described the lack of places to buy goods with bitcoin as striking.\n“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking,” analysts wrote.\nThat hasn’t kept Wall Street away. A number of top trading firms are active in crypto markets, including DRW and Virtu Financial. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin trading operation. And Morgan Stanley was looking to beef up its equity-research unit with crypto experts.

There is NO LINK. Please do not report it, Tards. Kind Regards, LJS . \"Man I was early… Earlier than I remembered…I thought I started buying Bitcoin in 2014, but as I sat down to write this email today, I decided to do a quick search through my email archive to see if I could find any records to verify that timeline…Well I did… And it turns out that my date was wrong.Here’s my first deposit receipt from Mt.Gox, verifying that I’d wired $30,000 to my account, on March 26th, 2013... The price was $77 that day, which would have purchased 390 Bitcoin.Today, that would be worth around $3.2MM. Back in December at its peak price of $20,000, it would be worth $7.8 million.But it’s all gone.It was stolen when Mt.Gox was hacked less than a year later.I wanted to share this story with you because it’s a real example of the risks that are out there right now in the crypto world.In fact, this industry has more sharks in the water than ever before.Why?Because the money involved is bigger than ever before.There are a lot of bad guys around the world who would love to steal your crypto.In total, more than 980,000 Bitcoin have been stolen over the past few years, which is worth around $8.3 billion today.If your account gets hacked?Well too bad. There are no guarantees or regulations in place yet to insure your assets against loss like you’d find in the banking world.The good news, is that security on the major exchanges has improved greatly since the early days, but it’s far from perfect.Ultimately, the protection of your crypto-assets is your responsibility, and the safety of your assets is only as good the weakest link in your security process.Unfortunately, thefts continue to happen on a daily basis…If you have already invested in crypto-assets, or if you plan to start investing soon, there is a very good chance that your portfolio could be worth millions… Even tens-of-millions of dollars within the next 2-3 years.Life changing money…Assuming Bitcoin hits $100,000 as many of us predict that it will, my 390 Bitcoin would be worth $39,000,000.So what you can do to protect your portfolio?Well there are different levels of security that you can take and processes you can implement, but I’m going to keep things simple for now…What you need to know is that your Bitcoin is represented by a private key… A long string of letters and numbers that is essentially the password that gives someone control of that Bitcoin.Whoever has this private key, has control over that Bitcoin.So how can you protect it?One of the easiest steps you can take, is to store your Bitcoin (your private keys), OFFLINE.If you keep your Bitcoin ONLINE on an exchange, or in a software wallet on your computer or phone, those devices are susceptible to being hacked. If there’s an internet connection, they’re at risk.So a simple way to get your crypto offline, is to use a hardware wallet.This is a small hardware device the size of a key chain, that allows you to store your crypto offline, which makes it infinitely more difficult to access.The two most popular hardware wallets are from Trezor.io and LedgerWallet.comBoth are very effective at what they do.But what happens if you lose that device? Or if it gets stolen?Well that’s when things start to get a bit more complicated. All wallets… Software and hardware, come with a “recovery seed”. This is a series of 12-24 words that you can use to recover your crypto.If you lose your wallet, all you need to do is download or buy a new one, enter your recovery seed, and it will restore control of your entire portfolio.So how do you protect that recovery seed?Write it down on a piece of paper? What happens if your house catches on fire? Or if it gets lost?You see, securing your assets is a bit of a rabbit hole, and it can get pretty complicated once you have a portfolio of dozens of different assets, many of which will require unique wallets.If you’d like to learn my personal security process, I’ll share that with you later this week.In the meantime, stay tuned for Part 5 which will answer one of the biggest questions of all…Which should you buy for the largest potential gains? Bitcoin, or Alt-coins…We’ll take a look back at how both categories performed in 2017, and the numbers will shock you…Stay tuned.\" Last Edited by Dr. Lady Jane Smith on 05/21/2018 09:43 PM WARNING: Red Pills may induce cognitive dissonance among Liberals and Snowflakes Anonymous Coward", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T11:13:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc7356dbc5beb11766c0600c39e3d84b0cd2251d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRy42s9yrbws72kf4Pad8YgMgcXZPb3fb6Jwqa6yNwl.663wpTR9Waof6VHihAjeI5Qqcfr9iTdBYnbMJDvMbPHnNl5yMY.SdwxVbuuoTQvnbEn.ExS9EumLRLrr1rygoxJmFv4osv1xTvXSiK37YRJlPgasebn_oE-", "site_full": "paymentsafrika.com", "site": "paymentsafrika.com", "site_section": "http://paymentsafrika.com/feed", "site_categories": ["travel", "africa"], "section_title": "Payments Afrika", "title": "Centbee and nChain Partner to Create Toolkit to Accept Bitcoin Cash at Point of Sale", "title_full": "Centbee and nChain Partner to Create Toolkit to Accept Bitcoin Cash at Point of Sale", "published": "2018-05-22T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://paymentsafrika.com/live/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Agreement.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc7356dbc5beb11766c0600c39e3d84b0cd2251d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRy42s9yrbws72kf4Pad8YgMgcXZPb3fb6Jwqa6yNwl.663wpTR9Waof6VHihAjeI5Qqcfr9iTdBYnbMJDvMbPHnNl5yMY.SdwxVbuuoTQvnbEn.ExS9EumLRLrr1rygoxJmFv4osv1xTvXSiK37YRJlPgasebn_oE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff Reporter", "published": "2018-05-22T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Centbee and nChain Partner to Create Toolkit to Accept Bitcoin Cash at Point of Sale", "text": "South Africa 570\nnChain and Centbee announced a partnership which will ensure the speedy development of a merchant point of sale (PoS) software development kit (SDK) for the worldwide market. This SDK is an open-source set of tools, processes and interfaces that software developers and system integrators can use to enable retailers to easily and quickly accept Bitcoin Cash at the till-point. The announcement was made at the first CoinGeek conference, focused on merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash and growth of a new bCommerce (Bitcoin commerce) world.\nAngus Brown, Centbee co-CEO explains, “Merchant acceptance of Bitcoin has been very limited to date. Centbee announced earlier this year that we would roll out mechanisms for merchants to accept Bitcoin Cash payments without exposure to price volatility and without installing new terminal hardware. This SDK is that global payment system.”\nThe project is funded by nChain to promote its vision of making it easy for everyone to use Bitcoin Cash for payments. Bitcoin Cash fulfils the original vision for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system specifically built for worldwide transactions.\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen remarks: “As Centbee has focused on user-friendly Bitcoin wallets and merchant payment solutions we have partnered with them to ensure retailers can accept Bitcoin Cash at in-store points of sale for goods and services. This SDK will make it easier for merchants, through their PoS systems, to join the world of bCommerce. Centbee smartly embraces Bitcoin Cash because of its bigger blocks, low fees and fast transaction network represent the true vision of Bitcoin.”\nLast year, Centbee successfully piloted the acceptance of Bitcoin payments at retail points of sale.\nIn January 2018, nChain’s investment arm, nChain Reaction, made an equity investment in Centbee.\nBased in South Africa, Centbee was founded in 2016 by co-CEOs, Lorien Gamaroff and Angus Brown.

They know Bitcoin futures could be manipulated and they needed coins to do that. So they started to buy coins before the price increased to a ATH.\nI have always believed that if there weren't any future markets going live, we wouldn't be anywhere near the all time high levels of last year. It's impossible to exactly point out what the main reason behind it was, because it could be traders anticipating on institutions entering the Bitcoin space, which is reason enough to cause a massive bull run, or it was indeed an institutional lead high to massively short Bitcoin afterwards. For that reason I am curious to find out what the long-short ratio was at the time of opening.\nIs there anyone with log information covering that subject and within that specific time frame? I have tried looking it up but couldn't find anything useful.\nIn the end these futures might as well be a gimmick for the time being, but the external uses are quite beneficial. Miners for example could just set up a contract with buyers that at whatever point in time the buyer will buy X number of Bitcoins at Y price, which ensures the miner to have a steady income even when the market absolutely tanks. In the non crypto world regular farmers use futures to sell their products at the rates that are worthwhile for them, and I don't see why miners won't be doing this as well.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T09:03:41.067+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c47798e73a178c4b5b09285d6d2d00e44776325f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRMLQxqGP8Jjwd750EVworgnD0RgCSoO9IiyufaoCuzw6aSnvlZXA_2fJBDEXGdihV2mm7qsd7SoFsh.GOxRwvgKfuMc7q3cKIkFvl.u2hbgA--", "site_full": "thedayaftergr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thedayaftergr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Thedayaftergr", "title": "R: As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO", "title_full": "R: As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO", "published": "2018-05-22T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c47798e73a178c4b5b09285d6d2d00e44776325f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRMLQxqGP8Jjwd750EVworgnD0RgCSoO9IiyufaoCuzw6aSnvlZXA_2fJBDEXGdihV2mm7qsd7SoFsh.GOxRwvgKfuMc7q3cKIkFvl.u2hbgA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TheDayAfterGr Letta Kalamara (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "R: As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T15:30:28.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "317fbbf46308d62e23f815d20060d9b2f9a6a0a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zd2Ojf1vSLGTIsEsNgKTPwIrGsgZAy7bBw2Mlmtjt3IwKbkL8APNecY06sXhJ7p2wMyrjGuGPL4SuapfQaObOcI-", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Vanguard Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Implosion to Zero", "title_full": "Vanguard Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Implosion to Zero", "published": "2018-05-22T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Vanguard-Economist-300x300.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "317fbbf46308d62e23f815d20060d9b2f9a6a0a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zd2Ojf1vSLGTIsEsNgKTPwIrGsgZAy7bBw2Mlmtjt3IwKbkL8APNecY06sXhJ7p2wMyrjGuGPL4SuapfQaObOcI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-22T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vanguard Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Implosion to Zero", "text": "Vanguard Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Implosion to Zero May 22, 2018 15 Views\nVanguard’s Global Chief Economist and Global Head of Vanguard Investment Strategy, Joe Davis believes the price of bitcoin is headed to Zero.

After dropping below the $10,000 mark, the cryptocurrency has struggled to bounce back arousing concerns as to what the future holds.\nSo where is bitcoin headed? That’s the big question, which continues to baffle the industry amidst mixed sentiments.

The sentiment comes as a surprise given that many high profile investors that had similar views over the past year have had a change of heart.\nHowever, Mr. Davis is backing his thesis with many factors that he believes will play a pivotal role in the price of the popular cryptocurrency tanking to zero . Cryptocurrencies vs. Currencies\nThere has been a lot of discussion as to why cryptocurrencies are currencies of the future. How true that is, is still a point of debate. There is no doubt that just like traditional currencies, virtual currencies do qualify as units of account as they can be used to measure the value of goods and services.\nCryptocurrencies also qualify as a medium of exchange. However, there’ are a limited number of vendors that accept them as a means of settling transactions. Increased levels of volatility had all but stifled their adoption, something that Mr. Davis believes will continue to haunt bitcoin prospects and sentiments going forward.\nFiat currencies act as a store of value something that cannot be said about bitcoin despite being the largest cryptocurrency. Price volatility is expected to continue undermining its adoption a headwind that the Vanguard executive believes will continue to hurt its price going forward. Regulations Headache\nRegulation poses the biggest threat to cryptocurrencies, even though most of them do qualify for niche purposes. According to Mr. Davis, Central banks pose the biggest threat to bitcoin prospects. Given that most of them have already started to research on blockchain-based currencies raises serious concerns.\nStringent regulations on exchanges have already started to crop up, something that Mr. Davis believes does not provide a suitable environment for the success of virtual currencies. The fact that some central banks are contemplating creating and adopting their digital currencies all but spell trouble for bitcoin, which was developed with the aim of replacing fiat currencies and reduce the influence of governments.\nThe fact that the new digital currencies would be legal tender, recognized as a form of payment for all debts and charges, could significantly affect bitcoin adoption in the mainstream sector.\nGiven a choice between blockchain-based dollar and bitcoin, most people are likely to go with the former. Bitcoin as an Investment\nContrary to perception, bitcoin is not an investment. Unlike other financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and currencies, bitcoin does not generate cash flows such as dividends or interest payments. Another deficiency of the popular cryptocurrency has to do with the fact that its price is not derived from any underlying economic activity.\nBitcoin price is not based on any economic fundamentals, and its price tends to move up and down on speculation. The value of the digital currency has mostly been undermined by the high levels of speculation that makes it be volatile thus unstable.\nBitcoin value is not tied to the blockchain. The cryptocurrency is merely an investment in blockchain whose value will always be based on speculation.\nA lack of cash flows with bitcoin investment as well as extreme volatility all but explains why Davis remains pessimistic about bitcoin as an investment and its long-term price.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://vanguardblog.com/2018/02/06/bitcoin-digital-gold-or-fools-gold/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-davis-8a434646/detail/photo/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard economist warns of bitcoin implosion to zero vanguard economist warns of bitcoin implosion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global head of vanguard investment strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linkedin bitcoin headed to zero vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:42:04.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69e76d0abb567500beffb6aae1f3f80e0a84cd9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywum.GWBkfWypA7qvPH0qoz_NNK5ILM6fZJMMaYjcFaKg-", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Crypto Revolution Starts Reshaping Global Politics", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Crypto Revolution Starts Reshaping Global Politics", "published": "2018-05-22T15:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69e76d0abb567500beffb6aae1f3f80e0a84cd9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywum.GWBkfWypA7qvPH0qoz_NNK5ILM6fZJMMaYjcFaKg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T15:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Crypto Revolution Starts Reshaping Global Politics", "text": "Before all the Lambo memes, shady no-product ICOs, and get-rich-quick schemes invaded the scene, Bitcoin was meant to disrupt the current economic system. Today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief showcases how that promise is starting to materialize in different fields, including the future of elections and geopolitics.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture\nIran and Russia Consider Bitcoin to Skirt Sanctions Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. Mohammad-Reza Pourebrahimi, who chairs the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, raised the idea during a recent meeting in Moscow with Dmitry Mezentsev, the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy. He explained that the Russians \"share our opinion. We said that if we manage to move this work forward, then we will be the first countries that use digital currencies in the exchange of goods.\"\nIran's government-owned media Press TV reports that the country's leadership \"specifically started to look at bitcoin as an alternative monetary means to be used in trade after it became clear that European companies were failing to trade with Iran over fears that they would fall afoul of US primary sanctions.\" It should be noted that the Iranian government is trying to stop its citizens from having access to global markets it seeks for itself, banning banks from dealing with crypto and even traditional foreign currency exchange shops . Still, Iranian citizens have reportedly sent more than $2.5 billion out of the country to purchase cryptocurrencies with.\nUS Politician Raises $100k From Crypto Community Congressional candidate Brian Forde has celebrated on Monday in San Francisco his campaign raising $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations. A former head of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative and Obama's Senior Technology Advisor, he is considered to be a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile his main Democratic opponent, a former SEC enforcement attorney, has attacked Forde for his work in cryptocurrency, referring to his donors in an ad as \"bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.\"\nThis contested race is shaping up to be a major example of cryptocurrency impact on electoral politics in America. It is also nice to see that the matter is now getting bipartisan support in the US. As we recently reported, on the other side of the country and the opposite side of the aisle , a Trump-supporting Republican and a bitcoin enthusiast is running to be the next New York Attorney General .\nLiberation Through Radical Decentralization Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled \" Liberation Through Radical Decentralization .\" In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work.\nThey remind us that: \"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in particular emerged directly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of the traditional financial system, with 'The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks' carved indelibly into Bitcoin's genesis block. That said, the decentralized technologies behind cryptocurrencies have potential applications far beyond finance.\"\nReal Products, Real Adoption With all the recent news about so many ICOs being outright scams or just failures, it's good to remember that there are actual projects in the cryptocurrency space that are delivering real services to real users. Two recent examples are Brave and Steemit, coincidentally two different attempts to change how online content monetisation works.\nThe Brave browser recently passed 5 million downloads for the Android operating system and now boasts over 2.3 million monthly active users and over 14,000 verified publishers. And recently the one millionth account was created on the Steem blockchain, which now sees around 60,000 unique accounts transacting each day, and over 250,000 unique daily visitors for the site.\nWhat do you think about today's news updates and what they mean for the future?

In 2013, Hanyecz didn't sound too broken up about the deal in an interview with the Times .\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\"Hanyecz said.\nStill, those coins would be worth $82 million at bitcoin's last price of $8,200 a coin, according to Markets Insider data . There's a Twitter account that provides a daily update on how much the pizzas would have cost based on the current price of bitcoin.\nTwitter/@bitcoin_pizza\nBitcoin gained worldwide attention at the end of 2017 as it soared close to $20,000 and infiltrated trading and investment firms across Wall Street. But the coin's origins trace back to 2008 and an anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who's vision was to create a rival financial system based on a technology called blockchain.\nStill, many merchants are afraid to accept bitcoin because of its spine-tingling volatility. In 2017, Morgan Stanley described the lack of places to buy goods with bitcoin as striking.\n\"The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking,\" analysts wrote .\nThat hasn't kept Wall Street away.

Davis resorted to the conventional “blockchain not bitcoin” argument, claiming that the most dominant cryptocurrency has no use case.\n“I’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero,” said Davis.\nBitcoin has many use cases. Xapo, the Swiss-based cryptocurrency wallet and vault service provider, stores more than $10 billion worth of bitcoin in its cold wallets managed offline in safe Swiss vaults. According to Bloomberg, more customers have stored bitcoin in Xapo’s vault than 5,670 banks in the US.\nThe primary use case of bitcoin, due to its fungibility, transportability, security, and decentralized nature, is an efficient store of value. It protects and stores wealth better than traditional assets and stores of value, such as gold.\nHence, the claim of Davis that bitcoin does not have a use case is evidently invalid, given that it is already being used as a store of value and has been used as a digital currency since its launch in 2009.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

The cryptocurrency eventually finished the session at $1,233.64.\nDespite the slight uptick seen in yesterday’s late trading, Bitcoin Cash experienced another decline shortly after the start of today’s session. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin Cash price was hovering around $1,175, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap. The cryptocurrency has lost over 5% of its value in the past 24 hours, which is comparable to the performance of other major digital coins, such as EOS, Cardano (ADA) and IOTA (MIOTA), over the same period.\nDespite its ongoing struggles Bitcoin Cash is the must-own digital coin of the moment, according to cryptocurrency investor Brian Kelly, founder and chief executive officer of BKCM. During an appearance on CNBC’s TV programme “Fast Money” yesterday, Kelly pointed to a recent meeting of Bitcoin Cash miners, which was focused on funding a BCH development fund. In the fund miners were \"going to take some of the rewards they get from mining and put it in a fund to build stuff on top of bitcoin cash,\" Kelly said.\n\"That's how blockchains gain value,\" he added. \"You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash.\"\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin Cash price stood at $1,176.44, as of 12:52 BST. The digital currency has lost nearly 6% of its value in the past 24 hours, Coinmarketcap data shows. The digital coin’s total market capitalisation currently stands at $20.1 billion, which makes it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency on the market.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/crypto-investor-brian-kelly-makes-the-case-for-bitcoin-cash.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:39:04.002+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 14009, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=18200", "requestsLeft": 480}
