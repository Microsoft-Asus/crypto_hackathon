The company now has more customers than the brokerage giants TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: AMTD ) and Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: SCHW ) combined, according to Blockchain. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has offered a bullish outlook for his crypto firm. The executive said that he thinks that Bitcoin will have less influence over other cryptocurrency prices in the future. Garlinghouse cited the improving knowledge of other cryptocurrencies and their underlying platforms. \"There's a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of Bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies. It's early, over time you'll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,\" he said in an interview with CNBC . According to reports, Venezuela has banned the import of cryptocurrency-mining equipment, including hardware, graphics cards, and computers.

No matter how low it's value might drop, it would still strike high and recover in time.\nIt has been its nature, due to supply and demand, media, controversies, negative views about the technology, and a lot of substantial factors.

We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it's going to start a recovery process here,\" Robert Sluymer, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" on Thursday.\nBitcoin has touched its key support level around $7,000 several times this year and recovered. Most recently, prices moved as low as $7,054 this week before bouncing higher.\n\"That's certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold,\" he said.\nMomentum also looks positive to Sluymer, indicating a decline in Bitcoin may have found a floor.\n\"That RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that's really part of that bottoming phase taking hold,\" he said.\nBitcoin's relative strength index, a measure of momentum, is currently trading around 40. A level close to 30 typically indicates oversold conditions.\n\"The next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it's very simplistic, but it's a pretty good proxy across most markets,\" said Sluymer. Its 15-day moving average of roughly $7,800 \"will be the next hurdle for it to get through.\"\nBitcoin last traded around the $7,800 level a week ago. It has not traded above it since May 23.\n\"We think the setup is very attractive here,\" added Sluymer. \"If you're short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure.

Speaking on Wednesday to CNBC’s Power Lunch, Garlinghouse declared that Bitcoin could be on the verge of experiencing an influence and price downfall in the cryptocurrency community as markets are gradually becoming aware of the different currencies and alternatives available to them.\nWhen Bitcoin was initially offered in 2008, it was a game changer. For the first time, people could initiate transactions, trade, and trust in a medium of exchange without having banks or governments behind it. And with Bitcoin being the initial, most known, and largest virtual currency by market capitalization other cryptocurrencies including XRP are highly interdependent to it even though they are independent open-sourced technologies.\nThat’s something Garlinghouse believes is going to change over time as more people become aware of the other cryptocurrencies available through media coverage.\nFirst, forward to 2018, Bitcoin , the almost a decade old currency, is not the default currency of choice in moving value. It is slowly evolving to be more of an asset than a currency; investors trade it like stocks or bonds, rather than as a medium of exchange of daily goods and services.\nIts transaction costs have reached $4.50 taking days to complete a transaction instead of a few minutes. Garlinghouse jokes,\n“How are you going to use Bitcoin to buy a cup of tea? By the time the transaction is complete, it’s going to be hours later, your tea’s gonna get cold”\nBe that as it may, Ripple, the San Francisco-based company, has developed a speedier financial payment system that enables cross-border transactions with XRP being the electronic coin financial institutions use on to transact swiftly.\nBarely a month passes without Ripple making huge inroads on Bitcoin’s influence. On Wednesday, Ripple signed a partnership deal with Kuwait’s largest bank (The Kuwait Finance House) adding the financial institution to its long list of partners such as MoneyGram and Visa that are now piloting XRP for cross-border transactions.\nAs some countries introduced new regulations and rules for using cryptocurrency early this year, Bitcoin, XRP , and other digital currencies took a beating in their market performance with the market capitalization falling by more than 50% . XRP was the worst performer shedding 70% of its value and Bitcoin losing about 50% in those few months. However, with large amounts of Ripple’s currency kept in their reserves, price fluctuations are kept to a minimum with the company controlling the currency’s value.\nLast month, South Korea introduced a raft of requirements including banning all anonymous trading Bitcoin allows on its platform in a bid to neutralize all possible criminal activities. Also, the Indian government refused to acknowledge cryptocurrency as a legal tender saying they were going to put measures in place that are going to phase out payments using the virtual money.\nRipple does not operate with the same level of anonymity that bitcoin does, making the virtual coin more favorable to investors and banks. With over 100 financial institutions around the world using the blockchain, Ripple ’s dominance seems to be on the rise challenging Bitcoin’s influence.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The original edition of the draft introduces the same caps for crypto donations as for fiat ones, while limiting anonymous contributions to $20. The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue. image courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nAlthough a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.\nThe FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘ liquid democracy ,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance . The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’ – a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.\nEffectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.\nGiven somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue , so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.\nIn October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.\nWisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature . The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.\nEmmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.\nIn South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency . Heroes of Crypto-Funded Campaigns\nInstitutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.\nHowever, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding. Andrew Hemingway\nA Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary. Jared Polis\nU.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations . In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin. Dan Elder\nThe libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin . The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again. Rand Paul\nA feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir . Greg Abbott\nIn an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state. Austin Petersen\nA Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘ no-brainer .’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:\n“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.” Patrick Nelson\nDemocratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘ 21st century campaign ,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York. Brian Forde\nForde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support .\n* * *\nEven though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability.

To: Required Needs to be a valid email From: Required Needs to be a valid email Subject: This Bitcoin Price Prediction Chart Shows a Clear Path to $36,000 by 2020 Message: By David Zeiler , Associate Editor , Money Morning • @DavidGZeiler • May 31, 2018 two + = nine\nWith the price of Bitcoin down 63% from its December highs, signs the cryptocurrency will regain those highs have been few and far between.\nBut a new Bitcoin price prediction chart from Wall Street research firm Fundstrat suggests BTC will get back to those highs and beyond, reaching $36,000 by the end of 2019.\nFundstrat isn't shy about creating its own Bitcoin market indicators and has a reputation for bullish Bitcoin predictions.\nBack in January, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee set a Bitcoin price target of $25,000 for 2018 and a long-term target of $125,000 by 2022.\nThe latest from Fundstrat is a chart based on the breakeven price for the Bitcoin miners. It's the point where the miners can make a profit after covering for their expenses, like mining rigs and electricity costs.\nBy plotting the chart all the way back to 2013, Fundstrat discovered a pattern that suggests a fivefold increase in the price of Bitcoin over the next 19 months may be too conservative… The High End of This Bitcoin Price Prediction Is $64,000\nThis chart is based on the idea that multiples of the breakeven price for the Bitcoin miners create an approximate channel for the trading price of Bitcoin.\nTake a look at just how accurate those price channels have proven to be, as well as what that means for the future price of Bitcoin…\nThe lower bound of the channel is the point where the trading price of Bitcoin matches the breakeven price for the miners, seen on the chart as 1x.\nThe center of the channel is the historical average of this ratio, which has been 1.8x. In other words, Bitcoin historically has traded at 1.8 times the breakeven price for the miners.\n\"Millionaire-Maker\": A potential upgrade taking place behind the scenes could send the Bitcoin price to unprecedented highs. Few people even know about this game changer. Click here to learn how you could make millions…\nDespite the steep drop in the Bitcoin price over the past five months, the price is still very near this middle line – just about where it should be. The chart suggests last fall's price spike was indeed a bubble bound for a much-needed correction.\nThe upper bound of the channel is 3.2x. Fundstrat Head of Research Sam Doctor based this on the standard deviation. For the most part, this line has served as an upper bound on the Bitcoin price .\nOver the past five years, the chart's channels have been surprisingly on target – a good sign for the forward projections, which reflect trends we're seeing in Bitcoin mining.\nDoctor expects hash power – the measure of the computing muscle used in Bitcoin mining – to rise 350% by 2019. That will require heavy capital expenditures by the miners to keep up, raising the breakeven price as the chart predicts.\nThat's good news for the price of Bitcoin.\n\"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Doctor said in his report. The top and bottom of the range are projections of the upper and lower bound lines (the 1x and 3.2x lines).\nThe historical average line (the 1.8 line) suggests a price of $36,000.

Related Stories Bitcoin Home Buyer? 8 Houses You Can Snag Now With Cryptocurrency\n“I wanted to reach an audience that doesn’t have as many opportunities to put their investment in real estate,” the home’s real estate salesperson and owner Susan Vanech, said. “It was really to reach an audience that is otherwise ignored in the world of commerce.”\nVanech, a Fairfield resident, works for William Pitt Sotheby’s International Realty out of its Westport office and together with her husband, Matt Brodtman, owns Vanbrodt Estates LLC, a real estate company that for the past nine years has invested in buying, selling and renovating homes in the Westport area.\nIn 2016, Vanech and her husband bought 5 Ridgewood Lane for $575,000 and renovated the home with Fairfield-based Tiago Building Group. The property, listed at 250 bitcoin or $1,648,000, recently won a Home Builders & Remodelers Association of Connecticut (HOBI) award for its mix of classic farmhouse style and modern technological elements.\nCryptocurrencies, essentially electronic tokens with no physical backing that can be sent digitally to users around the world, have been around for about a decade, Norwalk resident Fior Lostumbo, founder of Cryptos and Cocktails, a local group organized to share knowledge of cryptocurrencies, said.\n“The grandfather of cryptocurrency,” bitcoin was invented by an anonymous individual in 2009 but isn’t managed by one person but rather has become a system of millions of programs who make the system stronger and bigger each day, Lostumbo said.\n“It’s such a unique home. That was part of the inspiration to reach out to the crypto community because the design elements in the home are innovative and unlike most of the traditional homes at this price-point. The crypto community is also very innovative in their thinking so I felt the home is a very good match,” Vanech said of 5 Ridgewood Lane, which is the first home she’s putting on the market with the option to pay in cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum.\nLostumbo said he’s excited about the potential for Fairfield County to join the cryptocurrency real estate market already on the rise in places such as San Francisco and New York City.\nThe value of bitcoin fell from a high of $20,000 for one bitcoin last year to $7,000 to $8,000 for one bitcoin over the last several months, but that’s only because, like the stock of a popular company that goes public, bitcoin prices launched to stratospheric levels and inevitably came down over the last year, which lost people money, Lostumbo said.\n“I do believe in it as a futuristic form of payment and I believe it will be the future,” Lostumbo said of cryptocurrency, which he said will prevail in the market for their ability to decentralize information and control away from a particular government agency or company.\nPiper Moretti also believes in the future of cryptocurrency, so much so that she co-founded the Crypto Realty Group based in Los Angeles in 2017, after closing her first deal for more than 700 bitcoin, or $3.2 million.\nThe group of global real estate agents were the first to bring cryptocurrency into the real estate market in southern California and helps crypto buyers and sellers in the U.S. and abroad, according to its website.\nMoretti said she recently closed her fifth deal using cryptocurrency in January.\n“Cryptocurrency is not going anywhere,” Moretti said. “But it’s like a toddler learning how to walk. It's going to walk, it just has to find its footing.”\nOn the market for two weeks, Vanech’s listing has so far received six offers and none for payment with cryptocurrency. Still, Vanech, like Lostumbo, believes in the future of cryptocurrency in the real estate market.\n“Sotheby’s is an international company that deals in international currencies, so I want to be at the forefront of introducing one that’s not associated with a particular country but rather a concept,” Vanech said.\nReporting contributed by Stephanie Kim.\nsvaughan@hearstmediact.com; 203-842-22638; @SophieCVaughan1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sophie vaughan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "westport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:05:50.060+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd8b2e9abed5dfdc8d2e5fb1cf72151a260d3cce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhDOTL85lepNGGG0qx1GlMws-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T22:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd8b2e9abed5dfdc8d2e5fb1cf72151a260d3cce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhDOTL85lepNGGG0qx1GlMws-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T22:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 31, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin : DOJ Probe To Decimate Liquidity Seeking Alpha DOJ probe follows the Tether probe in January.

This Scottish rehabilitation hospital can help", "text": "By Ed Oswald\nContent Provided by\nIf you find yourself taking the “hold on for dear life,” or HODL, stance toward cryptocurrency to the extreme , and can’t help yourself when it comes to buying cryptocurrency, you may be addicted. That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month.\nExperts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nSimilar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, the hospital says .\nCastle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately.\nThe help is not cheap: according to WikiTribune , Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says itoffers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.\nAddicted to your smartphone?

The catalyst for that divergence, he suggested to CNBC , is investors understanding the siloed use cases that each project has to offer. “There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies. It’s early, over time you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,” Garlinghouse told CNBC. The manner in which Garlinghouse describes the independent use cases for the numerous digital assets resembles that of unique asset classes in the broader financial markets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. If the bitcoin price performance were to no longer trade in tandem with the broader crypto market, this may suggest that there would be separate asset classes under the cryptocurrency umbrella. Meanwhile, if you ask Garlinhouse, of the 1,500-plus digital currencies that are being traded, only 1% of them will be around in a decade. “There’s gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don’t actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,” Garlinghouse told CNBC. Garlinghouse is at the helm of blockchain startup Ripple, which owns most of the XRP cryptocurrency and is the No. 3 digital currency by market cap. While altcoins tend to jockey for position, none have been able to knock bitcoin out of its top spot. Some market participants are anticipating No. 2 cryptocurrency Ethereum will do so, an event that’s been dubbed a flippening. Early Innings Meanwhile, the first quarter of 2018 was a mixed bag for cross-border payments startup Ripple. The company set new records operationally, but the XRP coin that’s tied to it was sent reeling. XRP lost nearly three-quarters of its value in Q1 2018. The bitcoin price was about halved in Q1. Garlinghouse pointed out that it remains early innings for the industry, while others maintain the cryptocurrency market remains in the pre-game stage. “It’s still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity. I think it’s a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases,” Garlinhouse told CNBC. On the operational side, Ripple couldn’t have done better. The company signed nearly two dozen first-time production contracts, a record pace for the payments startup. Among its new partners is Islamic lender Kuwait Finance House as CCN previously reported . Ripple inked a partnership with MoneyGram earlier this year in which the remittance company is piloting the payments platform. Featured image from Flickr.

As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward — this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting: The red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply. Vice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market. Points 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000–$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It’s impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait. Summary: The market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move. There is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. Symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward — this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting: The red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply. Vice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market. Points 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000–$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It’s impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait. Summary: The market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move. There is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. Symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinmagazine.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:21:41.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95bfac8ceb6fb9db456c32a64ef311f0ff4d5ae5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme0HVWQT5v5TGeAekEtzLUQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Even more Confusion now, Bitcoin Core has been created", "title_full": "Even more Confusion now, Bitcoin Core has been created", "published": "2018-05-31T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95bfac8ceb6fb9db456c32a64ef311f0ff4d5ae5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme0HVWQT5v5TGeAekEtzLUQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KingScorpio", "published": "2018-05-31T21:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Even more Confusion now, Bitcoin Core has been created", "text": "Roger ver named bitcoin on his website bitcoin core and bitcoin cash as the true legitimate bitcoin,\nbut now a group has figured out that bitcoin core has no name so it created bitcoin core to sell it\nhttps://btcmanager.com/new-bitcoin-core-creators-praise-roger-ver-as-their-best-advocate/\nwhat is bitcoin now? bitcoin cash, bitcoin core or bitcoin core?\ngood luck with this.\nregards", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://btcmanager.com/new-bitcoin-core-creators-praise-roger-ver-as-their-best-advocate/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T00:59:30.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a96f8ff885acc837a5d2bd3e0c7315659c558183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSGSEmHr7ZdPMrxc1C7gaC0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How to earn bitcoin?", "title_full": "How to earn bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-31T21:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a96f8ff885acc837a5d2bd3e0c7315659c558183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSGSEmHr7ZdPMrxc1C7gaC0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eraldo Coil", "published": "2018-05-31T21:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to earn bitcoin?", "text": "You can earn bitcoin using this forum with the use of campaigns, you can use trading to earn bitcoin, you can invest in bitcoin and hold it for a long time and you can earn profit right away, and lastly, you can mine bitcoins with the use of GPUs.

And in fact today, in my opinion, such crypto-currencies as Ether, Dash, Ripple, Litecoin, NEM, Monero and others really create value, and their price is due not only to pure speculation.\nAs for bitcoin, the fantastic increase in its value in recent times, of course, does not cease to excite the minds of critics, but in reality it's quite simple with him.\nThe first and most obvious difference between bitcoin and the financial pyramid is that there is no central beneficiary. Theoretically, of course, there are very old wallets with a very large number of bitcoins, which in some sense can be considered such a beneficiary. However, there was no official central beneficiary, and without its presence the pyramid does not make sense.\nThe second important difference is in bitcoin with the growth of the user base and with the growth of downloaded money, the value grows, because in any economic system this value is directly related to the number of participants in this system. Moreover, given the fact that the volume of the economy is always proportional to the square of the number of participants, and not to the number itself, the value of bitcoin grows much faster than the user base grows, and it is not necessary to talk about inflating a bubble.\nAnd, at last, one more factor is that at bitcoin there are no obligations to anyone. That is, bitcoin never promised anything to anyone, so bitcoin as a pyramid, in general, can not collapse. Bitcoin is only a financial protocol for making, validating and storing information about transactions among network members. The bitcoin code is publicly available, each participant can explore the logic of the entire network, and some participants can not just grab the bitcoins of other participants.\nGiven all of the above, I can conclude that bitcoin does not fall under the definition of the financial pyramid.\nWhat do u think about what do you think about my thoughts? Do u agree that bitcoin is not a financial pyramid?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T21:19:36.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ced4c3e70a7c5e3ee052292eefbc930455f30f94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3exievrMIJM2afR.LC9KCl0CZpGcGw5eD8XWG7WcltF_BEosyGKFQArH0opZyMbeJajT_2HTv4NVP7Lmy0yKN1dQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Bittrex Gets Bank Agreement to Help You Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "title_full": "Bittrex Gets Bank Agreement to Help You Buy Bitcoin With Dollars : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-05-31T21:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.474, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ced4c3e70a7c5e3ee052292eefbc930455f30f94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3exievrMIJM2afR.LC9KCl0CZpGcGw5eD8XWG7WcltF_BEosyGKFQArH0opZyMbeJajT_2HTv4NVP7Lmy0yKN1dQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laeh", "published": "2018-05-31T21:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bittrex Gets Bank Agreement to Help You Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "text": "submitted by /u/Laeh\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-31/bittrex-gets-bank-agreement-to-help-you-buy-bitcoin-with-dollars"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T18:45:25.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b16384c45ea9bafac5e6fd635d67c298b26ac26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg85qWuJfkMDQuIviEZvGJRiKsinaTCMVUU9p5Ihk3DFQ0rlxeIEdmcliL5.Rijulie4F8h1rSrsFiOIixODlLEqNrRQW81fNnqAI9TNLeQitNg49KzpUZzCDDrOK3yA3QjExOLJ60YEVQ--", "site_full": "www.realclearmarkets.com", "site": "realclearmarkets.com", "site_section": "http://m.realclearmarkets.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "RealClearMarkets -

But one of the recent types – raising awareness of Bitcoin's environmental unsustainability – has engaged me. As it turns out, I have an unusual background to bring to this topic, and I think I should contribute.\nSo, here we go:\nAnother Apocalypse?\nLet's be honest and admit that most of the \"environmental movement\" sells fear of an apocalypse. And as we should all realize by now, humans have an innate weakness for fear.\nMore or less every apocalyptic environmental prediction has failed. (I'm talking about those that could actually be measured, obviously.) That won't stop the fear-sellers of course, and now Bitcoin has come into their sights.\nThe fear is that because crypto mining uses so much power, it will bring down the grid or cause various environmental disasters. The advocates of this fear throw around scary sounding numbers (measured in terawatts) and assorted scientific terminology. (\"They understand it and you don't… don't expose yourself to ridicule.\")\nBut it's mostly just fear. Sure, proof-of-work sucks up power, but that's nothing new. How much power do you suppose all those millions of air conditioners suck up every summer? I haven't dug up the figures, but I'm ready to take bets that it's several times more than crypto mining. Shall we now fear the air conditioner?\nFurther Factors\nI worked for decades in the electrical industry, and so I'd like to give you some facts from that perspective:\nPower use has been going up since the beginning. These days most houses get 200 amperes of electrical service. But there are still thousands of houses that are wired with only 60 amperes. That was plenty 60 years ago. New loads (devices using power) come along all the time. In just my time, we've added air conditioning, microwaves, and lots of computers.\nMining is a nice, steady load. The kind power companies thrive on. What makes their lives crazy are seasonal loads like air conditioning, which occur only a few months per year.\nPower failures happen every year, especially in summer due to the aforementioned air conditioning load. It's a good bet that several fear-sellers have press releases ready to go for this summer.\nThe utilities are making money on this. More power use means more income.\nIf people use too much power, the providers will raise their prices. Econ 101.\nAnd the Big One\nCryptocurrencies don't finance war.\nThe public hasn't actually paid for a war since WW2. Since then the whole game's been run on credit. (The same goes, more or less, for everything Big Guv does to save us poor, helpless sheep.)\nWith Bitcoin and all the cryptos that I know of, you can't do such things. If you want to throw a war in a crypto-based economy, you'll have to convince people to pay for it. Good luck. * * * * *\nA book that generates comments like these, from actual readers, might be worth your time:\nI just finished reading The Breaking Dawn and found it to be one of the most thought-provoking, amazing books I have ever read… It will be hard to read another book now that I've read this book… I want everyone to read it.\nSuch a tour de force, so many ideas. And I am amazed at the courage to write such a book, that challenges so many people's conceptions.\nThere were so many points where it was hard to read, I was so choked up.\nHoly moly! I was familiar with most of the themes presented in A Lodging of Wayfaring Men , but I am still trying to wrap my head around the concepts you presented at the end of this one.\nGet it at Amazon ($18.95) or on Kindle : ($5.99) * * * * *", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01BTHF1ME", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0979987768", "https://www.freemansperspective.com/tag/bitcoin/", "https://www.freemansperspective.com/tag/cryptocurrency/", "https://www.freemansperspective.com/tag/crypto/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:47:06.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c8d746843ad34ba5cdc5fc9f64d2bf398425eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYAtRdlVzh2Xxg_FxTyWzluM0oSIsbMedP4KZQ3mpvZwB5MbDIAkrkQyNlci.m8lwUlH6qSrXzSxgLd6AAv7yymG", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/topic/lifestyle", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Health &amp; Lifestyle", "title": "Bitcoin addict?

This Scottish rehabilitation hospital can help", "text": "Can't help yourself when it comes to Bitcoin? Castle Craig Hospital is starting to treat cryptocurrency addicts like gambling addicts, and the hospital thinks it can help you break the \"hold on for dear life,\" or HODL, trap. More If you find yourself taking the “hold on for dear life,” or HODL, stance toward cryptocurrency to the extreme , and can’t help yourself when it comes to buying cryptocurrency, you may be addicted. That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month.\nExperts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nSimilar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, the hospital says .\nCastle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately.\nThe help is not cheap: according to WikiTribune , Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says it offers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.\nAddicted to your smartphone?

Both organizations are seeking to develop a stronger, more organized system for allowing charities to accept virtual currency donations.\nBitGive previously made headlines in October 2017 when it launched its new GiveTrack platform, which uses blockchain technology to clarify and record digital asset donations to global charities. Individuals can trace their funds in real time, and see how their money is spent once an organization receives it. They are also informed of the charity’s project results, creating direct engagement between the donor and the receiver.\nBitGive’s founder Connie Gallippi explained in a statement:\n“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped shape the development of our platform and define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionize the charitable sector.”\nBitGive and the University of Edinburgh are seeking to uncover the challenges of using and converting cryptocurrencies in third-world countries. To do this, BitGive will analyze data collected from GiveTrack’s implementations in nations like Indonesia, Kenya and India to better understand these regions’ levels of cryptocurrency acceptance and feasibility.\nIn addition, both organizations are also hoping collected data will shed light on merchant adoption, regulation, and the effects of cryptocurrencies on local governments and cultures in each country.\nResearch partner at the University of Edinburgh Dr. Claudia Pagliari says:\n“Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through our research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can ultimately influence the success of these approaches so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programs worldwide.” Open Mind Africa\nThis week, BitGive also launched its latest charitable project partnership with Open Mind Africa , aiming to raise funds to support a Summer Camp and Educator Summit in Ghana, where students will have “fantastic opportunities to develop essential social-emotional skills, multiple intelligences, build friendships and make memories that will last a lifetime.” Now in its second year, the camp is also inviting educators and facilitators from the U.S. and Australia, as well as Ghana.\nOpen Mind Africa was founded on a firm belief that there is a better future for Africa if we promote a quality education rooted in essential skills needed to succeed in school, career and life.\nPast projects that BitGive has successfully funded and supported in the past include the Maternal & Neonatal India Program , the Chandolo Primary School Water Project and the Shisango Girls School .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.givetrack.org/view/13/chandolo-primary-school-water-project", "https://www.givetrack.org/view/50/maternal-neonatal-india-program", "https://www.givetrack.org/view/8/shisango-girls-school-example-project", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "https://www.givetrack.org/view/55/open-mind-africa-2018-summer-camp-educator-summit-ghana", "https://www.bitgivefoundation.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "connie gallippi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:21:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1379eaac7b42262f832fbe08df3108408fa8f93a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jxADXj_ODr4lfTK.vu3aX0iUxg9wF2K.MkfxZsz7pAkVcu1JfUdT9Wry68DnLKP_mgd9eajhJpjK5yruTqHHxFAxU3e_p7KkGL8QmMKNDehNTQ25l6QftaQ--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen", "title_full": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen", "published": "2018-05-31T21:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81YmU2YTczYWJlNWMxOTc5YmE4ZWUyNTQ2MTZmNzZhYS5qcGc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1379eaac7b42262f832fbe08df3108408fa8f93a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jxADXj_ODr4lfTK.vu3aX0iUxg9wF2K.MkfxZsz7pAkVcu1JfUdT9Wry68DnLKP_mgd9eajhJpjK5yruTqHHxFAxU3e_p7KkGL8QmMKNDehNTQ25l6QftaQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cointelegraph", "published": "2018-05-31T21:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen", "text": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen May 31, 2018 233 Brad Garlinghouse , CEO of Ripple (XRP), thinks that Bitcoin’s (BTC) influence on cryptocurrency market prices will eventually decrease, CNBC reported yesterday, May 30. Garlinghouse, referring to cryptocurrency as a “nascent industry,” told reporters that “over time, you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,” adding:\n“There’s gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don’t actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out.”\nDuring a conference this week, Garlinghouse spoke of Bitcoin’s future as potentially ending up like the now defunct music service Napster, TechCrunch reported yesterday. He noted that Napster “showed us what’s possible, but in the end, it was Spotify and iTunes and Pandora that won the day because they engaged with regulators.”\nRipple’s CEO also spoke to CNBC about crypto and securities regulation in the U.S., in response to the fact that a former U.S. government regulator said last month that both Ripple and Ethereum (ETH) could likely be considered unregistered securities . In Garlinghouse’s opinion, the coin is not a security under U.S. law because owning XRP is not comparable with owning stock in a company:\n“If you own XRP, you don’t own rights to the profits or any dividends to the company. XRP has real utility.”\nHowever, Garlinghouse did note that the company has been “an advocate of ‘yes, the government should get involved,’” stating: “The SEC is getting involved as they should because there have been frauds committed […] the government should be protecting investors and companies but there’s also examples of real utility.”\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently launched “Operation Cryptosweep,” in collaboration with Canadian authorities, investigating potentially fraudulent crypto companies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). The SEC had also launched a probe into cryptocurrency business at the beginning of March.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/bitcoins-influence-over-cryptocurrency-prices-could-end-soon-says-ripple-ceo.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-and-canadian-securities-regulators-coordinate-ico-probe-in-operation-cryptosweep", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico", "https://top.cointelegraph.com/people/Brad-K.-Garlinghouse/", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-sec-launches-cryptocurrency-probe", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-us-govt-regulator-considers-eth-xrp-likely-noncompliant-securities", "https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/crypto-expert-says-we-wont-see-regulation-for-years/?utm_source=tctwreshare&sr_share=twitter", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pandora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T00:42:09.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1111f2c92f961e6b712ffc253bae1c2c9351c0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5rJqJHfFHpJw5XHD84DSnTsZshx.gnbwuD1CO593MYsm2eqVF3tHGL5tkVIJBPF8ZJVztK.yRoyqapa.AOMQII__puiC038f7Eo_FM9aBNoNedwXtqTtT0", "site_full": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Magazine", "title": "Bitcoin Nonprofit BitGive Announces New Project and Research Collaboration", "title_full": "Bitcoin Nonprofit BitGive Announces New Project and Research Collaboration", "published": "2018-05-31T21:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1111f2c92f961e6b712ffc253bae1c2c9351c0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5rJqJHfFHpJw5XHD84DSnTsZshx.gnbwuD1CO593MYsm2eqVF3tHGL5tkVIJBPF8ZJVztK.yRoyqapa.AOMQII__puiC038f7Eo_FM9aBNoNedwXtqTtT0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Marinoff", "published": "2018-05-31T21:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Nonprofit BitGive Announces New Project and Research Collaboration", "text": "05.31.18 2:28 PM Bitcoin Nonprofit BitGive Announces New Project and Research Collaboration\nBitGive — the globe’s first bitcoin-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit — has joined hands with the University of Edinburgh to research and examine the effects of digital currencies on both national and international charities.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.\nBecause they believe bitcoin will come in handy in the future then they continue to withhold the bitcoin they have until now.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T00:44:41.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d0a55f133f56490ef73ca27045ea3a5a5b3bd87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW6pRUjiK_byneTi85DLlb8g-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T21:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d0a55f133f56490ef73ca27045ea3a5a5b3bd87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW6pRUjiK_byneTi85DLlb8g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T21:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 31.

No matching symbol found{{/query}} {{/results}} Bitcoin: DOJ Probe To Decimate Liquidity May 31, 2018 1:22 PM Summary DOJ probe follows the Tether probe in January. Bitcoin's ownership distribution and trading volume shares characteristics with stock market securities which have been involved in SEC violations. Bitcoin's float is turned over more than once per day based on the latest 24-hour volume. If DOJ successfully identifies problematic trading activity, reported volume will decline. I expect a swift correction when liquidity decreases, not unlike what happened in 2008 in the mortgage market.\nBitcoin ( COIN , OTCQX:GBTC ) is feeling the heat again. I've long been suspicious of the asset's meteoric rise. In 2018, regulatory bodies are finally catching on. First, there was the investigation of Tether ( USDT-USD ), now the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Bitcoin price manipulation .\nIf you've read my previous articles on the topic, you probably know that I am immensely fearful of Bitcoin taking over major financial institutions such as banks and pension funds (read: The Bitcoin Poison Spreads ). It is my hope that this investigation will make them think really hard about getting involved with Bitcoin.\nBut what does it mean for the average Bitcoin holder? I believe that if DOJ identifies and shutters any problematic exchanges, there will be another flight for liquidity, similar to what happened after the investigation of Tether was announced.\n1-week chart after news broke on Jan. 30, 2018\nHow likely is it that DOJ will find problematic trading activity? I believe that the probability is very high. Let's review some facts.\nSince all Bitcoin addresses are public, we can analyze the distribution of Bitcoin wealth.\nSource: bitinfocharts.com\nWe can see that 3.2% of all Bitcoin addresses hold 95.94% of the assets. This means that ownership is extremely concentrated. If we use the stock market as a reference, high insider ownership, and low float stocks are often breeding grounds for irregular trading activities. Low float leads to low liquidity, and low liquidity means that at any point in time there aren't enough dollars to match incoming market orders. This means that the immediate impact of market orders is greatly exaggerated, potentially allowing speculators (often those with ill intent) to rapidly influence the market price despite relatively limited inflows. The drastic price movement may then cause more investors to chase momentum in what appears to be the \"next big thing\", causing a snowball effect that originated from basically nothing.\nMarket principles can be applied across different asset classes; after all, human nature is the driver of every single market in the short term. Let's study a couple of examples to see how low float securities typically trade. PHI Inc. ( PHII , PHIIK ) has two classes of shares. PHIIK is the ticker for the non-voting shares and PHII is the ticker for the voting shares held by insiders. The float of PHII is 611 thousand shares out of 2.91 million shares in total or 21%. The 30-day average volume according to Bloomberg is 4,723 shares or 0.8% of the float. Seaboard's ( SEB ) stock also has a low float, with 78% of the total 1.17 million shares held by insiders. According to Bloomberg, the 30-day average volume is just 302 shares or 0.1% of the float. Evidently, a low float stock will have low liquidity.\nNow let's take a look at a more interesting and now well-known low float stock: LongFin ( OTCPK:LFIN ). The company is currently under investigation; its shares have been delisted from NASDAQ and is currently trading OTC.\nAccording to the 10-K filed on April 2, 2018, only 1.14 million shares were sold during the IPO compared to a total share base of 44.54 million as of April. This meant that the float was just 2.6% when it IPOed! Soon after LongFin went public, the stock skyrocketed to as high as $142, a 28x increase over the IPO price of $5. Now, what about the volume? When the stock hit its intraday high on December 18, 2017, a whopping 23.99 million shares exchanged hands over two days. That is 21x the float!\nSource: Yahoo Finance\nHow do low float and abnormal volume work together? You can read for yourself in this Harvard research report, but the logic is very simple. A low float allows a small amount of money to move the market price and a bit more money will lead to extreme price movements. This doesn't happen with stocks with large floats because there are enough buyers and sellers for shares to exchange hands at the last price.\nNow let's look at Bitcoin's reported volume. Using data from the top 212 exchanges according to coinmarketcap.com , the 24-hour volume at the time of writing was 883,143 Bitcoins. Using the Bitcoin wealth distribution table at the beginning of the article, we will find that the float of Bitcoin is 778,586 Bitcoins if we use 3.2% of all addresses with the largest holdings as the cut-off for \"insiders.\" This means that the float of Bitcoin is turned over more than once every day. Similar to Longfin, it is much higher than what one would typically expect of a low float security. Is this evidence that Bitcoin's trading is irregular? As I've stated in my earlier articles on potential Bitcoin manipulation through Tether , we will never find proof because we are outsiders. It is only when law enforcement starts looking will the truth reveal itself. However, that doesn't mean we can't analyze whatever public information we have, and the research so far leads me to believe that trading in Bitcoin may have indeed been irregular.\nIf you disagree with my assessment of the situation, there are still plenty of other things to worry about. We already know that there are groups dedicated to pumping cryptocurrencies , but did you also know that an independent study published on the Journal of Monetary Economics stated that a single actor was likely responsible for the price manipulation that preceded Bitcoin's massive run? Price manipulation in any form increase liquidity in the short-run, but history shows us that it doesn't last forever. Bitcoin's 2008\nWhat happens when the problematic liquidity is removed? Let's first understand the implication of the illusion of abundant liquidity. The illusion of liquidity allows investors to sleep at night and encourages them to \"hodl\". If you know that tomorrow you can transform $10 million of Bitcoin into cash without a problem, you are unlikely to sell. All the numbers that you see on different exchanges tell you the same thing: there is no need to worry. Many investors will have this false sense of security. However, when everyone realizes that the plentiful liquidity is an illusion, they will collectively sell at the same time, causing a crash.\nI'm not breaking new ground here. Any investor that lived through 2008 can draw the parallel between Bitcoin and toxic assets. There were times when there was ample liquidity in the secondary mortgage market (i.e. where loans are bought and sold by investors). But then one day, IndyMac was unable to offload $10 billion of loans . The rest is history.\nI believe that if DOJ successfully prosecutes large Bitcoin exchanges, the regulatory body will single-handedly pull the rug from under Bitcoin investors' feet. Everybody will understand the sham that has been going on at the same time. The lucky few will sell first, with the rest holding the bag.\nWith DOJ's involvement, I foresee an \"IndyMac moment\" in the Bitcoin market as regulatory pressure intensifies. Conclusion\nI applaud the government's investigation into any manipulative trading in Bitcoin. While I remain frightened by the speed at which Wall Street is embracing Bitcoin, I believe that the potential decline in liquidity will greatly reduce Bitcoin's attractiveness to institutions.\nBased on my experience with stocks, Bitcoin's low float and high volume are hallmarks of questionable trading activities. Similar to my concern with Tether , which ultimately culminated in an official investigation, I believe that the current evidence strongly supports my position that something is fishy with Bitcoin.

It's about the bubble.\nMaybe I still don't get it, but I'm still inclined to be prudent. Better opportunities lie elsewhere beyond the back side of an asset bubble. You just don’t get it! This is a common refrain that gets uttered during periods of market excitement. Asset prices become dislocated to the upside beyond any reasonable underlying fundamental reason. And when such extreme pricing behavior is brought into light, it is often refuted with the exclamation that “you just don’t get it” followed by a discussion about effectively why this time is different in that extreme prices are not only fully justified but should continue to rise to the stars. Everyone loves a good party. But no matter how much fun everyone might be having, all good parties always come to an end. And the more epic the party, the more painful the subsequent hangover often turns out to be. Cryptocurrencies are a recent bubble to strike financial markets . Back in January, I wrote that cryptocurrencies were in a bubble of epic proportions . Quickly putting the magnitude of the bubble into context, the price of Bitcoin had increased by a staggering 18 times more than the Nasdaq Composite, leading up to the peak of the technology bubble in 2000. More simply, what was taking place in cryptocurrencies was exponentially larger than arguably the most notorious stock market bubble in history. You just don’t get it! Despite this deeply troublesome comparison, the justifications for why the upside in cryptocurrencies was just getting started were notable. The following is a brief sampling of some of the sentiments being expressed at the time.\n“Best that investors not be the judge of bitcoin and crypto. Those who judge its fall are sour that they missed the massive returns, because they scoffed at it years ago.” This is not an uncommon counterargument during bubbly times. Those who are bullish may seek comfort in the fact that detractors may be raising warning flags simply driven by their lament that they did not participate in the previously lavish gains. I suppose some might also begrudge their neighbor for holding a winning Powerball lottery ticket. But such a counterargument is about as reassuring and fundamentally sound as the underlying assets in which they are invested in this case.\n“You most likely don’t understand the tech and simply dismiss it.”\n“I don't think you understand what cryptocurrency is. It seems lazy to compare the boom and bust cycles of equity and commodity-driven markets to the emergence of decentralized IMMUTABLE currency.” These criticisms are fair. Perhaps I did not get it at the time. And I may very well not get it today. But here are the things I do know. I do not doubt the technology . In fact, I actually think that cryptocurrencies may ultimately be what supplants the current fiat currency system before it is all said and done. With that said, it is not likely to do so for at least another decade, if not longer. And when it does, most if not all of the cryptocurrencies in circulation today are likely to have become defunct long ago similar to so many of the dot.com stocks that rose with the tech bubble in the late 1990s. The Internet is here to stay two decades later, but most of the companies at its dawn are now long forgotten. It’s not about the technology, it’s about the speculative bubble . Whether I’m simply just grumpy because I missed out on the upside, whether I understand the underlying technology or not, it simply does not matter. Whether it is dot.com stocks in early 2000, biotech and China stocks in the summer of 2014 or cryptocurrencies in late 2016, I know what a bubble looks like. And the primary explanatory factor that has determined cryptocurrency prices for the last few years has been patterns of bubble behavior that have been repeated over and over again since the dawn of capitalism. Cryptocurrencies have another intrinsic problem . Beyond the fact that they ran 18 times hotter than tech stocks during their boom, cryptocurrencies suffer from a few important fundamental and characteristic problems. First , most cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything. OK, one could say the same about fiat currencies today. But fiat currencies have the advantage of being backed by the full faith and credit (whatever that’s worth today) of issuing governments. Cryptocurrencies are not. Second , they are not yet used in any measurable way as a medium of exchange. Would the flow of commerce be somehow stunted if cryptocurrencies ceased to exist tomorrow? Essentially no. While they may eventually change the world, they remain mostly nothing more than a novelty today. And an expensive novelty at that. Third , they remain mostly unregulated. Cryptocurrencies may someday attain the status of an established asset class. But this is years away at least. Until the category attains some level of structure and order that institutional investors can reasonably base sound decision making on behalf of the clients for which they maintain a fiduciary responsibility, the category will remain in the speculative badlands of capital markets. Such regulation does not necessarily need to be imposed by a government body, as it may ultimately be self governing. But as the ongoing and various instances of fraud in the cryptocurrency space suggest, the category remains well removed from arriving at such a point. Lastly and perhaps most importantly , what cryptocurrencies represent fly directly in the face of the interests of global governments and their highly influential central banks. If global governments lose control of the fiat currency system, they subsequently lose control of the global financial system and its markets. In short, they lose power. As a result, even if cryptocurrencies were to continue to rise, we should fully expect at some point that global governments will eventually move to crush them into a fine powder to protect their turf. Remember what happened to gold and silver starting back in 2011? This will likely be mild compared to what governments would do to cryptocurrencies if they rise to the point where they are starting to replace fiat currencies in any meaningful way. Cryptocurrencies continue to fall down the other side of a steep mountain . Cryptocurrencies were in a bubble. And that bubble burst on December 18, 2017. Since that time, the trend in price has been definitively down. For just as bubbles inflate in similar fashion, so too do they unwind just as infamously. The price has already fallen by as much as -65% from its peak and is still down as much as -60% through today and falling with each passing week. The relative strength and momentum behind the price of cryptocurrencies is all but gone, and what was once technical support is becoming increasingly heavy resistance. Will we see swift countertrend rallies? Absolutely, but so did the Nasdaq when it was descending from its 2000 peaks. The price was much lower not that long ago . It is important to remember that it was just 14 months ago when Bitcoin was trading at less than $1,000. In the time since, it arguably has the same intrinsic value today that it had then, which some might contend is virtually nil. Not that it won’t change the world someday in the future, but not today nor any time soon. Yet it is still trading above $7,000 despite having already fallen by more than -60% from its peak. Maybe I still don’t get it . Perhaps I’m still nothing more than an investor that's smarting having missed out on the awesome run to the upside. Then again, I never lamented not owning a basket of dot.com stocks in the late 1990s and haven’t found myself losing sleep about not owning Bitcoin or its brethren in recent years, but maybe I’m burying my feelings. I do think I get the technology, however, and think it has great potential to change the world someday. But the markets will open and close each and every day in the meantime. Continue to tread carefully in cryptocurrencies . It remains more than possible that cryptocurrencies could bottom and begin rising anew. But we are now more than five months and -60% into an unwinding of a bubble that at least to this point shows absolutely no signs of abating in its move to the downside. Until we begin to see any evidence of a stabilization and turn in cryptocurrency prices, it is best to exercise prudence and seek upside opportunities elsewhere, as even better entry points to own this transformative technology may ultimately present themselves before it is all said and done.

While that’s all fine and good, it kind of misses the point. As I explained via a Sopranos reference , asking if there’s manipulation going on in cryptocurrencies is like asking if there’s prostitution going on at the Bada Bing! . That is, of course there’s manipulation in that market. But the larger issue is that the whole damn thing is suspect. Going after Bitcoin spoofers is like arresting hookers at the Bing . You’re missing the forest for the trees. I joke a lot about the absurdity inherent in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and proponents of the market don’t do themselves any favors by doing shit that reinforces stereotypes (see here and here , for instance). But in all seriousness, there is virtually no chance these “assets” survive in their current form. That doesn’t mean the concept of cryptocurrencies and/or the theoretical underpinnings of the market are going away, but it does mean that if you’re betting on, say, Bitcoin in its current form to rally unimpeded to infinity on the way to supplanting traditional currencies printed by developed market central banks, you are a moron. Plain and simple. It ain’t gonna happen. One person who agrees is Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller (and really I don’t even know why I bother because citing mainstream economists in an effort to convince cryptocurrency acolytes they’re wrong is an exercise in futility by definition), who earlier this week chatted with CNBC about what the future is likely to look like for Bitcoin. His overarching message was that it might well just go the way of the dinosaurs, but he couched it in friendlier terms than that. To wit: Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not. Yes, “a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.” Of course that assumes it still exists in one form or another and while, as alluded to above, it’s likely the concept isn’t going away, it’s possible that it will, in which case there will be no “dispute” and the only people claiming it’s still around will be the people who swear to Christ that Megalodon is still swimming around out there somewhere. In any event, the punchline to the whole Shiller video comes when he describes an exchange he had with a student who insisted on keeping his laptop open during finals so he could ensure he didn’t miss an “opportunity” to trade fucking Bitcoin.... MORE , including video. * As noted, kind of fond of old Doc Shiller. Here's his his September 4, 2007 call: Some U.S. Housing Markets could drop 50%- Shiller In addition to publishing \"Irrational Exuberance\" in March, 2000 with the NASDAQ hitting its all time closing high of 5048 (subsequent low 1114, how's a 78% decline grab ya?) he is the keeper of the Cowles Commission records .* From one of our Forecasting Equity Returns posts: A subject near and dear to my heart.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

I need customers to be able to pay in bitcoins. But for some reasons I cannot use existing solutions like Bitpay .\nTherefore I have thought and ended up with the following solution. We have a private key wallet of HD type, so we can generate child addresses from our master key. When a user tries to pay in Bitcoins we are generating a new address and display it to the user. We associate an address with an order id A daemon running in background is checking pending orders requesting information from Blockchain for a concrete address and checking whether this address received amount equal to an order total sum. In case there are more than X confirmations we are setting a status of an order to PAID\nI wonder whether this is acceptable solutions or maybe there are some better ways to implement custom bitcoin payments ?\nI would be great for any suggestions and help.\nThanks", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitpay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:04:16.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35be31dfc4d2ab4768d74f2d5192438fd2fe8c22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfVtyYPOfbQjjKtDTNlSmJ0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-31T21:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35be31dfc4d2ab4768d74f2d5192438fd2fe8c22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfVtyYPOfbQjjKtDTNlSmJ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tugsukana", "published": "2018-05-31T21:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "text": "Why do people still buy Bitcoin?\npeople will be interested in buying because it takes, not unlike with people who buy bitcoin at this time because people need bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T17:53:56.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cef818b8ce7d821393f9ef4ea766864dca36bc6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfYRUv5uAoVDRbSgQYXjwLkFzdn5Trkd6AOa1GIEKOD7j", "site_full": "www.coinflip.tech", "site": "coinflip.tech", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Please help find the vandal terrorizing our bitcoin ATMs in Vegas/Houston! $3,000 USD reward for information leading to an arrest.

Big businesses, including Intel, IBM and Microsoft, as well as countless startups, are betting hard on the technology. But scams, confusion, hype and gyrating valuations make it hard to assess what's a good idea.\nGarlinghouse is pretty clear he thinks the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, is now in the bad idea category, at least for its original use, a replacement for ordinary money. Bitcoin's blockchain ledger records transactions on a global network of computers that no single entity controls. But actually buying something is a problem, he said.\n\"People talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee,\" Garlinghouse said. \"The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.\"\nGarlinghouse, unsurprisingly, thinks his company has a better alternative.\nRipple is one of the higher-profile startups in the world of cryptocurrency. Its XRP has the third-largest market capitalization after bitcoin and the Ethereum's Project's ether. The currency is set up for the finance world tasks like bank-to-bank money payments across borders that settle faster than conventional transfers. Ripple counts big names in banking like American Express, RBC, Santander and Credit Agricole as partners.\nThe value of Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP, has fluctuated dramatically over the last year.\nXRP hasn't been immune to volatility, though. And Ripple faces a lawsuit alleging that it violated securities laws in its handling of XRP.\nCutting transaction costs and speeding transaction times for banks might not be something the average person understands or gets excited about. But that doesn't mean it's not important, he says. \"That's a multi-trillion dollar problem,\" Garlinghouse said. \"I don't think blockchain is solving consumer problems yet.\"\nCompanies want blockchain to revolutionize everything from concert ticket sales and online betting to car maintenance records and carbon emission tracking. But Ripple is focusing on the relatively narrow job of cross-border payments.\n\"Blockchain has its own peanut butter problem,\" he said, referring to his famous 2006 memo criticizing his then employer, Yahoo, for being spread too thin. \"There are lots of industries that can be touched, but it starts with one.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-is-like-napster-important-flop-ripple-ceo-says/?part=propeller&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=link", "https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-is-like-napster-important-flop-ripple-ceo-says/?part=propeller&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=link"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:05:59.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9890a380d86c77b3e94419101a56dd9bd65da0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRbdxcvh2GGKwrc6HeJsSao-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "The FALL OF BITCOIN", "title_full": "The FALL OF BITCOIN", "published": "2018-05-31T20:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9890a380d86c77b3e94419101a56dd9bd65da0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRbdxcvh2GGKwrc6HeJsSao-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jason meneses", "published": "2018-05-31T20:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "The FALL OF BITCOIN", "text": "Quote: from: angelaurum on March 15, 2018, 06:33:28 AM It is very sad to say that a technology like this would come to a big tragedy\nBitcoin has the potential to be great but it has become a weapon of Greed\nThe real use of bitcoin as a payment system is just a fantasy\nBut what happens in reality, it is just a pump and dump coin like the rest\nThe only coin that is using blockchain technology the right way is USDT or Tether\nmost other coins are just scams and not meant for adaptability\nA currency is something that can be used for daily basis rather than just an investment\nmajority of people who buy bitcoin is just for investment and not used as a payment itself\nNever the less\nHAIL HYDRA!\nIt sounds funny how you constructively describe the bitcoin with pump and dump which is a fact and natural event on the digital world.

GMO to Launch In-Game Bitcoin Rewards System This Summer May 31, 2018 275 Japanese internet services giant GMO Internet Inc. announced it would debut its Bitcoin-based application for in-game rewards in August, Cointelegraph Japan reports May 31.\nThe application, called CryptoChips, acts as a method of rewarding players for achieving certain goals, and will initially launch solely with Bitcoin support.\nCryptoChips will reportedly first be implemented in GMO-developed real-time battle game Whimsical War.\n“GMO Internet […] has developed ‘CryptoChips by GMO’ that enables distribution of cryptocurrency as remuneration within the game application, and will offer it through a group company starting in August 2018,” an accompanying press release in English and Japanese confirms, adding:\n“CryptoChips can be mounted on the game application and allows players to receive cryptocurrency as remuneration within the game – like a ‘secret pocket money’– depending on the players’ rankings or when players have achieved missions or acquired items.”\nThe move is the latest venture into cryptocurrency for GMO, which already runs its own exchange, mining operation and even pays a portion of staff salaries in Bitcoin.\nIn March, the company’s exchange pledged to improve data security after regulators found its setup lacking during cross-industry inspections following January’s $530 mln hack of fellow Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck .\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

Shiller told CNBC's Trading Nation :\nBitcoin won't look anything like it is today [in 100 years]. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it'll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.\nIndeed, the amount of Bitcoin hard forks already in existence numbers above 30, and most notably includes the likes of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Bitcoin Private (BTCP). A whole slew of less noteworthy forks also exists, including irrelevant coins like Bitcoin God (GOD), Bitcoin All (BTA), and Bitcoin Smart (BCS). Meanwhile, more hard forks of the market leader are already planned, including Anonymous Bitcoin (ANON).\nOne may easily argue that the sheer amount of Bitcoin hard forks indeed does very little to benefit the most mainstream cryptocurrency. In fact, there remains a civil war of sorts between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) — the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization — with the latter actively making attempts to claim the Bitcoin name for itself while rebranding the former to Bitcoin Core.\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that a group of developers has recently embraced the Bitcoin Core moniker perpetuated by some Bitcoin Cash proponents — having launched a cryptocurrency under the same name (BTCC) while calling it the real open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash.\nFor those who have yet to dip their toes in Bitcoin's waters, the widespread co-opting of the market leader's name can be overwhelming — particularly when trying to figure out which is the \"real\" Bitcoin.\n'It Looks like a Bubble' Hard forks may not be the only reason Bitcoin dies in a century or so.\nShiller also claimed that the gold-standard of cryptocurrency could fade away into obscurity as times change. He explained:\nThe one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away.\nThe prominent economist also added that Bitcoin \"looks like a bubble,\" but still noted that nothing is certain, stating:\nIt's so hard to predict these things.\nPredicting Bitcoin's future is made even harder by the fact that the market leader itself is a voluntary monetary network, meaning every user chooses to play by the rules of consensus. The bigger the network gets, the harder it becomes to change said rules.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin will only tighten with future soft forks, offsetting the loosening of rules caused by controversial and irrelevant hard forks.\nWhere do you think Bitcoin will be in 100 years?
