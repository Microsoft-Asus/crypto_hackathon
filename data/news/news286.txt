There is a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may rise in the short term, but it is likely to face resistances near $8,900 and $9,000. Bitcoin price is facing tough barriers around $8,900-$9,000 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must stay above $8,200 and $8,000 to avoid any further losses in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Support This past week, there was a sharp bearish reaction from the $9,500 pivot level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and moved below the $9,000 and $8,500 support levels. The decline was such that the price traded towards the $8,200 level. It also broke a connecting bullish trend line at $9,000. A low was formed at $8,226 before buyers appeared. Later, the price started consolidating losses above $8,200 and is currently stable.\nIt tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low. It seems like the price is finding it hard to move above the $8,500 level, which is also a pivot level. Above the $8,500 level, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low is at $8,850. There is also a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, the price is likely to face sellers near the $8,500 and $8,900 levels. Once there is a proper close above $8,900 and $9,000, there could be more gains towards $9,500.\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is slightly bearish below $8,900. On the downside, the $8,200 level is a decent support, followed by $8,000. If bitcoin fails to hold $8,000, it could decline below $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is about to move into the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,900\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis – Can BTC/USD Hold $8,000? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T10:05:49.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70c7bf229293efc35d51d3a9a79864904acd5cbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiJay2eskP7qWZF6DGnqiXKJJF9xVFu6b2SnTDAMPvDZNtg0B9zCLKhgQi.D5yNUijbt0QcXfHJ3T", "site_full": "www.howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site": "howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site_section": "http://www.howbitcoinminingworks.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How Bitcoin Mining Works", "title": "Weekly Skeptics Discussion - May 13, 2018 | Pro&Con Contest topics: Bitcoin and BitcoinCash", "title_full": "Weekly Skeptics Discussion - May 13, 2018 | Pro&Con Contest topics: Bitcoin and BitcoinCash", "published": "2018-05-13T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70c7bf229293efc35d51d3a9a79864904acd5cbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiJay2eskP7qWZF6DGnqiXKJJF9xVFu6b2SnTDAMPvDZNtg0B9zCLKhgQi.D5yNUijbt0QcXfHJ3T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mosquito Control (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T10:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Weekly Skeptics Discussion - May 13, 2018 | Pro&Con Contest topics: Bitcoin and BitcoinCash", "text": "Welcome to the Weekly Skeptics Discussion thread.

Fundstrat’s technician Robert Sluymer says Bitcoin has bottomed with an upside seen from here.\nBlockchain Week New York to Trigger Next Bullish Momentum, Says Fundstrat Analyst\nThe most important annual conference for the cryptocurrency ecosystem is taking place in New York while Bitcoin sits just above the 50-day moving average.\nWhile the blockchain industry gets together to move the technology forward, digital currency investors wait on the sidelines and hope for the best.\nAccording to Robert Sluymer, managing director and head of technical research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, a lot of people are looking for clarity on projects as uncertainty around regulation still looms.\nHe added that it should all become clearer as ‘we move around Consensus.’ With regard to the technical analysis, Sluymer told CNBC that he expects Bitcoin to shake a few traders, but to hold around the 50-day average, which is fairly close to where we are now.\n“Bull-bear scenario developing where folks are arguing it’s getting lower. Our view is this is a much bigger bottom that has developed. If that’s the case, this pullback will be relatively shallow. It’s already pulling back from the 200-day. It’s sitting just above the 50-day moving average.\nSo, between the $8,800 and $8,200 – and I know it’s a big range – but that’s where we will see support and we think Bitcoin continues higher from here.”\nRegulatory risk is the fundamental issue driving the downward pressure on cryptocurrencies, but Sluymer is confident that the market has bottomed.\nHe is of the opinion that it is in a stage of general recovery and that the Blockchain Week will be the next big catalyst for Bitcoin.\nFundstrat’s Global Advisory forecast is based on three data points, the past events in 2015, 2016, and 2017. All of the previous conferences were followed by a bullish response from the cryptocurrency market.\nThe week-long event includes high-profile names such as St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, European Parliament member Eva Kaili, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, among other movers and shakers in the cryptocurrency world.\nThe organization expects to host approximately 8,000 people, half of whom are coming from abroad. Last year’s event had a turnout of 2,700 attendees, which shows how much the blockchain community has grown in size and importance in a single year.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Entries will lock 24 hours before 12pm Mondays so that we dont have every man and their fish entering at the last minute. (Yeah, were on to you Steve.)\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS:\nBoost Juice Pty Ltd ABN 11 092 165 681, Level 1, Tower 2 Chadstone Place, 1341 Dandenong Road, Chadstone, VIC 3148, Australia.

Entrants under the age of 18 must have parent or legal guardian approval to enter.\nHow to Enter:\nTo enter the Promotion, the entrant must complete all the steps in one of the following entry methods between the open and close times for a Week (as specified in the Winner Determination section below):\nEntry Method 1: How to Enter\na) purchase any size Boost Juice (smoothie, crush, juice) in one (1) transaction from any Boost store nationally. The entrant will receive a promo card with a unique code at the time of purchase, while stock lasts. The onus is on the entrant to request a promo card from store staff if not automatically provided; and\nb) download the Boost Juice app to their compatible device, open it and follow the instructions to enter the unique code. Once the unique code has been entered the entrant will be able to enter their prediction as to what the value (in Australian dollars) of bitcoin will be at 12pm AEDT the following Monday. The customer can choose to be randomly provided with a value that they can submit if they would prefer not to pick an exact number themselves. The number entered must be to two (2) decimal places.\nProof of purchase : The entrant must retain proof of purchase. The proof of purchase required is the promo card clearly showing the unique code used to enter.\nEntry Method 2: How to Enter 2\na) order a Boost Juice through the app to pick up in-store. The unique code will be provided automatically with purchases made through the app; and\nb) follow the instructions on the app to enter their prediction as to what the value (in Australian dollars) of bitcoin will be at 12pm AEDT the following Monday. The customer can choose to be randomly provided with a value that they can submit if they would prefer not to pick an exact number themselves. The number entered must be to two (2) decimal places.\nOnly one customer may predict each particular Bitcoin value for a given week. When a value has been selected this will be removed from the selection so other customers cannot predict the same value on that week. E.g. if someone predicts the value to be $18,500.00 nobody else can predict that same value for that particular week, but they would be able to enter a prediction of $18,500.01.\nEntries permitted:\nEntrants may enter multiple times provided each entry is submitted separately in accordance with the entry instructions above. Limit one (1) entry permitted per promo card. Limit one (1) entry permitted per transaction. The entrant is eligible to win a maximum of one (1) prize.

Valued at $20,875.30 (AUD) as at 10/01/18.\n4\nNo part of this prize is exchangeable, redeemable for cash or any other prize or transferable.\nWinner Determination:\nEntries open and close for each week on the dates/times specified below. The first entrant from each weeks entries who guesses the Correct Value for that week, will win the prize indicated below. The Correct Value is the exact Australian dollar value of bitcoin at 12pm (VIC time) the following Monday from the date of entry, as listed on the Coin Jar website ( https://www.coinjar.com.au/ ). If the Correct Value has not been predicted by an entrant, then the entrant who submits closest to the Correct Value, will be the winner for that week.\nHowever, if there are two (2) entrants that have both predicted closest to the Correct Value, with no one predicting the exact Correct Value, the lower value prediction will win (e.g. actual correct value is $10,003.42, no one guesses this, but 1 person guessed $10,003.41 and the other guessed $10,003.43, the entrant who guessed $10,003.41 will win for that week).\nWeek\nEntries Open\nEntries Close\nCorrect Value\n1\n19/02/18 at 09:00am AEDT\n25/02/18 at 12pm AEDT\n26/02/18 at 12pm AEDT\n2\n26/02/18 at 12:00am AEDT\n04/03/18 at 12pm AEDT\n05/03/18 at 12pm AEDT\n3\n05/03/18 at 12:00am AEDT\n11/03/18 at 12pm AEDT\n12/03/18 at 12pm AEDT\n4\n12/03/18 at 12:00am AEDT\n18/03/18 at 12pm AEDT\n19/03/18 at 12pm AEDT\nWinner notification:\nThe winners will be contacted by using the contact details on file with the Promoter.\nUnclaimed Prizes:\nIn the event of an unclaimed prize, the Promoter may at its discretion assign the prize to the entrant who would have been the winner had the original winner not participated in the Promotion, or withdraw the prize unawarded.

The value of the prizes is accurate and based upon the recommended retail value of the prizes (inclusive of GST) at the date of printing. The Promoter accepts no responsibility for any variation in the value of the prizes after that date.\n11. If a prize (or portion of a prize) is unavailable the Promoter substitute the prize (or that portion of the prize) to a prize of equal or greater value and/or specification.\n12.

If a winner is under the age of 18, a nominated parent or legal guardian of the winner will be required to sign the legal release on the winner's behalf.\n17. If a prize is provided to the Promoter by a third party, the prize is subject to the terms and conditions of the third party prize supplier and the provision of the prize is the sole responsibility of the third party and not the Promoter. The terms and conditions which apply to the prize at the time it is issued to the winner will prevail over these Conditions of Entry, to the extent of any inconsistency.

It was only the 2 nd positive day in the current week that has left Bitcoin down 12.2% Monday through Saturday. A continued slide from Friday saw Bitcoin fall to an intraday low and new swing lo $8,204.4 before a late morning recovery, Bitcoin managing to avoid the day’s first major support level at $8,158.17 and the risk of pulling back through to sub-$8,000 levels for the first time since 19 th April. Bitcoin’s late morning move through to an intraday high $8,631.7 fell short of the day’s first major resistance level at $8,842.47 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,730, with Bitcoin failing to touch $9,000 levels for the first time since 21 st April. The day’s new swing lo $8,204.4 continued to support the near-term bearish trend formed at 5 th May’s swing hi $9,999, with Bitcoin’s lacklustre gain on Saturday having little impact on the week’s losses. How the markets will respond to regulatory chatter through the week remains to be seen, but with the South Korean government continuing to send mixed messages to the market following the UpBit raid last week, there will be some concern over what lies ahead, particularly if the latest raid delivers some unwanted news on South Korea’s largest exchange adhering to KYC and anti-money laundering policies. It’s going to be a long summer, with regulators the world over expected to roll out regs and for Bitcoin, this week’s Bitcoin Cash hard fork will also be of influence, Bitcoin Cash looking to nudge Bitcoin off the top spot. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 1.15% to $8,373, with Saturday’s 0.84% gain having failed to inspire investors to jump back in. A start of the day $8,520.2 high fell short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628 and the day’s first major resistance level at $8,675.13, with hopes of a continuation to Saturday afternoon’s upward trend falling away as Bitcoin slipped to an early morning low $8,318.3 and back into the red. Holding above the day’s first major support level at $8,247.83 will have provided some hope of an afternoon recovery, though much will depend on the news wires and investor angst ahead of the new week, with the markets likely to get an update on the UpBit raid. A forced closure would certainly be damming for the markets and, while unlikely, remains a possibility nonetheless, which should continue to limit any material upside through today. For the day ahead, a move back through to $8,500 levels would support a run at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628, though without a material shift in market sentiment later in the morning, Bitcoin will likely leave the day’s second major resistance level at $8,867.07 untested to mark a second consecutive day that Bitcoin fails to break through to $9,000 levels. For now, the near-term bearish trend remains intact, with Bitcoin needing to break out from the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $8,890 through to $9,000 levels to reverse the near-term trend.

Banks can't see how much you have so you can buy a car with your bitcoins while if you pay in your currency the bank will call you.\nI take also payments in bitcoin because it is actually faster than my bank.

Dozens of TV shows have made references to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the years, though not always in a positive manner. It now seems a YouTuber known as Crypto Crow will be getting his own TV show on CBS, CW, and Roku starting next month. Crypto Crow on Television It is good to see major US TV broadcasters pay attention to cryptocurrency. All of the drama and controversy in the crypto industry often makes for some pretty good headlines, and even generates ideas for TV shows every now and then. Indeed, CBS’s New York affiliate will broadcast its very own show on cryptocurrency starting June 25. The show will be hosted by Jason Appleton. That name might not necessarily ring a bell for most people, as he is better known as Crypto Crow on YouTube. His videos have generated a lot of views over the past few months, mainly thanks to his ICO reviews and his successful investments in various currencies and tokens. Although a following of 70,000 YouTube subscribers doesn’t warrant getting a dedicated TV show on CBS New York, it seems the channel is more than interested in what Appleton brings to the table. He is a valuable influencer in the world of cryptocurrency, and the Crypto Crow brand has become increasingly popular over time. Through an agreement with CBS Television networks, 13 episodes of “Crypto Crow Show” will be aired in select markets. More specifically, the first season of this show will air in New York, Philly, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, and on Roku. In total, “Crypto Crow Show” will be broadcast to over 47 million homes. Just because this show can be watched in so many locations doesn’t mean it will ever get 47 million viewers per episode. However, it is an interesting experiment by CBS, to say the very least. The show itself will focus on many topics, ranging from ICOs to bot trading and cryptocurrency mining. This industry involves a lot of topics and aspects, all of which will need to be highlighted. Allowing people to gain a better understanding of how cryptocurrency works is vital for getting people excited about Bitcoin and altcoins. This is the first time a cryptocurrency YouTuber has launched their own TV show.

For Those Who HEDL The company’s first watch, called the CRYPTOMAT (i.e. Crypto-diplomat), was born during the early years when the first “Bitcoin embassies” started popping up around the world. It reflected the spirit of individuals representing the crypto movement all over the globe and who could deal with skeptics and naysayers in an effective way. “It was intended to be humorous, but the word stuck and became the name of our first collection,” says Cryptomatic’s watch designer, Luis Rosende, whose team has been in business for over a decade, helping a number of fashion and watch brands design and manufacture their collections. However, when the Cryptomat launched in 2014 , the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market entered a prolonged bearish cycle that lasted through 2016. “It was a real winter for Bitcoin, it truly tested people’s faith in the idea,” he explains. The belief didn’t die. Bitcoin came back stronger than ever as its price has skyrocketed in recent years while giving rise to a booming new industry in the process. Rosende adds: After that roller coaster of a ride, it was quite clear that the second collection should be dedicated to those patient souls who HEDL through the hard times, and so, the HODLER was born. A Timeless Design ‘Hodling’ is a term that has taken on a life of its own, evolving from a typo meme on an online forum to an entire subculture that believes in the long-term transformative power of Bitcoin technology. On the surface, the Cryptomatic watch is a stark contrast. It’s fully mechanical, based on old-world watch technology that doesn’t use any batteries, digital dials, or electronics. Upon a second look, however, its metal gears, springs, and jewel bearings made of ruby to reduce friction are a testament to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer design that eliminates the need to trust middlemen. The glass back reflects the transparency of its public ledger and proof-of-work backbone. Hand-assembled in Japan, the country of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the watch’s binary hour markers is another unique design element that pays homage to digital currency. And like Bitcoin, which remains the indisputable king of cryptocurrencies despite an ever-increasing amount of novel altcoins, Cryptomatic believes that mechanical watches are the only type of timepieces that are here to stay in the long run as Rosende states: Quartz watches didn’t kill mechanicals and smartwatches won’t either, you can quote us on that now and ten years from now. All the gadgety smartwatches will most likely stop being useful when the next technology cycle hits the market or when there’s no more support for firmware or replacement parts. The build does feel incredibly solid when wearing it on your wrist. The watch comes with a lifetime warranty, for which you can register by scanning the QR code printed on the individual customer card. It also comes with either steel or genuine leather strap options. (I personally prefer the black leather strap after trying both.) Staying Crypto Cryptomatic is a pretty unique company as it only takes payments in Bitcoin for their watches, which means no credit cards and no cash. The Holder collection watch currently costs around 0.09 BTC, or from $819 to $849 USD depending on the model. “About 98% of the watches have been sold for Bitcoin,” Rosende says. “The other ~ 2% are sales to clients who asked if they could pay in other cryptocurrencies, to which we have been mostly open.” To date, Cryptomatic has produced a limited number of editions numbering a few hundred watches per collection. The most popular and fastest selling model has been the Silver & Black HODLER , while the original Silver and Rose Gold CRYPTOMAT was the favorite from the first collection, says Rosende. He notes that Cryptomatic intends to remain a small and exclusive brand while continuing making small runs of high-quality, hand-assembled watch es but doesn’t rule out the addition of “smart” features in the future. So will we ever see a price ticker or a Bitcoin wallet integrated into a Cryptomatic? “One thing we can say is that our watches will always have a mechanical heart even if we decide to add ‘smart’ elements to them,” he says. The company does a lot of brainstorming when it comes to their designs, constantly thinking about new collections, though we probably won’t see a Litecoin-themed design in the near future. “What about putting in a moon rock if Bitcoin price breaks a new all-time high this year?” I asked Luis. “For now we will stick to Bitcoin as it is the origin of all cryptos,” Rosende says. “We’ll see what happens in the future. The moon rock idea is a really good idea by the way.” [Disclosure: Cryptomatic provided Bitcoinist with a free Cryptomatic watch for review purposes.] What do you think of the new Cryptomatic watch?

A look at CMC’s rankings shows only a couple of coins posting positive 24-hour price changes. However, in the midst of the general cratering, Bitcoin appears to be the least affected of the lot. South Korea: The Epicenter of Events UPbit , the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in South Korea, is currently under investigation. A joint task force of local police and financial regulators raided its Gangnam headquarters on May 10th. The platform is accused of diverting client funds into the wallets of its executives and forging its accounting records to cover up the malfeasance. The reaction from the crypto community to the news followed the established script – panic. At some point on May 11th, the top 25 cryptos, according to market capitalization, were all in the red. Prices were declining by as much as 16 percent for tokens like Stellar, EOS, and Cardano . According to Marius Rupsys , a digital currency investor: The main reason seems to be UPbit news. Most are talking about it, and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop. Crypto prices in South Korea are usually at a premium ( KimChi premium ) to the rest of the market. For the most of 2018, this premium was non-existent as the market recovered from a slow start to 2018. By the last week of April, market observers reported that the premiums were back . This return coincided with a considerable increase in average prices and total market capitalization values. As a result, any blip in the country’s local crypto market causes shockwaves in the global arena. However, some analysts believe that the present situation is an exaggerated reaction. According to Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of the crypto hedge fund firm, BitBull Capital: As is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The UPbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow a thicker skin. Bitcoin Resilience Bitcoin has so far suffered less of a decline than most other cryptos. The number one crypto fell below $9,000, but regarding percentage movement, its fall was much lower than the other top ten cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are attributing this to the stability of Bitcoin compared to other cryptos. Commenting on the stability of Bitcoin, Shone Antsey of Blockchain Intelligence Group said: BTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price. Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect. Bitcoin is the one to watch, since if it fails they all fail. Crypto enthusiasts expect Bitcoin to make a full recovery beginning from the upcoming Blockchain Week in New York. Is the market reaction to the UPbit saga exaggerated?

And, in a sense, they are. Blockchain technology is indeed important, but it seems largely incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, even though the web teems with attempts to explain it . This is partly because cryptography lies at its core, and since crypto involves complex mathematics it therefore lies beyond the ken of most people. But if one is prepared to take the maths as given, then really the basic idea is simple. As Don and Alex Tapscott put it in their book, Blockchain Revolution , a blockchain “is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value”. Until recently, the banking establishment was unremittingly hostile to cryptocurrencies. Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, for example, famously described bitcoin as a “fraud” . But recently, the wind seems to have changed. Last December, two big exchanges – the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets – launched bitcoin futures trading operations. This week Goldman Sachs announced that it would follow suit and is looking into the direct trading of bitcoin. And now – according to Wednesday’s Financial Times – even the New York Stock Exchange is “setting up an online platform for buying and holding bitcoin”. So what’s going on? To interpret it you need to understand that the cryptocurrency story has two interwoven strands: human greed on the one hand and utopian idealism on the other. It’s no accident that bitcoin emerged just after the 2008 banking crisis as people realised that we had been taken for an epic ride by the financial services industry. In a world where nobody – even the biggest banks – could be trusted, an unknown genius going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper arguing that cryptography could be harnessed to enable trustworthy transactions without having to rely on fallible or corrupt human institutions. A new digital currency – bitcoin – was the working example he proposed. And underpinning it was the cryptographic tool – the blockchain – which ensured that all transactions in the new currency could be validated without needing an institution to guarantee or underwrite them. Because the total number of bitcoins that can exist is limited by the design of the system to 21m, the currency was rapidly perceived as an asset or a store of value – like gold. Accordingly greed kicked in, triggering waves of speculative mania that are still continuing. And it is this speculative wave that Goldman Sachs and co now – belatedly – wish to surf. No surprise there, then. But implicit in the blockchain concept is an endearing strain of technocratic utopianism, a hope that technology can overcome some aspects of human frailty and corruption. The key to that lies in the latter half of the Tapscott definition quoted earlier – the idea that a blockchain can record “not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value” in a ledger that cannot be falsified. This is a really big idea, because well-governed societies depend on keeping certain kinds of documentation – birth and death certificates, title deeds, wills and so on – in ledgers that are both public and secure. In industrialised societies we have achieved this by having trustworthy institutions (registrars, solicitors, local authorities, etc), which have legal responsibilities and democratic oversight. But other societies are not so fortunate. In developing or authoritarian countries, for example, registries of land titles are critically vulnerable to tampering by corrupt officials. Using a blockchain to hold such titles could provide a way of ensuring that credible records endure, which is why countries such as the Republic of Georgia are beginning to do it . Story Continues None of this is easy to do, and there are lots of practical difficulties ahead. But in the greed and cynicism surrounding bitcoin and its peers, we shouldn’t lose sight of the great potential of blockchain technology. Many years ago, an engineer called Paul Baran had a Big Idea – that we could make a great communications network by using digital data packets rather than analogue phone lines. He was laughed out of court by AT&T. But it turned out that Baran’s idea was what gave us the internet. What I’m reading Gone – and forgotten Honestly! Kids these days! Opinion pollster YouGov did a survey to find out how much today’s schoolchildren know about the communications technologies of the past. They were shown 12 pictures of relevant objects from the past – typewriter, Nokia mobile phone, overhead projector, floppy disk, cassette, pager etc. Two-thirds didn’t know what a floppy disk was (though some recognised it as the icon for “Save”), 27% didn’t recognise a typewriter and 40% didn’t know what an audio cassette was. (On the other hand, analogue nostalgists can take comfort that only a quarter of the kids couldn’t recognise a record player. So vinyl may not be a lost cause with future generations. Biggest surprise: 23% didn’t recognise a postcard. Scandal you say? Facebook users inhabit an ethics-free zone. A Reuters survey has found that the Cambridge Analytica scandal has had no real impact on those who use the service. Three-quarters of US users say they’re using Facebook as much as or more than before the revelations. Take back control MIT researchers have built a tool that enables you to control what you see in your social media feeds.

Like, he really loves Bitcoin — so much so that he took the opportunity to once again share that love with the world on Thursday.\nThe American venture capitalist began by lauding Bitcoin's foundations to the hosts of CNBC 's \"Closing Bell,\" explaining :\nThere's a major revolution taking place that is now allowing for a better currency — one that is more secure, that is decentralized, that is more effective, more useful. It's global. It's open to everyone. It banks the unbanked. It allows people to send their money to their families in the Philippines or in Mexico without any big friction. It is a far better currency than the fiat currency.\n'No One has Ever Hacked the Bitcoin Blockchain' Draper's preference for the gold-standard of cryptocurrency over fiat currency is one shared by many Bitcoin proponents around the world — but not everyone agrees, of course. Plenty of skeptics still prefer government-issued fiat currencies and the traditional banking infrastructure. Draper, however, finds that silly, explaining:\nRight now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money and the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away but they're getting hacked all the time. No one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. So as a store of value it is a great place to be.\nWhile that may sound foolish to the uninitiated or skeptical investor, consider the state of fiat currencies in countries with collapsing economies . Noted Draper:\nIf you're in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you're not going to lose your fortune.\n'Unfettered by Political Whims' Finally, Draper told the CNBC crew that Bitcoin isn't merely a fad. Rather, it's \"the future of the world.\" He explained:\nThere are many many reasons [and] many many uses. […] This is going to be a major change in the future of the world. It's a major breakthrough and I can't wait for us to be sort of one world with our currencies as opposed to having it tied to some political influence or another, or some government just decides to inflate or decides that they're just going to take a bunch of currency. This is a great opportunity for the people to run their businesses unfettered by political whims.\nIn our case, Draper is just preaching to the choir.\nWhat do you think of Draper's recent statements in regards to Bitcoin? Do you think the most popular cryptocurrency is a better store of value than fiat?

This will, in my opinion, either make or break the QAnon followers to “keep” their disingenuous threads of conversation at bay … If I should see any improvement to keep topics of conversation focused on events and not sway into the totally guess works, then I may or may not pull them into my own postings.

Are you saved? Do you know Jesus Christ as your Lord & Savior? “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.” {John 15:5 NKJV} Pray to the One who saves man’s soul from eternal darkness separated from the giver of Life, Jesus Christ.

Like, he really loves Bitcoin — so much so that he took the opportunity to once again share that love with the world on Thursday.\nThe American venture capitalist began by lauding Bitcoin’s foundations to the hosts of CNBC ‘s “Closing Bell,” explaining :\nThere’s a major revolution taking place that is now allowing for a better currency — one that is more secure, that is decentralized, that is more effective, more useful. It’s global. It’s open to everyone. It banks the unbanked. It allows people to send their money to their families in the Philippines or in Mexico without any big friction. It is a far better currency than the fiat currency. ‘No One has Ever Hacked the Bitcoin Blockchain’\nDraper’s preference for the gold-standard of cryptocurrency over fiat currency is one shared by many Bitcoin proponents around the world — but not everyone agrees, of course. Plenty of skeptics still prefer government-issued fiat currencies and the traditional banking infrastructure. Draper, however, finds that silly, explaining:\nRight now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money and the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away but they’re getting hacked all the time. No one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. So as a store of value it is a great place to be.\nWhile that may sound foolish to the uninitiated or skeptical investor, consider the state of fiat currencies in countries with collapsing economies . Noted Draper:\nIf you’re in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.\n‘Unfettered by Political Whims’\nFinally, Draper told the CNBC crew that Bitcoin isn’t merely a fad. Rather, it’s “the future of the world.” He explained:\nThere are many many reasons [and] many many uses. […] This is going to be a major change in the future of the world. It’s a major breakthrough and I can’t wait for us to be sort of one world with our currencies as opposed to having it tied to some political influence or another, or some government just decides to inflate or decides that they’re just going to take a bunch of currency. This is a great opportunity for the people to run their businesses unfettered by political whims.\nIn our case, Draper is just preaching to the choir.\nWhat do you think of Draper’s recent statements in regards to Bitcoin? Do you think the most popular cryptocurrency is a better store of value than fiat?

Bitcoin is freely used for anyone. anywhere\nWhat is your response with this opinion?\nYes, I agree. Anyone can use Bitcoin as long as the user have an internet access and a gadget to start with. Anyone who use Bitcoin is anonymous. The only difference is rich people can easily start with a Bitcoin than the poor , you must have money to do that.\nWith this fact should all countries immediately legalize bitcoin so bitcoin could be more useful to improve the economy globally, I'm sure that if bitcoin is legalized then poverty will decrease drastically.\nWith its decentralized in nature, it warmly welcomes willing participants as long as they are functional and are able to deliver then they can be part of Bitcoin team. No matter what your societal status is and personal background it does not discriminate. It respects privacy and security is its topmost priority. Be committed, be goal-oriented, do research, study and execute, keep hope and positivity strong, and be patient.\nPrecisely! What is important is the passion you have to be part of bitcoin and being able to perform the role. There is no stereotyping in Bitcoin family, and nobody is prohibited to join as long as you have the courage to take the risks and the strong determination to succeed. It does not matter if what's your gender or race for you to qualify, it's about having proper decorum and professionalism to deal from any troubles in Bitcoin in terms of price, market and more. Right attitude, positive response, and willingness to learn are still of high regards in the field of Bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T04:52:22.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "947bb44ec111dce2037430ef4db57b4e99e72ea6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWY9Ejf_WMqf1fMDJ.bBeak-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why you can be interested in bitcoin ?", "title_full": "Why you can be interested in bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-05-13T07:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "947bb44ec111dce2037430ef4db57b4e99e72ea6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWY9Ejf_WMqf1fMDJ.bBeak-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Baimovic", "published": "2018-05-13T07:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why you can be interested in bitcoin ?", "text": "there are many ways to get bitcoin, and every way has a risk, trading has a huge advantage but the risk is also very big, you can die in the trading arena.\ninvestment is very easy, you just have to buy bitcoin then store in the wallet for a long time until bitcoin prices rise and to the moon. and the risk is hacking. you should be ready if you lose your bitcoin in the wallet.\nor you can also follow the campaign in this forum, then after you get the coin, you can convert it to bitcoin. but that's not easy, because forums have rules.\nI'm interested in bitcoin, because bitcoin can provide a promising income, and already many people prove it, bitcoin is not a scam and bitcoin is not Ponzi either.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T05:22:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "def3ae5502c3456a87ce0f5d91ccd49ce8119d8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywQOzX2bzhWxERFIheKXUFsWVXmggKhhiwm5C_fiOHjh8BbywNGOD5pA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis – BCH/USD Upsides Remain Capped", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis – BCH/USD Upsides Remain Capped", "published": "2018-05-13T07:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "def3ae5502c3456a87ce0f5d91ccd49ce8119d8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywQOzX2bzhWxERFIheKXUFsWVXmggKhhiwm5C_fiOHjh8BbywNGOD5pA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T07:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis – BCH/USD Upsides Remain Capped", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price found support around the $1,275 level after a major decline against the US Dollar.

The pair may continue to find sellers on the upside near the $1,480 and $1,500 levels in the near term. Bitcoin cash price declined towards $1,250 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is correcting higher, but upsides remain capped by the $1,500 level.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance This past week, bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its gains and declined from the $1,700 level against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and moved below the $1,500 and $1,300 support levels. It traded close to the $1,250 support and a low was formed at $1,276. At the moment, the price is correcting higher and is trading above the $1,350 level.\nIt also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,677 high to $1,276 low. However, the price is facing a lot of sellers around the $1,475 level. It also represents a crucial pivot zone, acting as a barrier for buyers near $1,500. It was a support earlier and is now preventing gains above $1,500. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,677 high to $1,276 low is also around $1,475.

Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost. \"Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,\" Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin's fashionable neighbourhood Prenzlauer Berg. \"With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via Internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\" Clients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the cryptocurrencies' fluctuating exchange rates. Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. Albrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month. Most clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed $50,000. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. Adoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the US, according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.

for a wise trader, it's normal trend with bitcoin now pump and dump. If you see this volatility as a good opoortunity to make profit then you can surely have that profit.

With just days left there are a few things BCH holders and full node operators should know before the upgrade takes place this coming Tuesday. Also read: Japan’s GMO Has Mined Over 900 Bitcoins – Hashrate Doubled Last Month Just a Few Days Left Until the May 15th Bitcoin Cash Upgrade The Bitcoin Cash network is about to perform the largest block size increase ever as the upgrade will expand the block size by 4X on May 15, 2018. The development team has also added ‘Satoshi OP_Codes,’ and the fork will also increase the protocol’s default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes. Unless you run a BCH full node implementation there is not much a common user needs to do. The Hard Fork Activation Will Use the Median Time Past Method The BCH fork on May 15 will be similar to the fork activations that took place on August 1, and the DAA fork that took place this past November. This means the activation will take place on May 15, but there won’t be specific block height, because the upgrade will activate based on ‘Median Time Past’ (MTP). The initiation of the hard fork will begin on Tuesday, May 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade will not be implemented until the MTP timestamp and the processing of 11 blocks equal to or greater than 1,526,400,000 takes place. Following this period after the next block, the 32MB upgrade will be live on the BCH network. Full Node Clients and Miners Must Update Software Full node operators need to upgrade their Bitcoin Cash clients as soon as possible, before the fork begins. ABC users can download the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version here , and those operating other full nodes like Bitcoin Unlimited, or XT should upgrade to the client that supports the 32MB increase. At the moment looking at data for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a great majority of nodes have already upgraded to the latest 0.17.1 ABC version. Full node operators and miners are required to upgrade their software in order to participate during and after the network change. May 15th Fork Will Change the Protocol’s base block size to 32 MB It’s always a good measure to look out for any updates provided by your exchange or wallet provider to make sure the platform you use is ready to accept the network changes. If your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s probably safe to assume that the exchange or wallet provider is ready for the upgrade, but make sure to check the app provider’s blog or info pages. Last Fork Took Place This November The May 15th Bitcoin Cash fork that will change the protocol’s base block size to 32 MB, while adding some other interesting features will be quite a milestone for the BCH community. The last fork that took place this November was successful , and the new Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has worked flawlessly ever since. The 32MB increase will be much larger than the already sizable 8MB blocks, and the upgrade will likely be a historic day for public blockchain consensus upgrades. https://news.bitcoin.com/upgrade-time-bitcoin-cash-32mb-fork-activates-tuesday/?utm_source=OneSignal%20Push&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=Push%20Notifications ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi op_codes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T07:06:25.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c24c792fb25412066f6434b65f5a56a0ea836567", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXIKNdCU1RIb_PB4cLIBnhM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best investment is bitcoin", "title_full": "Best investment is bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T06:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c24c792fb25412066f6434b65f5a56a0ea836567", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXIKNdCU1RIb_PB4cLIBnhM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jack8989", "published": "2018-05-13T06:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best investment is bitcoin", "text": "I think we can't consider Bitcoin as the best investment at all because the best investment is depending on how you're working with it.

Albrecht explained to Reuters TV :\nTraditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nWhat makes this service even more remarkable is the fact that Bitbond became an officially licensed bank in 2016.\nHow it Works Bitbond works by letting clients hold their loans in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for extremely short periods of time before they are exchanged back into the receiving countries' native fiat currency. This method keeps exchange rates relatively fixed and prevents the cryptocurrency market's infamous volatility from undermining the process.\nAs noted by Reuters , this isn't the first time Bitcoin has been used as loan collateral. However, Bitbond is reportedly the first to offer the transfer of credit in currency internationally. As such, the company has become increasingly popular since it originally launched in 2013 — currently managing 100 clients' loans for a rough total of $1 million each month.\nThe majority of said clients, Albrecht told Reuters , are small business owners or freelance workers, while the loans are less than $50,000 each.\nGermany Loves Bitcoin As a side note, Germans have been particularly keen on adopting Bitcoin. According to Bitnodes, Germany has the second most Bitcoin nodes in the world — behind only the U.S.\nHowever, authorities in the European country haven't historically been too keen on cryptocurrency. In February, interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier signed a letter to fellow G20 finance ministers, in which he claimed cryptocurrencies are not only risky for investors but also threaten long-term global financial stability.\nNevertheless, Germany did join 21 of its European neighbors in signing a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership on April 10.\nWhat do you think about a certified online bank subverting SWIFT by sending loans internationally with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?
