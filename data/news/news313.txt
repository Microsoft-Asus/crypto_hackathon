Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP and Bloomberg will establish the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). The index service will provide trusted asset tracking for 10 of the most liquid cryptocurrencies in the market. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index\nThe BGCI is part of the Bloomberg Index Services Limited catalog and is administered by the company. The platform offers institutional-grade benchmarking standards for cryptocurrencies.\nSpeaking on the launch, Alan Campbell, the Bloomberg Indices Global Product Manager, said:\nToday’s launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index reflects our clients’ growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market. How the Index Works\nThe BGCI will monitor and track the performance of the ten largest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap. The index operates via a rules-based methodology. To ensure accuracy, all data used by the index must pass the due-diligence framework set by both Bloomberg and Galaxy Digital.\nNot all cryptocurrencies are the same. As a result, the BGCI’s cryptocurrency tracking pool covers the different classes of digital coins. These classes are privacy assets, mediums of exchange, stores of value, and smart contract tokens. The ten cryptos contained in the BGCI paradigm at its launch are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple , Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Zcash.\nThe maximum and minimum cap for any coin on the index is 30 percent and 1 percent respectively. At inception, both Bitcoin and Ethereum make up 30 percent of the BGCI while Zcash is at one percent. Commenting on the way the BCGI is structured, Steve Kurz, Asset Management Chief at Galaxy Digital, said:\nWe are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index’s independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature. The BGCI will Become the S&P 500 for Cryptos\nMike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism at the new BGCI. He described the index as another milestone in the march towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. He also said the platform adopts the rigorous approach utilized by mainstream benchmarking services to the crypto market.\nCommenting on the potential importance of the BGCI, Novogratz said:\nWe wanted an institutional player for the whole ecosystem, and I think it’s important for the crypto ecosystem. You’re starting to see more institutional participation, and what they’re looking for is this architecture — here’s an index that will feel like the S&P 500 in a few months, that people can benchmark themselves against.\nBloomberg and Galaxy Digital aren’t the first to launch a crypto benchmarking platform. Upbit, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, recently created a cryptocurrency index service.\nDo you think the BGCI will become the de facto crypto benchmarking service for mainstream investors?

But Benjamin Lau, the chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors, says Nvidia has another opportunity that's much bigger than crypto mining. Booming demand for Nvidia's chips for artificial intelligence and data centers should drive the company's business for the near future, he said. &\nGraphics chipmaker Nvidia pulled the curtain back on its bitcoin mining-related business for the first time on Thursday. But the real game-changing opportunity for Nvidia is not inside the crowded cryptocurrency mines — it's in the wide open field of artificial intelligence.\nSo says Benjamin Lau, the& chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors, a firm with $650 million under management that's betting big on Nvidia.&\nNvidia's business designing chips for AI uses, which could upend industries from healthcare to transportation, and chips for computer data centers are the future, said Lau.\n\"They have a great platform and not a lot of really meaningful competition in that space,\" said Lau, whose firm is long Nvidia's stock.\nNvidia is already seeing significant success in those areas. In the first quarter , its data center business brought in $701 million in revenue, which was up 71% from the year-ago period. Sales of its latest Tesla chips — which the company designed for AI processing — helped boost the data center business, the company said.\nData center sales were reportedly below analysts' estimates, which may have explained the sell-off in Nvidia's stock in after-hours trading following its report. In recent trading, Nvidia's shares were down $8.53, or 3%, to $251.60.\nStill, Lau was impressed with the business' performance in the period and sees it continuing to drive Nvidia's overall results.\"The AI stuff and the data center stuff is going to be the short-term boost\" for Nvidia, Lau said.\nThe investor is also optimistic about the company's automotive efforts, although those have been mired in controversy of late. Nvidia has been developing chips and other technology for use in self-driving cars.\nAfter an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian in Arizona , Nvidia announced that it would suspend its own autonomous vehicle tests . Uber's self-driving cars use Nvidia graphics processors, but not its autonomous vehicle system .\nThe bitcoin business is in the past, the autonomous car business is the future Nvidia's automotive business totaled $145 million in sales in the first quarter, up just 4% from the year-ago period.\nBut it's still early days in the development of self-driving cars, Lau said.\n\"The auto stuff is going to be the future for them,\" he said. But he acknowledged that \"there will be speed bumps with autonomous driving.\"\nOne area Lau isn't counting much on is cryptocurrency mining. For the first time ever, Nvidia disclosed in its earnings report its cryptocurrency-related sales, saying they hit $289 million in its first quarter.\nNvidia and rival AMD have been boosted in recent years by the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. So-called miners have bought up their graphics processors to help solve the complex mathematical problems involved in creating new cybercoins.\nBut that business appears to be waning as prices of bitcoin and other cybercurrencies have slumped, the cost involved in mining them have risen, and as miners rely increasingly on application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICS, which are chips designed for particular purposes. Nvidia itself predicted sales would slump in its second quarter, something that jibes with Lau's expectations.\n\"It's not going to be a driver going forward,\" he said. \"It was a nice boost while they had it.\"\nNvidia's stock has soared over the last two years amid burgeoning sales and earnings.

"Billionaire Bitcoin Bull Partners with Bloomberg to Launch Cryptocurrency Index Platform May 10, 2018 154\nBitcoin proponent and former Goldman Sachs trader Mike Novogratz has inked a partnership deal with Bloomberg to launch a cryptocurrency index platform. Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP and Bloomberg will establish the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). The index service will provide trusted asset tracking for 10 of the most liquid cryptocurrencies in the market. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index\nThe BGCI is part of the Bloomberg Index Services Limited catalog and is administered by the company. The platform offers institutional-grade benchmarking standards for cryptocurrencies.\nSpeaking on the launch, Alan Campbell, the Bloomberg Indices Global Product Manager, said:\nToday’s launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index reflects our clients’ growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market. How the Index Works\nThe BGCI will monitor and track the performance of the ten largest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap. The index operates via a rules-based methodology. To ensure accuracy, all data used by the index must pass the due-diligence framework set by both Bloomberg and Galaxy Digital.\nNot all cryptocurrencies are the same. As a result, the BGCI’s cryptocurrency tracking pool covers the different classes of digital coins. These classes are privacy assets, mediums of exchange, stores of value, and smart contract tokens. The ten cryptos contained in the BGCI paradigm at its launch are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple , Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Zcash.\nThe maximum and minimum cap for any coin on the index is 30 percent and 1 percent respectively. At inception, both Bitcoin and Ethereum make up 30 percent of the BGCI while Zcash is at one percent. Commenting on the way the BCGI is structured, Steve Kurz, Asset Management Chief at Galaxy Digital, said:\nWe are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index’s independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature. The BGCI will Become the S&P 500 for Cryptos\nMike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism at the new BGCI. He described the index as another milestone in the march towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. He also said the platform adopts the rigorous approach utilized by mainstream benchmarking services to the crypto market.\nCommenting on the potential importance of the BGCI, Novogratz said:\nWe wanted an institutional player for the whole ecosystem, and I think it’s important for the crypto ecosystem. You’re starting to see more institutional participation, and what they’re looking for is this architecture — here’s an index that will feel like the S&P 500 in a few months, that people can benchmark themselves against.\nBloomberg and Galaxy Digital aren’t the first to launch a crypto benchmarking platform. Upbit, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, recently created a cryptocurrency index service.\nDo you think the BGCI will become the de facto crypto benchmarking service for mainstream investors?

According to them, the theft will exist with the continuous existence of Bitcoin is also its biggest Nemesis still. To ensure maximum security for your valuable assets, you have decided for Xapo because of its holistic complexity – caution is better than indulgence. As Bitcoin is stored\nTo store the easiest and probably safest way is Bitcoin, in which it writes the private key on a piece of paper and then hidden. Private keys are practically like the password to your Bank account – if thieves have the private key, then you can transfer all your possessions in a matter of seconds.\nIn view of this, most investors tend to keep their private key in “Cold Storage” (Offline storage) – Offline device such as a USB Stick. Hackers, however, are more intelligent because they are able to develop Trojan horses that can attack the device Offline, as soon as it is online – for example, if you connect it to a Computer.\nTo prevent this, bury Xapo storage of the private key contains deep in the earth, with electronic safeguards to prevent people from hacking with EMPs or other methods in the devices.\nWith Bitcoin, worth about 10 billion US dollars Xapo stores currently, about 7 percent of the world’s Bitcoin supply.

Twitter by Tom Metcalf Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers – connected to nothing – that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he's the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $US10 billion ($13 billion) of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin's price, after all, is hardly steady.\nXapo offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it. 'Patient Zero' Advertisement Related Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full Quote: ASX Announcements Expand View all announcements Even in the colourful world of crypto the cache is remarkable – amounting to about 7 per cent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just four years old, has more \"deposits\" than 98 per cent of the roughly 5670 banks in the US. But as a custodian it's regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves US customers through a Delaware corporation that's registered with the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares – a serial entrepreneur nicknamed \"Patient Zero\" for stirring Silicon Valley's interest in Bitcoin – has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n\"Everyone who isn't keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,\" said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $US500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. \"You couldn't pay me to keep it with a bank.\"\nXapo's billionaire backers include LinkedIn, co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who's in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nXapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares' belief that of all the cyber currencies it is the only one that will succeed. The first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key – the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar .\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they're online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defence.\nTrading desk Xapo's solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n\"They're the first folks who recognised custodial and security functions would be key,\" said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $US20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. \"He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.\"\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client's identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorised. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo's launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelising of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he had spoken to Casares. Xapo's advisers now include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , ex-Citigroup chief executive officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo's success. First Block Capital, Canada's first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n\"Every part of their DNA is geared to security,\" said Sean Clark, First Block's founder, who noted the vault's fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. \"Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it's big enough they'll fly out to see us.\"\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with president Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nTidal wave The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says it is already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n\"A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,\" Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life's mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina's remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech start-ups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $US529 million in 2000 and digital wallet start-up Lemon for $US43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n\"I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,\" Casares told Lemon board member Eric O'Brien, according to Digital Gold , a book by Nathaniel Popper.

poison” five years ago when the digital currency was trading just above $100 and now refers to it as “more expensive rat poison.”\n“I like it when my country steps hard on idiot booms instead of fanning the flame,” Munger said during an interview on “Countdown to the Closing Bell.” “If there’s ever anything that needed stepping down on hard, it’s bitcoin.”\nMunger said investors who are bullish on cryptocurrency are fueling economic consequences that harm the U.S.\n“To me, it’s just dementia,”Munger said Saturday during Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “It’s like somebody else is trading turds, and you decide you can’t be left out.”\nMunger was also interviewed on CNBC on Monday , and again he talked about Bitcoin, but his time in light of gold:\nAnd that is really a telling statement if you think about it.\nThe MSM must never allow anything positive to be said about gold, but they just let this little nugget slip by their filters.\nProbably because “worthless” and “artificial” and immediately preceded the word “gold”, and, as such, the title and posting got auto-approved as an anti-gold hit piece.\nBut let it sink in

This shouldn't take more than two minutes. (Related reading, see: Basics For Buying And Investing In Bitcoin )\n[ Setting up a Bitcoin wallet is only the first step in becoming a cryptocurrency trader. If you're interested in learning more, Investopedia's Crypto Trading Course provides a comprehensive overview of the subject. You'll learn everything from crypto basics - including how to setup wallets - to technical analysis and risk management techniques to enhance your profitability. ]\nThis is what your account page would look like if you were to sign up for a Bitcoin wallet on Coinbase. As you see, it looks kind of like the online banking software that most traditional commercial banks use for their customers: Use Regular Money to Buy Bitcoin\nOnce you have a Bitcoin wallet, you use a traditional payment method such as credit card, bank transfer (ACH), or debit card to buy Bitcoins on a Bitcoin exchange (example: Coinbase ). The Bitcoins are then transferred to your wallet. The availability of the above payment methods is subject to the area of jurisdiction and exchange chosen. Here is a screenshot of the Bitcoin interface showing how to buy and sell not just Bitcoin but also Bitcoin Cash , Ethereum and Litecoin ​, which are other popular virtual currencies. As you see, it's as straightforward as clicking on the \"Buy\" tab if you want to buy, and \"Sell\" tab if you want to sell. You select which currency you are buying/selling and which payment method (your bank account or credit card) you want to use.\nRemember that \"Bitcoin exchange\" and \"Bitcoin wallet\" need not be the same. Bitcoin exchanges are kind of like forex exchanges – places where you can trade Bitcoin for a fiat currency, say, BTC for USD and vice versa (in U.S. for example). While exchanges offer wallet capabilities to users, it’s not their primary business. Since wallets need to be kept safe and secure, exchanges do not encourage storing of Bitcoins for higher amounts or long periods of time. Hence, it is best to transfer your Bitcoins to a secure wallet. Security must be your top priority while opting for a Bitcoin wallet; always opt for the one with multi-signature facility.\nThere are many well-established exchanges that act as a one-stop solution by offering high security standards and reporting. Due diligence must be exercised while choosing a Bitcoin exchange or wallet. (Related reading, see: What Is Cold Storage For Bitcoin ) A Bitcoin Wallet is for Your Private Key, Not for Storing Bitcoin\nThe common assumption that Bitcoins are stored in a wallet is technically incorrect. Bitcoins are not stored anywhere. Bitcoin balances are kept using public and private “keys,” which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm that was used to create them. The public key (comparable to a bank account number or IBAN) serves as the address published to the world, and to which others may send Bitcoins.\nThe private key (comparable to an ATM PIN) is meant to be a guarded secret, and only used to authorize Bitcoin transmissions. Thus, it’s the “private key” that is kept in a Bitcoin wallet. Some safeguards for a Bitcoin wallet include: encrypting the wallet with a strong password and choosing the cold storage option, i.e. storing it offline. In the case of Coinbase, they offer a secure \"multisig vault\" to host your keys, which you can sign up for.\nAs a user, you are free to use those Bitcoins using the “private key” to buy a commodity, or make a payment for a service, or send money to a friend or family. These Bitcoins are sent using the “address” of the recipient. Selling Bitcoins on the exchange will earn you its selling amount in the local currency, which can be withdrawn by you.\nAlthough Bitcoin is homogenous (the same everywhere in the world), its price varies across countries and even exchanges within the same country, giving a rise to arbitrage opportunities. At one point in 2017, the Bitcoin price in South Korea was trading at a 35% premium and in India, a 20-25% premium. The demand and supply conditions result in some aberrations in its price.\nThe number of places where Bitcoins can be spent is increasing rapidly and includes some big retail players as well as many small businesses and retailers. The increased acceptance is boosting its footprint across the globe and is helping it secure an official recognition as a mode of payment. Japan has recently accepted Bitcoin as a payment mode. The Bottom Line\nThe changing regulatory stance, increasing adoption and acceptance, investments in Bitcoin start-ups and products being launched around it have cumulatively raised the confidence in Bitcoin. However, it’s still in a nascent stage and thus one must be aware of the price volatility issues, taxation aspect and legality angle before buying Bitcoins.

As the number of people willing to acquire it increases, the value increases proportionally, although the roots of this desire are often emotional-psychological, and that is why it is difficult to find an objective value to things, as is the case with bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:06:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb5fd8a03e59560a1495b543964e8bc9cb2c2b1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFlCAKY6RhB1NQVf.PJI7E80X6GGWq_rbNRYtmPLFWZZ4lFRPG0sUG9TEbk6sb7g7pg--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "How Bitcoin Is Volatile? – Motley Fool", "title_full": "How Bitcoin Is Volatile? – Motley Fool", "published": "2018-05-10T19:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-Bitcoin-Is-Volatile-8211-Motley-Fool.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb5fd8a03e59560a1495b543964e8bc9cb2c2b1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFlCAKY6RhB1NQVf.PJI7E80X6GGWq_rbNRYtmPLFWZZ4lFRPG0sUG9TEbk6sb7g7pg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T19:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Bitcoin Is Volatile? – Motley Fool", "text": " How Bitcoin Is Volatile? – Motley Fool\nBetween March 2010 and mid-December 2017, bitcoin rallied from less than $0.01 to more than $20,000 per token. But for as good as bitcoin has been for long-term investors, it has also weighed heavily on their nerves and tried their patience. In this instance, the lower the percentage, the less volatile an asset is relative to the U.S. dollar. In other words, bitcoin is many, many times more volatile than traditional assets, and it is certainly not for those with weak stomachs.

In addition to a lightning fast transaction speed, which has been Dash’s main attraction, the cryptocurrency also boasts several noteworthy features, including user anonymity. This article explores some of the competitive advantages of Dash over Bitcoin.\nDash (DASH) Vs Bitcoin: Which One Is Better?\nA little insight into the price trend will reveal that this year has been really critical for Bitcoin and its likes. Apart from the downtrend, which distressed many investors, the currency has seen some major challenges in the recent time. Speaking of Bitcoin’s limitations, mention must be made of its terribly slow transaction speed. The following points illustrate why Dash is a viable alternative to Bitcoin. Dash Is Faster Than Bitcoin :\nThe major drawback of Bitcoin at the moment is its notoriously slow transaction speed. In the highly competitive world of cryptocurrency, speed plays a pivotal role in trading. This is why the market has seen the surge of numerous new currencies that boast lightning fast transaction. As most investors would agree, Bitcoin’s slow transaction speed is a huge big turn-off, especially in today’s volatile market where investors need to make quick decisions. Dash, which offers its users an additional facility known as InstasSend, allows investors to execute their transaction within minutes. Dash Is Less Expensive Than Bitcoin:\nBitcoin’s value has gone down this year but, as the largest currency in the market, it is an expensive option. Also, it’s quite risky to invest in Bitcoin, as the Bitcoin market is quite volatile at the moment. At any rate, Dash (DASH), which is presently trading at $448.58, is a lucrative option for investors looking for a cheaper alternative. Dash Is Nourished by an Active Community:\nAlthough Bitcoin has a huge follower-base, the community is at war. In the past couple of months, Bitcoin has seen some nasty forks. As you are aware of, the cryptocurrency has been divided into many new currencies, including BitcoinPrivate, BitcoinCash, and Bitcoin Gold. Quite naturally, the community has divided into subgroups, each supporting different forks. Speaking of Bitcoin forks, many investors blame these forks for the price volatility of Bitcoin. In contrast, Dash is supported by a highly functional community. Like any other currency, Dash’s community also faces critical arguments, but the efficient administrative structure enables it to offer solutions for all investment-related challenges. Dash’s Privacy Features Will Put Bitcoin to Shame:\nAs opposed to Bitcoin and other big names, which are criticised for security breaches, Dash provides users with a special security feature, wherein users can expect anonymous transactions. Dash’s privacy feature is not a default option and can be accessed on request. The best part PrivateSend, the optional security feature, is its anonymity; it is impossible to trace transactions to real-life identities.\nIn addition to the aforementioned facilities, Dash has developed an excellent interface which enables users to procure DASH tokens offline. While such a possibility is unimaginable with most of the currencies, Dash has managed to make a breakthrough, allowing users to carry out offline transactions.\nDash’s Price Forecast for 2018\nJust like the majority of cryptocurrencies, Dash’s performance hasn’t been stable, as the first quarter of 2018 has seen a steady decline of Dash’s value. However, as per the recent price records, the price is gaining momentum in the market. Considering the critical condition of the market, making a comeback can be terribly difficult. With some major currencies trading in the trading, Dash’s positive price movement surprised the investors.\nThe currency, which ranks 13 by market capitalization, is available to the traders at $448.58. Much to the investors’ delight, the currency has gained 6.04% from its earlier position, featuring it among the top gainers this week. With a market capitalization of $3,616,656,589, the cryptocurrency boasts a trading volume of $90,771,900 at the time of writing.\nDoes the price spike signal a bull run for Dash ?\nThe cryptocurrency, which has plunged steeply from its record high of $1,515.39 on December 20, 2017, is making slow advancements. While analysts interpret the spike as a sign of revival, it’s difficult to say what will happen with this promising cryptocurrency. If the market analysts are right, the price might just hit its record high, the $1500 price level.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

New research from Fundstrat Global Advisors places Bitcoin prices at $36,000 by the end of 2019, co-founder Tom Lee revealed Thursday, May 10.\nAnalysis of the relationship between Bitcoin mining costs and price by Fundstrat’s Quantamental Strategist Sam Doctor has led the market research firm to predict the cryptocurrency’s range will fall between $20,000 and $64,000 by 2019 year end.\nThe calculations focused on Bitcoin Price to Mining Breakeven Cost Metric, known as P/BE, which Doctor says has “proven a reliable long-term support level.”\n“We expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple,” an executive summary of the findings uploaded to Twitter by cofounder Tom Lee reads.

It’s not value itself. It’s a verb.\nGold was once considered money because it was a good intermediary. It was rare and portable. It was attractive and easily understood by most people. But if Aladdin emerged from a nearby cave with tons of gold, the value of gold would plunge. Gold is, in the end, a commodity.\nSo far in 2018, the price of gold has held up better than the price of stocks but most analysts understand its value is tied to its use as a commodity , not a currency.\nDespite this, you may be reading that many investors are now buying Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) tied to gold, worried about the international situation.\nThey’re also buying bitcoin. Gold Doesn’t Hold Up\nDuring the last five years the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ) is down about 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 60%. GLD has not felt the market wobble that began in late January, and since January 26 is only down 3% against a Dow drop of 7%.\nOf course, you can plot out graphs across any distance in time to prove almost anything. Consider the value of GLD over the last three years, compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC ), a mutual fund tied to bitcoin. They’re all within 1% of each other, and within 1% of even as well, although GBTC is far more volatile.\nGold does have advantages as a store of value. New supplies can be estimated accurately, as can demand for jewelry and electronics. It is fungible, and can be exchanged for any currency, or bartered directly for goods.\nBitcoin has many of these advantages. The total number of answers to the bitcoin puzzle is limited. Given that it exists only in a computer, it is highly transportable, and can be exchanged for any currency. It can also be bartered for goods.\nBut that doesn’t make bitcoin money. That makes bitcoin a commodity, one with a total market cap of $159 billion as of May 10. The world’s gold supply is worth over $7 trillion. What Makes Gold Useful\nWhat makes gold useful today is that $7 trillion market size, which is half the market cap of the NASDAQ. But gold is also like Roman Numerals, unwieldy and limited. The largest Roman Numeral was M for 1,000, so once numbers got serious they also got impossible. The same thing happens if you try to travel with, say, 50 pounds of gold in your pocket.\nGold can stand in for small values, in a pinch. A few ounces will carry value in any country where you find yourself. But any more than that and you’re going to be weighted down. Land in any civilized country and you’re better off carrying a bitcoin wallet. The Bottom Line\nThe price of gold peaked in late 2011, at slightly over $1,800 per ounce. It currently sits at about $1,354 , midway between that and its January 2016 low of under $1,100.\nThat, however, is only its price against one currency. Measured against the ruble, gold looks better. Measured against a collapsed currency like that of Zimbabwe or Venezuela and it looks even better, if you can keep it safe.\nIt’s safety, and life, that’s the real store of value. If the global economy collapses, that will be all that matters.\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $9,375 on Bitfinex.\nAs CCN reported, mining firms have been rapidly scaling up their operations following last year’s prolonged bull market. Bitmain, the world’s dominant mining hardware manufacturer, is said to have made as much as $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, and Canaan — its largest competitor — is preparing to hold an initial public offering (IPO) that it believes will provide it with a $1 billion valuation.\nFundstrat has long been bullish on bitcoin. Founder Tom Lee has argued that, among younger investors, cryptocurrencies are rapidly replacing gold as the most popular “store of value,” and the firm has published a number of analyses that suggest the ecosystem will experience sustained long-term growth.\nThe firm has set its year-end price target at $25,000 for 2018 and has previously said that bitcoin could rise as high as $91,o00 by early 2020.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:41:30.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddce1c3ee97f32e9551b923b5e8556255fb40c5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCo.7oEKXPeWLcmwKf16rc1yV9UwVBVDSqGi3HQDSePxR4T5NRQhdy.tnejpbo_5_0ub1K3_1oOeezmX4wyagzItg4UzaWifkWbOcjUmq4Jc48rMJBSm1WKsLAGIkLAgq1c1zANZlp8o6Q--", "site_full": "blog.mccopro.com", "site": "mccopro.com", "site_section": "http://blog.mccopro.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "McCoPro.com", "title": "Three ways Bitcoin could be brought down, co-opted, or made irrelevant", "title_full": "Three ways Bitcoin could be brought down, co-opted, or made irrelevant", "published": "2018-05-10T18:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ddce1c3ee97f32e9551b923b5e8556255fb40c5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCo.7oEKXPeWLcmwKf16rc1yV9UwVBVDSqGi3HQDSePxR4T5NRQhdy.tnejpbo_5_0ub1K3_1oOeezmX4wyagzItg4UzaWifkWbOcjUmq4Jc48rMJBSm1WKsLAGIkLAgq1c1zANZlp8o6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "McCoPro", "published": "2018-05-10T18:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Three ways Bitcoin could be brought down, co-opted, or made irrelevant", "text": "The Frager factor: Today: Death, Bitcoin, Hypnotism, Self-driving cars, Freelancing, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett\nModel Created by Coleen Baik from Felicia Sullivan on Vimeo.\nFive tips that helped me survive five years of freelancing\nLet’s Destroy Bitcoin\nThree ways Bitcoin could be brought down, co-opted, or made irrelevant\nLo…", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felicia sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleen baik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T05:01:24.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d55c0ac999f0b8bdad41d048a01495416a2f9fcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYAL0cN0EkN2Y.3ZOZVLqFYkdbJlCs6jNnTb3kI9Kze04aLPhOriDbRV1o8K1p5vESDvhsiV22mvvHslDzPkd2z5rdhgE8_LA-", "site_full": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/world/?format=rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo News UK & Ireland - Latest World News & UK News Headlines", "title": "‘Bitcoin Jesus’ predicts ethereum will be most valuable cryptocurrency by end of year", "title_full": "‘Bitcoin Jesus’ predicts ethereum will be most valuable cryptocurrency by end of year", "published": "2018-05-10T18:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KqmEORMuqU04VxBHYURlIA--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/aa689d6fefa6ab6bc9acdb4a26377198", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d55c0ac999f0b8bdad41d048a01495416a2f9fcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYAL0cN0EkN2Y.3ZOZVLqFYkdbJlCs6jNnTb3kI9Kze04aLPhOriDbRV1o8K1p5vESDvhsiV22mvvHslDzPkd2z5rdhgE8_LA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T18:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Bitcoin Jesus’ predicts ethereum will be most valuable cryptocurrency by end of year", "text": "‘Bitcoin Jesus’ predicts ethereum will be most valuable cryptocurrency by end of year Anthony Cuthbertson Bitcoin rivals like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash are all competing to become the world's most valuable cryptocurrency: Getty Images More Bitcoin will soon lose its place as the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, according to one of the earliest advocates of the digital currency. Roger Ver, whose involvement in the space since 2011 has earned him the moniker ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, believes technologically superior cryptocurrencies like ethereum and bitcoin cash will see massive gains in the coming months and years. A significant surge in their value will likely correlate with more modest gains for bitcoin, according to Mr Ver, leading to what analysts have termed “The Flippening” - the point in time when bitcoin no longer the cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization. “I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr Ver told The Independent . “Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.” The #Flippening is nigh :) — Marius Kjærstad (@MKjrstad) 10 May 2018 Mr Ver cited issues with bitcoin’s core technology, which has seen it beleaguered with slow transaction times and high fees as its popularity has increased. More than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have come into existence since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, each one trying to overcome one or more of bitcoin’s flaws. Increasing interest in bitcoin over the last year has been reflected across the cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum and bitcoin cash making significant gains on bitcoin. In the past 12 months, the price of one bitcoin has risen from around $1,700 to $9,360 - an increase of 450 per cent. In the same timeframe, ethereum has seen gains of almost 1,000 per cent to reach its current value of $764, while bitcoin cash has surged from around $500 in August last year to today’s price of $1,655. The price of ethereum may still be a long way off bitcoin, however there are five-times more in circulation - meaning ethereum’s market cap is just under half that of bitcoin’s. Other cryptocurrency experts contend that bitcoin is too well established to lose its position as the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. Michael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works for the investment firm Mangrove Capital Partners, believed the issues that blight bitcoin can be overcome, therefore negating the benefits of alternative cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash. “There is so much talent in the crypto space, and people are working on solving these scalability problems,” Mr Jackson said. “I don’t see why bitcoin shouldn’t remain in the number one spot. It is still by far the best known and it is ultimately the reserve currency in the space.” Bitcoin could remain the world’s dominant cryptocurrency, Mr Ver conceded, but he does not believe such a scenario is likely. While its perceived limitations may see its price stagnate, the utility of bitcoin cash could see its price reach “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in the future. “It’s not guaranteed but it is much more likely to happen than not,” Mr Ver said. “Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Flippening?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-global-cryptocurrency-goldman-sachs-trump-advisor-gary-cohn-a8342701.html&quot;", "https://twitter.com/MKjrstad/status/994388739500670976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-global-cryptocurrency-goldman-sachs-trump-advisor-gary-cohn-a8342701.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "anthony cuthbe", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:49:55.108+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1f9a4fc51e6f0d67a1d4f0900aeb4adea57b0af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniOJT_Ads2bzLzqb1pW4jBoMDqdSpUXq18qyHW01lM9b.GGN3vZimqDxjCHqE0wbdNKw3lFk6qGyzmNNHqYiYaVc-", "site_full": "www.firstorderhistorians.com", "site": "firstorderhistorians.com", "site_section": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Iran applies in the face of US sanctions on Bitcoin", "title_full": "Iran applies in the face of US sanctions on Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1551ec484bec06d3eead8515adb44c20.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1f9a4fc51e6f0d67a1d4f0900aeb4adea57b0af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniOJT_Ads2bzLzqb1pW4jBoMDqdSpUXq18qyHW01lM9b.GGN3vZimqDxjCHqE0wbdNKw3lFk6qGyzmNNHqYiYaVc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top News", "published": "2018-05-10T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iran applies in the face of US sanctions on Bitcoin", "text": "Bitcoin, Crypto currency, Blockchain Iran applies in the face of US sanctions on Bitcoin\nAfter Donald Trump announced a few days ago that he will apply the “strongest economic sanctions” against Iran, could Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s President is turning to Bitcoin to survive “a new Gulf crisis.”\nAccording to a report in the The Guardian published Trump a Statement in the White House, in which of Iran’s nuclear agreement remove.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

May 10, 2018, 11:13 am EDT May 10, 2018 Will Bitcoin Hit $15000 Again? There was a very specific reason bitcoin reversed course in December http://bit.ly/2IbA4fC Source: Shutterstock\nOn Dec 10, bitcoin hit a high near $19,870. It then abruptly reversed course for several weeks, bottoming out under $7,000 near the end of the first quarter. With the cryptocurrency having recovered to nearly the $10,000 mark, the question on everyone’s mind is whether or not it will continue to recover. So will Bitcoin hit 15,000 again?\nLet’s look at some predictions. The Analysts Weigh In on Bitcoin Source: tradingview.com\nLast week, Warren Buffett bashed bitcoin during a CNBC interview. Then again, he also bought into the newspaper industry just a few years ago. Everyone’s wrong sometimes. Indeed, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said Buffett was dead wrong and compared the cryptocurrency to gold .\nAnd so goes the conversation about bitcoin projections: hardcore believers and hardcore skeptics going back and forth… and back and forth.\nIn fact, new research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve showed that bitcoin’s reversal as it neared $20,000 was a result of the launch of a futures market, as those skeptics could put their money where their pessimism was. According to an Economic Letter from the San Francisco Fed, on Dec 17, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced bitcoin futures, and the subsequent price fall doesn’t seem to be a coincidence.\n“Before December 2017, there was no market for bitcoin derivatives. This meant that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline in bitcoin price,” the researchers wrote. As you can see on the chart, bitcoin reached its high on Dec 16.\n“With the introduction of bitcoin futures, pessimists could bet on a bitcoin price decline, buying and selling contracts with a lower delivery price in the future than the spot price,” they added. Compare Brokers\nAfter drawing this connection, the researchers also addressed bitcoin predictions. Where is the cryptocurrency going? “This is a very difficult question, and we do not pretend to be able to forecast bitcoin prices, nor will we offer any guesses.”\nBut they did outline several factors that will affect the price of bitcoin going forward, mainly the transactional demand — which will be affected by the availability of other cryptocurrencies and the acceptance of bitcoin by traditional financial institutions — compared to supply. The Bottom Line for Bitcoin\nIn light of these factors, I believe bitcoin will indeed recover to the $15,000 level.\nAs the researchers point out, the factors that caused the significant decline in value are a standard response to the introduction of a futures market. They were not a reflection of the a shift in supply or other fundamental indicators. For instance, word on the street is that Goldman Sachs has plans to set up a crypto trading desk.

In the first instance, the patent mentions “a data stream that publishes or includes global bitcoin transactions (or any cryptocurrency transaction)” for use by electronic or internet retailers.\nEven more concerning still is the second example which explains how the tech can be used specifically by cops to keep tabs on users and track purchases made with crypto:\nFor example, a law enforcement agency may be a customer and may desire to receive global bitcoin transactions, correlated by country, with ISP data to determine source IP addresses and shipping addresses that correlate to bitcoin addresses. The agency may not want additional available enhancements such as local bank data records. The streaming data marketplace may price this desired data out per GB (gigabyte), for example, and the agency can start running analytics on the desired data using the analysis module.\nStatists gonna state.\nAnonymity and decentralization are paramount to crypto’s value as an alternative currency---freedom from the prying eyes of government goons is reason enough to use it.\nBut the ring of power as symbolized in The Lord of the Rings is too alluring for even the most successful private companies, and Jeff Bezos is proving to be yet another casualty seduced by it.\nUsing the government patenting system to monopolize control over a technology that tracks Bitcoin transactions--- that’s about as fascistic as it gets.\nBut apparently, it’s happening. Are we now witnessing the final stage of the co-opting of bitcoin?\nThis is exactly why the real ring of power needs to be destroyed altogether---and cryptocurrencies on the whole offer society one of our best hopes to achieve that.\nThis also reinforces why other cryptos, which we have recommended, including Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Monero, are so important. In various ways, each of them offers potential privacy options that bitcoin, due to its being morphed into “digital gold” is now less able to provide.\nSome want to use state-sponsored regulations to crack down on blockchains, but thankfully, “we the people” may be just too far ahead of the inefficient, archaic bureau-rats for them to catch up.\nThis is an epic battle that will continue being waged for years to come, with the forces of good fighting to offer cryptocurrencies that can free people, versus the state’s ongoing attempts to sequester us.\nYou know which side we’re on.\nJoin us and thousands of TDV newsletter subscribers who’ve earned incredible wealth on crypto and further liberated ourselves from the evil empire’s clutches (subscribe HERE ).\nYouTube 553 Videos | 124,495 Subscribers\nUpcoming Events Beach Blockchain Summit Start date: May 10, 2018\nEnd date: May 11, 2018\nLocation: CEBU, Phillipines\nMore Info\nThe world famous white sand beach of Boracay will be the venue for the first in a series of the Beach Blockchain Conference.

Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold? Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady. Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states. The outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares. Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.” Xapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft. The first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar. The most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense. Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards. “They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.” At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers...

In a patent published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Winklevoss IP detailed a way to make transactions for ETPs that hold digital currencies “such as bitcoins … Ripple, Dogecoins … Ether.”\nThe office awarded the patent a few months after the company filed in December. The brothers had also wanted to list an ETF that was related to bitcoin on the Bats BZX Exchange, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nixed the listing due to uncertainty with regulatory issues and trading risks.\nAnd a token that is dubbed “the world’s first invite-only cryptocurrency” has announced $1 million in self-funding, the company said in an announcement . Merit also claims that it is the first digital currency to feature blockchain-based, decentralized vaults and escrows.\n“The cryptocurrency has stumbled away from its decentralized roots and diverted to a winner-take-all Wall Street mentality,” Merit founder and CEO Adil Wali said in the announcement. “At Merit, we strive to get back to the original ethos of cryptocurrency: to use the power of blockchain technology to actually make our lives easier. We want it to be so easy to use that our least tech-savvy friends and family could use it every day.”\nIn other news, astrological signs have encouraged former NFL player Ricky Williams to invest in bitcoin, CNBC reported. The news isn’t entirely out of character, as William studied astrology and holistic medicine following his football career.\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” Williams told CNBC. He noticed that Uranus was about to unite with Taurus, and that is important because Uranus is about “revolution” and Taurus is about “resources and finances.” Additionally, Pluto is moving through Capricorn – that “is about our structures, like banks for instance,” Williams said.\nStill, Williams was careful not to put too much money into bitcoin: He only invested $50,000.\n-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/the-winklevoss-brothers-have-won-a-crypto-etp-patent/", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509005407/en/Merit-Emerges-Stealth-Announces-1M-Funding-Availability", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html", "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=9,965,805.PN.&OS=pn/9,965,805&RS=PN/9,965,805"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adil wa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "winklevoss twins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trademark office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:36:40.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "033664960c2dc10dd2706394ad409adf4617882f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Yklt5DtyRZWY34LmOcgh.yeIi_FEwa53CVxRSAWFujj8vPv6v8MtmpcDuAwwORMG0GQUedNF57RTYMkMaA6yz4rhphMU0zs8N_A--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitcoin Proves Itself At $9,000.00 In Market Decline", "title_full": "Bitcoin Proves Itself At $9,000.00 In Market Decline : btc", "published": "2018-05-10T18:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.23, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "033664960c2dc10dd2706394ad409adf4617882f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Yklt5DtyRZWY34LmOcgh.yeIi_FEwa53CVxRSAWFujj8vPv6v8MtmpcDuAwwORMG0GQUedNF57RTYMkMaA6yz4rhphMU0zs8N_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Crypto_Daily", "published": "2018-05-10T18:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Proves Itself At $9,000.00 In Market Decline", "text": "submitted by /u/Crypto_Daily\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/05/bitcoin-proves-9000-00-market-decline/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:23:57.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25232e60dd999e8c4a356763ed372c4b2643fed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFpeOuAVrbYzFW_P54aMLLBME_AwE2gjP10ns9HuK.BME7VB63prtvzSAbKDGT_MIODlY8tpMDnjbz8dDQONZPcH", "site_full": "googlereferral.com", "site": "googlereferral.com", "site_section": "http://googlereferral.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Google Adsense Referral News", "title": "Anyone used bitcoin before?", "title_full": "Anyone used bitcoin before?", "published": "2018-05-10T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "25232e60dd999e8c4a356763ed372c4b2643fed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFpeOuAVrbYzFW_P54aMLLBME_AwE2gjP10ns9HuK.BME7VB63prtvzSAbKDGT_MIODlY8tpMDnjbz8dDQONZPcH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Anyone used bitcoin before?", "text": "Sign up for Free Hosting Exchange Links\nNothing to sign up for, no registering, no forms, and no email to answer.

Crypto mining economics lead/explain $BTC price—suggests $39,000 per bitcoin by YE19. key takeaways below… pic.twitter.com/f5ZQ4py3jS\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 10, 2018\nDoctor added that although $36,000 is the most likely target for the bitcoin price according to this analysis, it could end up anywhere in the $20,000 to $64,000 range depending how the landscape develops over the next 18 months.\nEven the lower end of that range represents a 113 percent increase from the current bitcoin price, while the more optimistic target represents a 583 percent surge. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $9,375 on Bitfinex.\nAs CCN reported , mining firms have been rapidly scaling up their operations following last year’s prolonged bull market. Bitmain, the world’s dominant mining hardware manufacturer, is said to have made as much as $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, and Canaan — its largest competitor — is preparing to hold an initial public offering (IPO) that it believes will provide it with a $1 billion valuation.\nFundstrat has long been bullish on bitcoin. Founder Tom Lee has argued that, among younger investors, cryptocurrencies are rapidly replacing gold as the most popular “store of value,” and the firm has published a number of analyses that suggest the ecosystem will experience sustained long-term growth.\nThe firm has set its year-end price target at $25,000 for 2018 and has previously said that bitcoin could rise as high as $91,000 by early 2020.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.

Therefore, it's fair to ask whether Bitcoin's repeated failure to surpass the 200-day moving average is indicative of underlying weakness, or is confirmation bias fueling investors' dreams of Bitcoin price above $10,000?\nMarket Overview The third time has not been the charm for bitcoin as it bounced off the 200-day MA after an exciting run up to $9,990. While a pullback from the $10,000 resistance was expected, the drop below $9,000 was a bit harsher than expected.\nA quick glance at the top 10 cryptocurrencies shows a handful recovering from 10 to 15% drops and BTC has recovered some ground to sit slightly above the $9,200 support. While the pullback from $9,990 is indicative of bullish exhaustion, general market sentiment remains positive as the cryptocurrency market capitalization steadily creeps towards $500 billion.\nMost investors appear unconcerned within the current correction and the majority of FUD seems to be wafting from a trio of cantankerous fuddy duddies who compare bitcoin trading with cow pats, casinos, rat poison , and ' harvested baby brains '.\nAll FUD aside, encouraging developments that are likely to accelerate BTC momentum are occurring. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently announced that it intends to offer BTC swap contracts that will be settled in BTC rather than fiat.\nGoldman Sachs confirmed plans to open a cryptocurrency trading desk within weeks and Mike Novogratz has decided to have another go at opening a crypto trading index. Next week New York will host the world's largest cryptocurrency conference (Consensus) and Fundstrat research analyst Tom Lee predicts BTC is in for a 'massive ' rally due to the excitement surrounding this momentous event.\nHighlights BTC was predominately bullish for most of last week as the cryptocurrency passed through multiple resistance levels only to run out of steam at $9,990. April's rally brought back memories of the late 2017 cryptocurrency euphoria but hopes have been continuously dashed each time BTC failed to cross the 200-Day MA. The on May 9th Bitcoin price sunk to a weekly low below $9,000 as bears broke the support at $9,200 and continued their work on the $9,000 support.\nAs seen on the daily chart, BTC toppled out of the ascending trend line and set lower lows and lower highs, indicating short term weakness as the bears attempt to take charge.\nDaily Chart Since yesterday BTC has been working to recover lost ground, retaking the $9,200 support but struggling to reach $9,400. Various iterations of the simple moving averages highlight the dissolution of bullish bias and at the time of writing the RSI is turning down from 50 and the MACD is currently below bearish territory.\nThe 5 and 10-day MA have reversed course and appear to be closing the distance between each other but a turnaround won't begin until BTC trades above the 50 MA.\n4HR Chart BTC still needs to cross the 50 MA at $9,450 and previously, movement past $9,500 provided a path towards $9,700 and eventually $10,000. Gains above $9,780 would place BTC back into the ascending channel and a close above the 50 SMA ($9,450) would signal that the downtrend has finished.\nIf BTC is unable to recover, there is strong support at $8800 and $8350. It's possible that BTC could trade in this range before the rally to $10,500 – $11,200 continues.\nNext Test for Bitcoin Price Momentum should improve when $9,500 is passed but the 200-day MA remains a major resistance. The next tests for BTC should be at $10,500, $11,250 and $11,750 levels of resistance.\nIf the downtrend continues and BTC closes below $9,000, a drop to $8,800 and below could take place. Bearing this in mind, aggressive traders should take caution and initiate 50% positions whereas longs could add to their positions.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Currently, the largest digital currency trades just over $9,300 with a market capitalization of $159.43 billion.\nBitcoin prices surged 35% in April and are flirting with the psychologically important $10,000 level, an impressive rebound from a decline that saw the king of cryptocurrencies slump more than 60% from its December peak around $20,000.\nSome cryptocurrency market observers believe bitcoin will eventually reclaim its record highs and that the alt-coin’s recent bear market was normal.\n“Bitcoin has gained over 55% since the beginning of April, while it moved from $6425 up to $9900. The $10k area remains a key resistance for the Bitcoin as it is a very strong psychological level,” reports FXStreet . “As price failed to break above a correction down followed and currently Bitcoin is trading at the 23.6% Fibonacci support, that is $9225.” What’s Next for Bitcoin?\nSome cryptocurrency market observers believe that if bitcoin can make it back to $10,000, rallies fromt there could be significant. Recently, the Bitcoin Dominance Index has been rising, confirming the dominant perch of the cryptocurrency. After bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.\nBitcoin’s rally above $9,000 comes just a couple of weeks after the cryptocurrency committed a death cross, where its 200-day moving average fell below its 50-day line. The death cross is normally bearish, but it needs to be validated, something bitcoin did not do.

just $39 per month.\nTech investor Chamath Palihapitiya considers himself a “disciple” of Warren Buffett, but even he does not think the investing icon is a reliable source on the subject of bitcoin.\nPalihapitiya, who served in various management roles during a four-year tenure at Facebook, told CNBC that technology is outside of Buffett’s “circle of competence,” so he is not inclined to put much stock in his thoughts about a cutting-edge digital asset like bitcoin.\n“Not everybody is right all the time,” he said.\nAs CCN reported, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman — along with Charlie Munger, his top lieutenant — went on another bitcoin bashing spree this month in concert with the firm’s annual shareholders meeting.\nSpeaking at Saturday’s shareholders’ meeting, Buffett said that bitcoin was “rat poison squared” and that cryptocurrencies would “come to a bad ending.”\nMunger made similar comments and later claimed in an interview that bitcoin was almost as bad as “trading freshly harvested baby brains.”\nMicrosoft CEO Bill Gates — who also sits on the Berkshire board of directors — entered the fray as well in post-shareholders meeting interviews, lamenting that he would short bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it (there is).\nPalihapitiya, in contrast, said that he recommends investors hold a small amount of bitcoin as insurance against widespread economic crises, which will drag down every asset that is associated with traditional financial markets.\nHe said:\n“My portfolio is 99 percent risk on, one percent risk off. In that one percent risk off bucket, I think that something like bitcoin is really important. Why? Because it’s not correlated to the rest of the market.”\nIn the past, Palihapitiya has lauded bitcoin for its censorship resistance, alleging that no individual or organization — or government for that matter — has the ability to control it.\n“Nobody can stop it because nobody can control it. The idea that the government can put curbs on this is actually pretty specious,” he said last September.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palihapitiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chamath palihapitiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:41:31.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b267eeb9ce3a77991e343049feea1f047c1da63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQo10kwt2zEKroiLfJSdADUIZDtqURnrYAqOJR7L4ls.p_zGR28umu9", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban", "title_full": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban", "published": "2018-05-10T17:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b267eeb9ce3a77991e343049feea1f047c1da63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQo10kwt2zEKroiLfJSdADUIZDtqURnrYAqOJR7L4ls.p_zGR28umu9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T17:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban", "text": "\nBank of America CTO Kathy Bessant has told mainstream media customers will continue to be banned from buying Bitcoin using its credit cards.\nBank of America (BoA) doubled down on its decision to stop customers buying Bitcoin with its credit cards May 10.

Cryptos is the antithesis of that,” she added.\n“Just like we don't allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we're not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.”\nWeeks after the initial ban, BoA produced a report conversely identifying future risks to its business, in which it highlighted its “inability to adapt” to the competition cryptocurrency poses.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathy bessant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank of america cto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reconfirms credit card purchase ban  bank of america cto kathy bessant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:41:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aaee701bda14f0a2def11bba1faa07678bc4d4cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRTJaJxS4ehrJIqwGtwlONA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-10T17:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aaee701bda14f0a2def11bba1faa07678bc4d4cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRTJaJxS4ehrJIqwGtwlONA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Allura74", "published": "2018-05-10T17:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: ir.yance on Today at 09:25:18 AM there are several reasons the government forbids bitcoin because buyers and sellers can not be known, in addition many criminals use bitcoin as an intermediary to buy weapons and drugs.\nI suggest the government make a rule about bitcoin so no one uses bitcoin for crime.\nWell, I think crime involving assets is everywhere and even fiat are no escape of that so even if bitcoin is decentralized then maybe they should not make that doubtful reason to accused bitcoin as crime related transaction.
