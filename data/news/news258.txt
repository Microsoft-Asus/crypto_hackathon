for Bitcoin Trading Coinbase Plans Low-Latency Colocation for Bitcoin Trading Subscribe\nWall Street is embracing bitcoin and ready to build a financial ecosystem around cryptocurrency. That includes low-latency colocation, which has been a significant business for data center companies in major financial hubs.\nBitcoin specialist Coinbase, which manages more than $20 billion in cryptocurrency assets, has announced its entry into the data center business as part of a suite of services for institutional investors. With its Coinbase Markets offering, the company will provide a centralized pool of liquidity for all its cryptocurrency products, which currently include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.\n‚ÄúOver the course of the year Coinbase Markets will introduce new features like low latency performance, on-premise datacenter colocation services, institutional connectivity and access, and settlement and clearing services,‚Äù the company said . ‚ÄúThese additions will allow for a more efficient price discovery process to occur, creating tighter markets, deeper liquidity, and increased certainty of execution.‚Äù A New Opportunity in Cryptocurrency?\nThe emergence of low-latency trading for bitcoin marks a potential shift in the data center industry‚Äôs relationship with the cryptocurrency world. Until now, the primary bitcoin-related use of data centers was for ‚Äúmining‚Äù‚Äì processing transactions to secure the blockchain, an online ledger. Bitcoin miners yearn for cheap space and power, and lots of it. They typically run high-density racks and invest less in backup infrastructure, which is a key component of the value of a commercial data center.\nAs a result, utility-scale bitcoin mining has largely become a do-it-yourself operation in which companies create ‚Äúhashing centers‚Äù in warehouses, modular data centers or immersion containers in which servers are dunked in pools of coolant. Some data center providers have begun offering ‚Äúvariable resiliency‚Äù space with limited generator or UPS support as a lower-priced option for bitcoin mining companies.

If this ecosystem succeeds, it would create a more lucrative opportunity for data centers to provide services driven by surging interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency Arrives on Main Street, Wall Street\nWall Street firms have long been fascinated with bitcoin and blockchain technologies, and are now developing products allowing investors to profit from price movements in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin futures launched late last year, sparking a historic run-up in price for bitcoin.\nCoinbase, a San Francisco firm backed by some of Silicon Valley‚Äôs largest venture capital firms, is moving aggressively to capitalize on that interest. The company is launching a suite of products that include trading tools, market research, crypto storage and custody, auditing and reporting, and a ‚Äúwhite-glove service to help institutional investors navigate the increasingly complex world of crypto asset investing.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere is clear demand from institutional clients and financial services professionals for more specific solutions with regard to cryptocurrencies that address their sophisticated needs,‚Äù said Adam White, Vice President and General Manager of Coinbase Institutional. ‚ÄúThrough new products like Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Custody, we‚Äôre building the necessary capability for institutions that allows cryptocurrencies to be traded and stored in a compliant, trusted and efficient manner.‚Äù Coinbase Focused on Chicago\nCoinbase‚Äôs move into colocation summons echoes of the financial industry‚Äôs focus on high-frequency trading (HFT), which created demand for proximity colocation, in which providers could charge a premium for data center space near the matching engines for major exchanges. Low-latency trading boosted the data center business in Northern New Jersey and Chicago, particularly for providers like Equinix, Savvis and Telx that housed key exchange infrastructure. Free Resource from Data Center Frontier White Paper Library Thinking about Colocation?

Download It Now.\nCoinbase is focusing its operations on Chicago, the largest trading hub for commodities and related products. This decision is likely driven by U.S. government policy, which treats bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than currencies.\nCoinbase is based in San Francisco, but has opened an office in Chicago and is hiring a team of engineers. The company‚Äôs Chicago operations are led by Paul Bauerschmidt, a former executive of the CME.\nCoinbase hasn‚Äôt provided details on its plans for data center services, or how much capacity it will need to launch and grow the services. The Chicago data center market features several financial trading hubs, most prominently the Digital Realty carrier hotel at 350 East Cermak, which houses a low-latency trading ecosystem for Equinix. Both CoreSite and Digital Realty operate data centers in the financial district, immediately adjacent to major exchanges. A new player is the CyrusOne campus in Aurora, which houses electronic trading operations for the CME Group.\nWe‚Äôve reached out to Coinbase seeking additional details ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coinbase-announces-institutional-suite-of-products-and-adds-chicago-office-to-better-serve-institutions-300648395.html", "https://twitter.com/share?text=The+emergence+of+low-latency+trading+for+bitcoin+marks+a+potential+shift+in+the+data+center+industry%27s+relationship+with+the+cryptocurrency+world.&url=https://datacenterfrontier.com/coinbase-plans-low-latency-colocation-for-cryptocurrency-trading/", "http://goo.gl/oIauSI"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rich miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equinix", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "n.j.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secaucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T23:23:50.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6c838e6d6e9dbdbf6d3969adfd94f479927d1cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmURT1fN6GptHpOHnZAPf79c-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "Do you think Bitcoin can ruin a Country?", "title_full": "Do you think Bitcoin can ruin a Country?", "published": "2018-05-15T18:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6c838e6d6e9dbdbf6d3969adfd94f479927d1cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmURT1fN6GptHpOHnZAPf79c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pattart", "published": "2018-05-15T18:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Do you think Bitcoin can ruin a Country?", "text": "No bicoin does not ruin any country.The bitcoin is also a certain type of currency.And i dont think so at any currency can harm any country", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:55:12.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "294c73106ce72c72f386dd50885ac92689c1b15f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1oexBtWdkf4ADLUi3nmUwDE", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Hardware Manufacturers Seek Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing", "title_full": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Hardware Manufacturers Seek Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing", "published": "2018-05-15T18:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "294c73106ce72c72f386dd50885ac92689c1b15f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1oexBtWdkf4ADLUi3nmUwDE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T18:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Hardware Manufacturers Seek Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing", "text": "8 hours ago Chinese Bitcoin Mining Hardware Manufacturers Seek Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing Bitcoin mining manufacturers have seen a lot of success over the past few years.

Seminole becomes the first county to accept payments in bitcoin cash and bitcoin in the United States.\nJoel Greenberg, the State tax collector, announced the County would begin using BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor, to receive payments starting June 2018.\nSource: SeminoleTax\nSeminole residents will be able to make an array of payments using virtual currencies including property taxes as well as fees relating to tags, driver's license, titles and ID cards.\nDigital Currencies: Ideal Choice From his statement, Greenberg seemed to appreciate cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, the blockchain , as appropriate tech innovations for driving efficient service delivery in the County.\nAcknowledging the need to shift to cryptocurrencies, Greenberg highlighted features such as transparency, efficiency, fraud resistance and accuracy that make digital currencies an ideal choice for his office.\n\"We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, and we should expect the same from our government,\" his statement read in part.\n\"The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.\"\nEven so, Greenberg's move to accept cryptocurrency payments seems to be aligned to the commitment he made to his voters in 2016. During the campaigns, he promised the people of Seminole county that he would introduce new technologies.\nGrowing Interest For BitPay, the partnership with Seminole County is highly significant because it is the first of its kind for the company.\nJeremie Beaudry, Head of Compliance at BitPay said, \"With the Seminole County Tax Collector's office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.\"\nHowever, Seminole County isn't the only government office that has taken steps to integrate cryptocurrencies into its payment system.\nEarlier in 2018, legislators in states such as Georgia and Arizona proposed laws aimed at allowing payment of state taxes using virtual currencies like bitcoin.\nIs the Juice Worth the Squeeze? Even as Seminole County hopes to utilize BitPay to facilitate fast and cheaper payments for its residents, there are concerns that transactions on the Bitcoin network might be too expensive, even impractical for small amounts.\nAt the peak of cryptocurrency popularity and price in December 2017, bitcoin transaction costs hit a high of $37 for a single transaction which forced BitPay to disallow purchases below $100.\nCurrently, a single bitcoin transaction costs about $1.26 . In addition to this, Seminole County residents will be expected to cater for a one percent transaction fee payable to BitPay.\nThe post Seminole County, Florida Embraces Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Payments appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "semi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seminoletax seminole", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida embraces bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:34:32.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "896da80ec45452a2d41ce3b2d2167e279f951183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrLzT6JjHcj6zXi_Fl.PTN8e9hUw9.PRMk-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6964", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Stockhouse Newswire", "title": "Bitcoin Bump; Consensus Conference NYC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Bump; Consensus Conference NYC", "published": "2018-05-15T18:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "896da80ec45452a2d41ce3b2d2167e279f951183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrLzT6JjHcj6zXi_Fl.PTN8e9hUw9.PRMk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T18:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Bump; Consensus Conference NYC", "text": "May 15, 2018 at 11:48 AM EDT Bitcoin Bump; Consensus Conference NYC Bitcoin Bump; Consensus Conference NYC ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.prconnect.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:11:03.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d04504125b0c3b03f120786a2d921b1d3ff21a3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QVxtWoI94YHo6UUrReC7PieXLdMX9AGa8WlHB_gTshz7l90J4Ubka11zE9FbeDjh9Flr0hy8CudHJyIu188avRNVP_maQe2wT4S_L676GMUfnKWq2g_YfbcVMUq7W589U-", "site_full": "askkristi.com", "site": "askkristi.com", "site_section": "http://askkristi.com/feed", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Ask Kristi", "title": "Why Bitcoin Dropped $300 ‚Äì It Can Reach $64,000 By 2019 ‚Äì Ripple To Launch New Product", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin Dropped $300 ‚Äì It Can Reach $64,000 By 2019 ‚Äì Ripple To Launch New Product", "published": "2018-05-15T18:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/askkristi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05ukvdculid05hdvu-1526399303.jpg?fit=480%2C270", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d04504125b0c3b03f120786a2d921b1d3ff21a3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QVxtWoI94YHo6UUrReC7PieXLdMX9AGa8WlHB_gTshz7l90J4Ubka11zE9FbeDjh9Flr0hy8CudHJyIu188avRNVP_maQe2wT4S_L676GMUfnKWq2g_YfbcVMUq7W589U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ksayles", "published": "2018-05-15T18:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin Dropped $300 ‚Äì It Can Reach $64,000 By 2019 ‚Äì Ripple To Launch New Product", "text": "Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

swissinfo.ch\nOpposing views\nWill price volatility be the death of bitcoin?\nBy Matthew Allen\n Business\n in depth: Fintech Switzerland\n See in other languages: 3\nThis content was published on May 3, 2018 11:00 AMMay 3, 2018 - 11:00\nCars pass a roundabout with the allegedly world's first Bitcoin monument in Kranj, Slovenia\nOver the past year the price of a single bitcoin raced from around $1,000 (CHF996) to $20,000; it now trades for around $7,000\n(Keystone)\nThe dramatic price volatility of bitcoin could be solved by accepting the cryptocurrency into the established financial system. That‚Äôs the opinion of Jon Matonis, a founder of the Bitcoin Foundation. But it‚Äôs also a view that flies in the face of bitcoin critics.\nOver the past year the price of a single bitcoin raced from around $1,000 (CHF996) to $20,000; it now trades for around $7,000. On April 12, the price suddenly shot up to $8,000 in the space of an hour, probably due to the activities of a large trader.\nAt present a relatively small number of bitcoin hoarders, known as ‚Äòwhales‚Äô, or larger-scale traders can send prices rocketing in one direction or another. But were governments to add bitcoin to their reserve currencies or if mainstream exchanges were to allow bitcoin to trade alongside dollars, euros and francs, the story would be different, Matonis argues.\n+ Has Switzerland blown its cypto-opportunity?\nJon Matonis, a founder of the Bitcoin Foundation.\nJon Matonis, founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation\n(Getty/Bloomsberg)\n‚ÄúVolatility results from inadequate liquidity on exchanges. The exchange infrastructure needs to be more robust so that when someone sells ‚Ç¨10 million (CHF12 million) worth of bitcoin that shouldn‚Äôt move the market,‚Äù he told swissinfo.ch on the fringes of a crypto conference in Zurich.\n‚ÄúThe market is so thin right now that when established players move in with orders of that magnitude you see this volatility.‚Äù\nHuge spikes and troughs of inflation and deflation make bitcoin an unreliable form of payment. If you can‚Äôt tell how much your bitcoin will be worth from one month to the next, how can you rely on it as a form of income or use it to buy goods and services?\nThe arguments against\nBitcoin detractors including Credit Suisse Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Adriano B Lucatelli, founder of Swiss fintech firm Descartes and lecturer at the University of Zurich. They argue that bitcoin is a fad with no intrinsic value, driven by the irrational enthusiasm of amateur investors and prey to speculators.\nFrom being an early enthusiast of bitcoin as a decentralised private currency outside the influence of central banks and governments, Lucatelli has lost his zeal after witnessing its volatility. Speaking at the Crypto Mountain Rocksexternal link conference in Davos last month, Lucatelli compared bitcoin to the dotcom bubble hype.\nBitcoin only has a value so long as investors believe they can convert their speculation back into normal currencies. ‚ÄúIf people start to fear they can‚Äôt switch back, it‚Äôs dead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll the beliefs that people have about bitcoin are wrong. Eventually everyone will realise that. When everyone is running out of the door you will have a squeeze and a lot of people licking their wounds.‚Äù\nMatonis disagrees with the doomsday predictions despite recognising that the decentralised bitcoin currency faces an uphill task in being accepted by the mainstream financial sector.\n‚ÄúWhen bitcoin starts to be used as a reserve asset to back the ‚Äòfunny money‚Äô [fiat] that central banks are printing it takes game to another level. Then you will have true competition between crypto and central bank money and the best will prevail. But the authorities fail to look at it this way because they know that it threatens central bank money,‚Äù he said.\nStable coin projects\nMatonis rejects the ‚Äúbabbling nonsense‚Äù of central banks producing digital cash ‚Äì in other words, taking bitcoin‚Äôs technology whilst centralising control. This would ‚Äústrip out the innovation‚Äù of a fixed limited supply of coins plus decentralisation that would spare people from central bank currency manipulation, he said.\nGlobal efforts are already underway to produce a stable cryptocurrency, mainly be pegging the tokens to underlying assets. One notable example is Tether, that claims to be backed by US dollars, but its claims to have a dollar in reserve for each token it mints are reportedly under investigation by the US authorities.\nIn Switzerland, the SwissRealCoin and Tiberius Coin projects plan to back their tokens with real estate and baskets of metals respectively. Another Swiss start-up, Forctis, also has designs on producing a stable coin.\nInitial Coin Offering\nSwiss start-ups choose a new way of doing business\nSwiss start-up are opting for a new financing method - the Initial Coin Offering.\n Business\nSee in other languages: 3\nNeuer Inhalt\nHorizontal Line\nswissinfo EN\nThe following content is sourced from external partners.

They are mining ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô, or cryptocurrencies, and helping them succeed (think ‚Äòmoon‚Äô and ‚Äòlambo‚Äô) is the newly launched mining program, VCloud Mining . VCloud Mining is a bitcoin mining program based on hosted technology, and unlike competition, has introduced just the features that both new and experienced miners would love.\nDigital currencies such as Bitcoin are ‚Äòmined‚Äô, not physically, but by using computing power (called hash rate) to solve complex mathematical problems. Bitcoin cloud mining is a legal activity, and is the other alternative to buying and trading cryptocurrencies. Since it is practically worthless today to use desktops and graphics cards to mine Bitcoin, investors and crypto fans use hosted mining services such as VCloud Mining, where they can buy hash power, rent equipment and see their dollars convert into digital gold.\nVCloud Mining has introduced some novel features to make bitcoin mining even more enticing and profitable. Instead of renting, investors actually own the mining hardware and chips, thus keeping full control. The mining platform is open 24/7, and offers a life-time contract, unlike one or two year contracts offered elsewhere. All hardware is maintained and kept in the US in optimal working conditions for maximum performance.\n‚Äú The profitability of mining depends on hash power, and VCloud Mining offers a global mining pool that works on more power so as to mine more Bitcoins at a faster rate. All Bitcoin rewards are distributed daily into the investor‚Äôs wallet ,‚Äù said a spokesperson for VCloud Mining.\nThe lifetime, open ended contract offered by VCloud Mining gives investors ownership of ASIC chips at a specified hash rate. Rewards continue to be delivered as long as mining stays profitable, and investors have the option of getting the ASIC hardware shipped to them by paying a s/h fee.\nVCloud Mining has also included MLM marketing into its platform, and the Bitcoin Affiliate program partners earn recurring commissions for bringing in new clients without having to invest.\nAs a brand new company, VCloud Mining is looking forward to a period of scaling up, co-locating its mining hardware at other places around the world. There is a free sign up, and plenty of choices for miners and investors when it comes to attractive deals and packages, ranging from a free affiliate account to the life-time Platinum package.\nFor full reviews and step by step videos, please visit: http://vcloudminingreview.com\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: VCloud Mining Review Inc\nContact Person: Jean Smith\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 2154572869\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://vcloudminingreview.com/\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:26:05.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a30992f834ad698ff9b19460f2021b26c99aa31b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUWBNqaav77Sj.n0v0lwW8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why China banned bitcoinÔºü", "title_full": "Why China banned bitcoinÔºü", "published": "2018-05-15T18:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.71, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a30992f834ad698ff9b19460f2021b26c99aa31b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUWBNqaav77Sj.n0v0lwW8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mohor", "published": "2018-05-15T18:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why China banned bitcoinÔºü", "text": "This is due to the fact Bitcoin is in a war with China's economic method, with China's accession to the SDR, China's RMB internationalization strategy has been completely promoted.

product lead at Coinbase, pose Monday, May 14, 2018 in their temporary offices in the Chicago Loop. (Chris Walker/Chicago Tribune/TNS) Chris Walker Save\nCHICAGO - Coinbase, a digital currency exchange based in San Francisco, has opened a Chicago office to be close to burgeoning digital currency markets, big investors and what its leaders say is a vast pool of local talent.\nThe appetite for bitcoin and other digital currencies has grown exponentially in recent years as they've gained legitimacy across the world. And while digital currency is still not widely used or understood by many average consumers, Chicago's two main exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, became the first traditional exchanges to trade the financial products late last year, lending credibility to bitcoin and its lesser-known digital brethren.\nCoinbase is already one of the largest digital currency exchanges around the world. Coinbase's Chicago office will serve as a central hub for some back-office technology behind the company's products, said Paul Bauerschmidt, a former CME executive, who is leading the Chicago office.\n\"It's similar to an exchange that you'd see with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) or CME or CBOE,\" he said.\nRecruiting people who are able to build and maintain these complicated systems, especially with financial experience, is difficult in other cities, Bauerschmidt said.\n\"The talent that's here in Chicago, you can't find anywhere else,\" he said. \"And especially getting as many of the key staff as we need. It's really exciting to be able to build it here.\"\nThe Chicago office also will focus on courting institutional investors, which manage assets on others' behalf, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds or pension funds, Bauerschmidt said.\nIn concert with the Chicago launch, Coinbase is unveiling Coinbase Prime, a collection of tools and services specifically for those institutional investors. The products make it easier for these large investors to start trading and manage sophisticated trading systems, Bauerschmidt said.\nThe Chicago office currently has just six employees, but it plans to get that number up to 30 this year and reach 100 within three years.\nBitcoin's initial trading value was just pennies in 2010, surging to more than $17,000 at one point in late 2017. It's now trading at just under $9,000. At this point last year, a single bitcoin was worth about $1,800; two years ago it was $445.\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as an alternative to government-issued currency. A number of big companies accept it, from travel website Expedia.com to Subway sandwich shops and even online dating site OkCupid. But because it isn't regulated by a country or other single entity like traditional currency, the price can be volatile.\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Love", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samantha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek groothuis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bomkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul bauerschmidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris walker save chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago board options exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago tribune", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago loop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:54:18.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35848d0fb7b4b838be21855c54c625e630908165", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKC0YisvZIY0Ao_GojZlYAkqejLMGUJtXDPX9.x4Q.VNVKUg_hmNKaC_M9tQIwPPIyv7oQGZVp2A--", "site_full": "www.cbronline.com", "site": "cbronline.com", "site_section": "http://www.cbronline.com/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "tech", "finance"], "section_title": "Computer Business Review", "title": "Cybercriminals Bitten by the Bitcoin Bug: What is the State of Cryptocurrencies Within Cybercrime in 2018?", "title_full": "Cybercriminals Bitten by the Bitcoin Bug: What is the State of Cryptocurrencies Within Cybercrime in 2018?", "published": "2018-05-15T18:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cbronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cryptocurrency-3401786_960_720.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35848d0fb7b4b838be21855c54c625e630908165", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKC0YisvZIY0Ao_GojZlYAkqejLMGUJtXDPX9.x4Q.VNVKUg_hmNKaC_M9tQIwPPIyv7oQGZVp2A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T18:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cybercriminals Bitten by the Bitcoin Bug: What is the State of Cryptocurrencies Within Cybercrime in 2018?", "text": "Add to favorites\nWhat‚Äôs the outlook for cryptocurrencies and cybercrime in 2018?\nThe world of cryptocurrencies has sent investors and businesses on a rollercoaster journey over the last couple of years; seeing Bitcoin boom, industry experts slate the currencies and the London Block Exchange take on new cryptocurrencies. In a constant changing environment, how do cryptocurrencies now hold up in 2018?\nRyan Kalember, Senior Vice President of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint, delves into what to expect in the year ahead. What kinds of attacks is Proofpoint seeing?\n‚ÄúCybercriminals continue to follow the money. Over the last several months, the money has been in cryptocurrency and actors are turning their attention to a variety of illicit means to obtain both Bitcoins and alternatives. In addition to the North Korea linked Lazarus Group‚Äôs recent campaigns , we helped uncover a crypto mining botnet that had made as much as $3.6 million in Monero cryptocurrency by infecting Windows servers. Ryan Kalember, SVP of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint,\nLast year was also a record year for email phishing in general and we saw an increase in messages aimed at cryptocurrency users. Anyone with a digital wallet or account on a cryptocurrency exchange could be in the crosshairs. These attacks often attempt to steal wallet IDs and credentials that allow actors to conduct fraudulent transactions with third parties or withdraw funds directly.\nWe have also seen fraudulent cryptocurrency landing pages that are extremely difficult to distinguish from legitimate sites. In one case, the criminals even went so far as to add app store icons that linked to the real blockchain application.\nAs cryptocurrency adoption grows, so too will cybercriminals‚Äô preference in using the currency. As a result, we predict a continuation in phishing attacks that target cryptocurrency wallets and services, as well as an increase in cryptomining malware.‚Äù Why do cybercriminals like to steal cryptocurrency?\n‚ÄúCryptocurrency is a very tempting target for theft because most underground services are paid using bitcoins, Monero, and other altcoins. Cybercriminals are also savvy with cryptocurrencies and have more untraceable spending options when they use digital currency. You will often hear security professionals refer to Monero as the dark web‚Äôs chosen currency. This is because Monero features a stronger focus on privacy than some other cryptocurrencies, and can still be effectively mined outside of a purpose-built server farm.\nHowever, the volatile fluctuation of cyptocurrency values, particularly that of Bitcoin in recent months, has meant we have observed a shift in cybercriminals use of bitcoin in ransomware attacks. In the last quarter of 2017, we saw a 73% drop in ransom payment demands denominated in bitcoin. When demanding money to unlock a victim‚Äôs data, cybercriminals are now more likely to simply ask for a figure in US dollars, or a local currency, than specify a sum of Bitcoin. Are we going to see more activity of this nature?\n‚ÄúYes, cryptocurrency will continue to be a premium attack target because of the potential gain to hacking the system. Unfortunately, the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes fraud even harder to detect. The very features of cryptocurrency that make it so popular (largely anonymous and difficult to trace transactions not controlled by any government or financial institution) make it equally appealing to thieves.\nBitcoins, and other cryptocurrencies, are like cash in a wallet. Much easier to steal if you have access to the wallet, impossible to recover, and much less likely to be detected. The mainstream interest in cryptocurrency is driving advances in malware and new approaches to phishing and cybercrime. By the end of 2017, many campaigns were beginning to include coin miner modules in addition to the primary malware payloads.‚Äù What should cryptocurrency consumers do to better protect themselves from these crypto intrusions, and what should organisations be doing to protect their employees?\nThe greatest threat to individuals and businesses when it comes to the security of cryptocurrency comes in the form of criminals‚Äô usage of social engineering and exploiting what we call ‚Äòthe human factor‚Äô. Consumers should guard their credentials carefully and be vigilant for typosquatted domains (web addresses with subtle spelling errors) and unexpected notifications from wallet and exchange services. When in doubt, always contact the service through their established email address. More importantly, online wallets and exchanges should never be considered trusted storage for cryptocurrencies.\nProofpoint‚Äôs 2018 Human Factor Report revealed that 95% of observed web-based attacks incorporated social engineering to trick users into installing malware rather than relying on exploits with short shelf lives. Therefore, organisations must combine robust security technology with the training of employees to be vigilant and spot attacks that use social engineering through email, social media, and on websites‚Äîeven those seemingly tied to well-known brands or current events. Using phishing simulations (fake attacks that test use real-world tactics) can shed light on where the human vulnerabilities lie in an organisation, and paired with awareness training and technology, these simulations can reduce the impact of real attacks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://webmaster.yandex.ru/vocabularies/", "https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/human-factor-2018", "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/smominru-monero-mining-botnet-making-millions-operators", "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/north-korea-bitten-bitcoin-bug-financially-motivated-campaigns-reveal-new"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan kalember", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lazarus group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "svp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proofpoint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T11:24:13.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0c2428fd7848727ae59ab34cd8c9676451e6eaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSySgBa8VB7FTBT2VV_ouZ52P2_JXctsDN_mMECSQA3YOqVkweY2kxylDSyi3FhUMB3c.Rd5OxLvJaCRGgO3yOtj8LZ52urzxM-", "site_full": "nedugist.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://nedugist.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Nedugist blog", "title": "Bitcoin Could Emerge As A ‚ÄòThreat‚Äô To US Dollar In Future, Suggests St. Louis Fed Chief", "title_full": "Bitcoin Could Emerge As A ‚ÄòThreat‚Äô To US Dollar In Future, Suggests St. Louis Fed Chief", "published": "2018-05-15T18:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0c2428fd7848727ae59ab34cd8c9676451e6eaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSySgBa8VB7FTBT2VV_ouZ52P2_JXctsDN_mMECSQA3YOqVkweY2kxylDSyi3FhUMB3c.Rd5OxLvJaCRGgO3yOtj8LZ52urzxM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nedugist (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T18:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Could Emerge As A ‚ÄòThreat‚Äô To US Dollar In Future, Suggests St. Louis Fed Chief", "text": "\nA top US policy maker made mostly positive remarks about Bitcoin, also not ruling it out as a potential ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to the US dollar, in an interview with CNBC Monday, May 14. Speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the Consensus 2018 conference in New York Monday, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard also identified positive aspects of cryptocurrency, namely revolving around cutting costs in trade. He stated that crypto is ‚Äúfacilitating trade that would not otherwise occur. Some of that‚Äôs illegal, but some of that is avoiding costs that would otherwise be there.‚Äù Asked whether Bitcoin was a threat to the US dollar, Bullard voiced uncertainty about the potential competition the leading cryptocurrency could pose, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so at this point [...]. We don‚Äôt know how the future‚Äôs going to unfold.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy idea is that there‚Äôs a lot of currency competition going on right now,‚Äù Bullard meanwhile continued on the topic of dollar supremacy, adding:\n‚ÄúThe dollar has been the winner historically because it‚Äôs backed by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy in terms of low inflation and that‚Äôs going to be tough to beat. But a lot of people here want to beat it.‚Äù On the topic of blockchain, Bullard was much more openly bullish, saying: ‚Äúwe think blockchain technology is very interesting [..] we want to be very engaged and thoughtful as this proceeds.‚Äù He also responded to a question of whether or not the Fed was considering issuing its own cryptocurrency, saying noncommittally, ‚Äúwe can certainly look at that as a possibility. And there are different parts of the Fed that look at all kinds of applications of blockchain technology. But I wouldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs any plan at this point. The comments continue the trend of general crypto support from the St. Louis Fed.

Appearing on CNBC‚Äôs Fast Money, the former Citigroup and Deutsche Bank executive also spoke on volatility and the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. Bitcoin at $50,000\nWhen asked to give a bitcoin price prediction, Hayes said it could reach $50,000 before the end of 2018. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market has endured a difficult start to 2018 with bitcoin, in particular, dropping to below $6,000 in February after having almost broken the $20,000 ceiling in mid-December 2017. Commenting on the seriousness of his prediction, Hayes said:\nIt‚Äôs my job to make predictions. Whether they‚Äôre right or wrong, it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat has on many occasions this year predicted that bitcoin will be $20,000 by the middle of the year and will round up 2018 trading at $25,000. BitMEX: Highest Bitcoin Trading by Volume\nBitMEX is based in Hong Kong and has a large trading base in North Asia. The platform also holds the record for the most number of bitcoins traded in a 24-hour trading period at 140 BTC. BitMEX offers bitcoin futures and swaps as well as altcoin futures for Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. One of the headline features of the platform is that it offers 100x leveraged trading, which according to Hayes is hardly ever used by traders. It‚Äôs a headline number. Most traders do not use a 100x leverage. Some traders use it as a testing ground or a free option. It is a limited liability from the perspective of the trader. On BitMEX, traders can only lose what they put in. Asian Crypto Trading Dominance\nHayes also spoke about the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. This is because there is an established digital asset trading tradition in the region.\nAsia dominates cryptos because they‚Äôre very used to digital trading assets. South Korea has been trading digital goods related to gaming for two decades. When you move to a purely money based digital currency, they understand that culturally, so they get on board quickly.

Rather, anyone who wants to move their bitcoin to the sidechain needs the approval of a ‚Äòfederation‚Äô group of third parties.\nStill, the miner support, RSK Labs co-founder Gabriel Kurman contends, is rather impactful as it shows support for a concept heralded as a way to expand bitcoin‚Äôs functionality.\nHe told CoinDesk:\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a major announcement for bitcoin as a whole. This 10 percent is coming from 80 percent of the total mining pool power.‚Äù\nAnd, although there‚Äôs a small fraction of the entire network currently securing the sidechain, about 80 percent of miners have already committed support in the future.\n‚ÄúThe hash power percentage is set to increase significantly over the next months,‚Äù Kurman added.\nIt makes sense, after all, because the sidechain is designed to be ‚Äúmerged-mined‚Äù‚Äì a process which allows miners to get transaction fees by contributing their hash power to the sidechain, all while using the same equipment, electricity and power they‚Äôre already using to mine bitcoin.\n‚ÄúRSK has massive support from the mining ecosystem because it adds a new revenue stream for them,‚Äù Kurman said. RSK‚Äôs lightning\nNot only that, but RSK has developed the sidechain to be able to handle more transactions than bitcoin can currently.\nThe RSK sidechain uses what the company calls ‚Äúsmart bitcoins,‚Äù a separate version of bitcoin with the smart contract capability, and that allows for improved scalability.\n‚ÄúOn RSK you can process smart bitcoins at 100 transactions per second,‚Äù Kurman said, pointing to the ‚Äúcompression‚Äù technology RSK pioneered that decreases the total amount of data that must be stored on the blockchain.\nEven with that improvement, though, Kurman is quick to note that that‚Äôs not nearly enough to bring this technology to the masses, acknowledging that the sidechain still deals with the scalability issues faced by many of today‚Äôs blockchains. But the team is working towards that.\nTaking inspiration from developers working on both bitcoin and ethereum, who have been developing technologies called the lightning network and Raiden network, respectively, RSK has been building a similar technology.\nCalled ‚ÄúLumino,‚Äù the project is what Kurman describes as a ‚Äúcombination‚Äù of these two networks so that it can work with RSK‚Äôs unique sidechains technology.\nKurman said he believes the finishing touches won‚Äôt take long, telling CoinDesk:\n‚ÄúBefore the end of the year, we hope to launch the Lumino network, which will allow for 20,000 transactions per second.‚Äù Growing the family\nThe last announcement from RSK today is that two companies are now joining the ‚ÄúRSK family,‚Äù Kurman said.\nThe first is the Inter-American Development Bank, with an Argentinian bitcoin NGO, seeks to promote financial inclusion in Buenos Aires. The NGO has been working to use RSK for the past two years, although Kurman did not elaborate on how exactly the business plans to use the network.\nThe second company building on top of RSK is the BitGive Foundation, a long-standing bitcoin-focused charity organization that‚Äôs been used to funnel bitcoin donations to Nepalese citizens affected by a devastating earthquake in 2015, among other initiatives.\nSpeaking to the BitGive‚Äôs interest in using the RSK sidechain, Kurman said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a project that allows donors to have transparency using smart contracts.‚Äù\nHe added that these new partners display that more and more businesses are starting to see the benefits of bitcoin (and beyond), and as such, are adopting the technology.\nRSK will be demoing all this functionality at their booth at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2018 conference in New York City this week.\nStickers image via RSK\nSmart ContractsBitcoinLightning NetworkRSKMinersRaiden networkConsensus 2018 Ngu·ªìn: S∆∞u t·∫ßm For more okchances with coins, click here 2018-05-15", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gabriel kurman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rsk labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:46:08.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c786ae17c20d4203bf1b93d61852b79a6cb9706", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aEDzFtmxWxK1mZM08sk_IOR69Pl39MDbxuozUw7iEKcXl6IEQoFayTACOoWwm6VE-", "site_full": "www.pinoyden.com.ph", "site": "pinoyden.com.ph", "site_section": "http://www.pinoyden.com.ph/index.php?board=102.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Jobs - PINOYDEN", "title": "NEW BITCOIN MINING TRY FOR FREE", "title_full": "NEW BITCOIN MINING TRY FOR FREE - PINOYDEN", "published": "2018-05-15T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c786ae17c20d4203bf1b93d61852b79a6cb9706", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aEDzFtmxWxK1mZM08sk_IOR69Pl39MDbxuozUw7iEKcXl6IEQoFayTACOoWwm6VE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "frex267", "published": "2018-05-15T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "NEW BITCOIN MINING TRY FOR FREE", "text": "FIRST OF ALL KUNG WALA PA KAYONG COINS.PH ACCOUNT\nSign up: Here referral code j2sf4u para magkaroon ka ng P50 after registration.\nAfter Registration Verified your Account: Phone, Email-Add, Selfie & Upload ID\nNote: Dapat everified mo yung account mo sa coins.ph para magkaroon ka ng P50 using my refferal code.\nBITCOIN MINING\nWebsite \"TypeHash\" offer Bitcoin Mining using your browser - No Downloads!

But that hedging strategy has suffered a major setback after the Zimbabwean central bank ordered finance houses to stop processing virtual currency payments and gave then a two-month ultimatum to put this into effect.\nThe announcement has thrown the country‚Äôs leading crypto currency exchange platform, Golix , into disarray. It has halted its planned token sale to raise $32 million under an initial coin offering (ICO) aimed at generating funds to expand across Africa.\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which is battling to plug foreign currency shortages as foreign shareholders fail to remit dividends back home, says bitcoin trade is risky and could have destabilizing effects on the financial system. This is in stark contrast to the central bank‚Äôs call for the adoption of digital payment platforms as one of the measures to curtail the debilitating effects of foreign currency shortages inflicted by low productivity and a shortage of foreign direct investment inflows.\nConstitutional and law expert, Advocate Fadzai Mahere, said on Tuesday that the ‚Äúlegality of the ban is doubtful‚Äù. This comes as other crypto currency exchange platforms and bitcoin traders in India, which has also banned banks from processing virtual currency payments, are dragging the Reserve Bank of India to the courts . It is largely expected that traders and exchange platforms in Zimbabwe will take this route as they scramble for answers and to save a digital trade that had started to garner public interest.\n‚ÄúThe ban appears not to be based on any law or regulation, not to mention that it seems not to be reasonable, proportionate or fair,‚Äù Mahere said on Twitter .\nThe blanket ban by the reserve bank of Zimbabwe has left traders and those who used bitcoin for various payments in a tailspin. Bitcoin was now being used for airline payments, software payments, and pre-owned vehicle purchases from Japan and for sending forex out of the country. Many are hoping that the central bank, which has been accused of printing more local notes and coins to buy forex from parallel markets, will back down from its position.\nBitcoin was so crucial to the transactions for business people in Zimbabwe that due to the illiquidity of the market, the value of bitcoin reached record highs about six months to year ago, with a nominal value higher than in more developed markets.\nAs traders and investors in crypto currency look for a way round ban, Golix is engaged with regulators with a view to convince them it adheres to ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù and due diligence tenets. The exchange platform has explained to bitcoin traders in Zimbabwe that they will ‚Äúwill not be able to send or receive fiat currencies for crypto currency trades because of the ban.\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief ‚Äî the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world's bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China's push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR and Jennifer Hughes; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang, Alun John and Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Edwina Gibbs)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canaan creative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T04:09:27.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95436cd3f345ff4b5d1c624cfabac51f25529b71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHUmprfmuwCiVVGorb_GD1iQYNQSvswGyZobdg3IcY9MeFIpTwqPYIMLJz4pdDeu0nBCVIiZJP.4e_r1iVx8nQDdnCNJ_BWHqTW0mhMh.fnZXDwpFuyY8SewjiJ0ybH3o-", "site_full": "vpnwp.com", "site": "vpnwp.com", "site_section": "https://vpnwp.com/feed", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "VpnWP", "title": "ICO Cryptian ‚Äì ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "title_full": "ICO Cryptian ‚Äì ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "published": "2018-05-15T17:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/vpnwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/no-image1.gif?resize=400%2C330&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95436cd3f345ff4b5d1c624cfabac51f25529b71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHUmprfmuwCiVVGorb_GD1iQYNQSvswGyZobdg3IcY9MeFIpTwqPYIMLJz4pdDeu0nBCVIiZJP.4e_r1iVx8nQDdnCNJ_BWHqTW0mhMh.fnZXDwpFuyY8SewjiJ0ybH3o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "danroo", "published": "2018-05-15T17:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "ICO Cryptian ‚Äì ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "text": "Home / Template / ICO Cryptian ‚Äì ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) ICO Cryptian ‚Äì ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) danroo 3 mins ago Template Comments Off on ICO Cryptian ‚Äì ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) 3 Views\nRight here Presenting ICO Cryptian the perfect touchdown web page for each ICO startups, ICO Company, Bitcoin, Mining ,digital Crypto Forex funding web site , blockchain.Digital curency tracker ,Cryptocurrency buying and selling Web site.

Richard Malone, Sprott Money :\nIn an apparent about-face, Wall Street firms are now warming up to Bitcoin. After months of scrutinyand denouncement from prominent figures in finance, such as Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet, Bitcoin seems to have achieved a level of relevance with some institutional players.\nYesterday, The New York Times published a report that the New York Stock Exchange‚Äôs parent company, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), is planning a Bitcoin exchange of its own. The platform would enable big investors to buy, hold, and sell the digital currency with swap contracts. If the plans were to come to fruition, the initiative could represent a massive shift in Wall Street‚Äôs perception of Bitcoin, as this will be the first direct trading operation launched by a traditional financial market.\nThe news comes a mere five days after Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street‚Äôs banking behemoths, revealed plans for opening Bitcoin derivatives to its clients.\nHowever, Goldman Sachs and ICE are not the only Wall Street establishments throwing their hats into Bitcoin‚Äôs ring. Back in December, the CME Group launched Bitcoin futures contracts, establishing the the cryptocurrency‚Äôs first financial derivatives. Nasdaq, the second largest securities exchange in the world (behind the NYSE), recently announced its intent to implement a cryptocurrency exchange if the regulatory issues around the asset class get resolved.\nWhether this newfound acceptance is beneficial for the currency is up for serious debate. People in favor of mass adoption believe widespread recognition will help people gain access to a decentralized economy unaffected by the whims of centralized governments. Detractors, on the other hand, think this adoption will further centralize the currency, directly contradicting Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized ethos.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sprottmoney.com/Blog/nyse-parent-company-plans-on-bringing-bitcoin-to-wall-street-nyt-report-richard-malone-14-052018.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sprott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard malone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dece", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:07:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22f1a8b477ace503ff8f4b345f0ed59aaa40e7fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__35vSvVIpbi1BLYwSQgEXDMcLHWosZuOAN.l1aaxSvGjos37EBicILkzMdWFFqltDQQ--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Will See $50,000 By End of 2018, Says BitMEX CEO", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Will See $50,000 By End of 2018, Says BitMEX CEO", "published": "2018-05-15T17:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22f1a8b477ace503ff8f4b345f0ed59aaa40e7fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__35vSvVIpbi1BLYwSQgEXDMcLHWosZuOAN.l1aaxSvGjos37EBicILkzMdWFFqltDQQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T17:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Will See $50,000 By End of 2018, Says BitMEX CEO", "text": "Home ¬ª bitcoin ¬ª bitcoinist ¬ª crypto ¬ª news ¬ª Bitcoin Price Will See $50,000 By End of 2018, Says BitMEX CEO Bitcoin Price Will See $50,000 By End of 2018, Says BitMEX CEO bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nArthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMEX, predicts that bitcoin will reach the $50,000 mark by the end of this year.

Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market has endured a difficult start to 2018 with bitcoin, in particular, dropping to below $6,000 in February after having almost broken the $20,000 ceiling in mid-December 2017. Commenting on the seriousness of his prediction, Hayes said:\nIt‚Äôs my job to make predictions. Whether they‚Äôre right or wrong, it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat has on many occasions this year predicted that bitcoin will be $20,000 by the middle of the year and will round up 2018 trading at $25,000. BitMEX: Highest Bitcoin Trading by Volume\nBitMEX is based in Hong Kong and has a large trading base in North Asia. The platform also holds the record for the most number of bitcoins traded in a 24-hour trading period at 140 BTC. BitMEX offers bitcoin futures and swaps as well as altcoin futures for Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. One of the headline features of the platform is that it offers 100x leveraged trading, which according to Hayes is hardly ever used by traders. It‚Äôs a headline number. Most traders do not use a 100x leverage. Some traders use it as a testing ground or a free option. It is a limited liability from the perspective of the trader. On BitMEX, traders can only lose what they put in. Asian Crypto Trading Dominance\nHayes also spoke about the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. This is because there is an established digital asset trading tradition in the region.\nAsia dominates cryptos because they‚Äôre very used to digital trading assets. South Korea has been trading digital goods related to gaming for two decades. When you move to a purely money based digital currency, they understand that culturally, so they get on board quickly. Did you see my ride today at #Consensus2018 ? pic.twitter.com/qGznsNMgWo\n‚Äî Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 14, 2018\nHayes is one of the participants at this year‚Äôs Consensus Conference taking place in New York. He took to Twitter on Monday to share a photo of the rented orange Lamborghini Huracan he purportedly arrived in at the summit.\nWill bitcoin hit the $50,000 milestone in 2018? Will the entry of Institutional American investors challenge the Asian retail trading dominance in the crypto space?

Appearing on CNBC‚Äôs Fast Money, the former Citigroup and Deutsche Bank executive also spoke on volatility and the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. Bitcoin at $50,000\nWhen asked to give a bitcoin price prediction, Hayes said it could reach $50,000 before the end of 2018. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market has endured a difficult start to 2018 with bitcoin, in particular, dropping to below $6,000 in February after having almost broken the $20,000 ceiling in mid-December 2017. Commenting on the seriousness of his prediction, Hayes said:\nIt‚Äôs my job to make predictions. Whether they‚Äôre right or wrong, it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat has on many occasions this year predicted that bitcoin will be $20,000 by the middle of the year and will round up 2018 trading at $25,000. BitMEX: Highest Bitcoin Trading by Volume\nBitMEX is based in Hong Kong and has a large trading base in North Asia. The platform also holds the record for the most number of bitcoins traded in a 24-hour trading period at 140 BTC. BitMEX offers bitcoin futures and swaps as well as altcoin futures for Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. One of the headline features of the platform is that it offers 100x leveraged trading, which according to Hayes is hardly ever used by traders.\nIt‚Äôs a headline number. Most traders do not use a 100x leverage. Some traders use it as a testing ground or a free option. It is a limited liability from the perspective of the trader. On BitMEX, traders can only lose what they put in. Asian Crypto Trading Dominance\nHayes also spoke about the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. This is because there is an established digital asset trading tradition in the region.\nAsia dominates cryptos because they‚Äôre very used to digital trading assets. South Korea has been trading digital goods related to gaming for two decades. When you move to a purely money based digital currency, they understand that culturally, so they get on board quickly.

May 15, 2018\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies considered as securities or a mode of payment has been the most heated debate in the entire crypto community and in the world as more and more regulators try to define it.\nThere are a few concurrent stories right now that hinge on this. The SEC has recently come forward and stated that it could, in the near future, start calling few of the cryptocurrencies as securities given their nature. This would create legal issues for companies and their founders.\nAnyway, if the SEC does end up classing them as securities it could cause some extreme volatility in the crypto market, even more than usual.\nFor any new entity to be classified as a security it has to be subjected to the usual laws and regulations regarding traditional financial assets. Meaning, it needs to be registered with the authorities according to the laws already set in place and be taxable as such. Any individual who has gained profits in cryptocurrencies, and converted those profits into cash, could be liable to pay taxes on those profits.\nAny new exchange-traded fund like the one that the Winklevoss twins have just secured a patent for will be classified a security.\nCryptocurrencies are very different than the existing securities. It is a brand new asset class and the coins themselves will likely require new sets of rules that are more versatile and designed to encompass this new technology.\nWe live in a world which is moderately diversified allowing the laws to be different in every country. The Regulatory body of Switzerland has actually set an excellent precedent in their ICO guidelines, which breaks down the cryptocurrency classification into three different categories: Payment tokens Utility tokens Asset tokens\nBitcoin can be categorized as payment token as it is designed to be a means of payment and store of value. Classic examples of Utility Tokens are Ethereum and Ripple‚Äôs XRP. Their design enables them to interact with their respective blockchains in order to provide access/payment to an application or service within the network.\nAsset Tokens which are more like Securities, give the token holder the right to partial ownership of the company or foundation. This allows it to present itself with a share of the company or voting rights in the company.\nThe ETH tokens on the Ethereum network enables voting, but the act of holding the token itself does not give the HODLer the right to influence the network‚Äôs actions. Ripple‚Äôs token known as XRP is under the control of a private company called Ripple Labs and XRP holders are not entitled to any piece of that company.\nThe SEC considered the original DAO tokens in 2016 as securities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:34:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2dbd7c8e5c1e1d140ce3f5d24e7d93358d2a51da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOifb7u0w5RBOpq3e9a_mLvqnXg_6iki3qEVlx.HTWRg2Q_lLLmNDqyge.yB4UsUMrpnuP4t_79.0JfAxMVyH9A5lLBPHvfGSRSAARwV6p3j1f", "site_full": "www.free-power-point-templates.com", "site": "free-power-point-templates.com", "site_section": "http://www.free-power-point-templates.com/feed", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "Free PowerPoint Templates", "title": "Free Bitcoin Presentation Template Background", "title_full": "Free Bitcoin Presentation Template Background", "published": "2018-05-15T17:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.free-power-point-templates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/160521-bitcoin-template-4x3-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10156, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2dbd7c8e5c1e1d140ce3f5d24e7d93358d2a51da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOifb7u0w5RBOpq3e9a_mLvqnXg_6iki3qEVlx.HTWRg2Q_lLLmNDqyge.yB4UsUMrpnuP4t_79.0JfAxMVyH9A5lLBPHvfGSRSAARwV6p3j1f", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sumaira", "published": "2018-05-15T17:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free Bitcoin Presentation Template Background", "text": "Free PowerPoint Templates Topic Business / Finance Free Bitcoin Presentation Template Background Free Bitcoin Presentation Template Background An outstanding bitcoin background design for PowerPoint presentation Advertisement\nNowadays almost every new business is running with Internet money that is in great use.

His most striking statement: ‚ÄúBitcoin is a threat to the US Dollar‚Äù.\nJames Bullard is a leading politician and one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve presidents of the United States. He expressed in the Interview that Bitcoin is a non-negative ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to the US Dollar. On the question of whether Bitcoin as a threat to the US Dollar, said Bullard, although initially reluctant, but then said (freely translated):\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that Bitcoin is currently a competitor. We do not know how the future will develop. My observation is that there is currently a strong competition. The Dollar was historically the winner, because he was supported by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy and low Inflation, and that will be hard to beat. But a lot of people here want to defeat.‚Äú\nOn the subject of Blockchain Bullard was very open and said: ‚ÄúWe think that the Blockchain technology is very interesting. We want to be very active in this area.‚Äú\nOn the question of whether the FED will issue its own digital currency ‚Äì the ‚ÄúFedCoin‚Äù said Bullard, that the FED is examining all options, and there are certainly groups within the FED, the exploring the possibilities and the Blockchain technology with regard to all types of applications to investigate. Currently, there is his testimony, according to but no active Plan is a ‚ÄúFedCoin‚Äù. In his opinion, by the output of a digital Central Bank currency is not imminent benefits would arise.\nThe statements by James Bullard reflect in General the findings from the study published in January, the Central Bank of St. Louis. As we report, said the FED St. Louis at the time very positive about crypto-currencies and Bitcoin. Thestudy focused, among other things, such as the Bitcoin, in the current money system is classified and whether it is for Central banks is the point of a crypto currency. The researchers came in January already to the conclusion that no serious Central Bank has a sufficiently high incentive for crypto-currencies, because of the logistical effort for KYC (Know your customer) and AML (‚ÄúAnti money laundering‚Äù) and the risks of a crypto-currency are too high.\nWhether all the American Central banks or Central banks in other countries share the opinion of Bullard, however, it remains to be seen. As we reported, said Antony Lewis, R3 Director for Research, Cash and CBDC strategy at a conference in April that he believed that in the course of this year, a Central Bank-backed digital currency could be issued. At the end of March Jessel Lund IBM had announced that the company has been working for a long time, with Central banks to digital currency projects, and the Launch of a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) in a timely manner.\nDisclaimer: ‚Äî trading in crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

What do you hope for?\nAnd what if we tell you the most of the mixers on the market today are not anonymous at all and that it is not efficient to use them with the expectation of anonymity for your crypto assets.\nLet's discuss it from the very beginning.\nAfter the closure of one of the most well-known mixer plenty of cloned mixers have been founded speculating on its past popularity to find their place in the market. Although the owner of the closed mixer urged everyone forward to forget about anonymity so perhaps there were reasons for that.\nThe comparative analysis of most mixers in the market today obviously showed that all of them, except for a few, are exactly the same. And do they give anonymity to the cryptocurrency that they promise? The answer is negative! There is no aim to offend anyone but it is reality.\nWe are a team of developers who are worried about anonymity in the network including the anonymity of the cryptocurrency. Before you try to use our for sure best mixer, since its name speaks for itself - BESTMIXER.IO (yes, we are very modest guys), we suggest you first of all to try a very useful utility CAE-check. CAE, or ¬ë–°oin Anonymisation Event¬í-check, will verify the level of your cryptocurrencies (currently bitcoin) anonymity.\n*** Just enter into the CAE-check the address where the coins were sent from to your usual bitcoin mixer, and it will show you the receiving address(es). The probability that your receiving address(es) will be determined is very high - more than 95% (provided that all transactions have already been made and confirmed). If you've ever mixed your bitcoins using the best known mixers at the moment you urgently need to check if CAE-check knows about this mix. In case of positive answer we advise you to use BESTMIXER.IO urgently to make your coins mixed in a proper way.\nWe named the anonymous mixing process - CAE and anyone who has ever used other mixers is highly recommended to carry out this procedure with BESTMIXER.IO.\n*** - Almost all mixers with a vulnerability we found, fixed their systems.\nCoinmixer.se, Bitmix.biz, Privcoin.io - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3140140.msg33958885#msg33958885\nCryptomixer.io - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3140140.msg34021863#msg34021863\nCoinmixer.se (2 addresses) - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3140140.msg34081331#msg34081331\nOur resources are very limited and nevertheless one of the results of our work is the CAE-check utility. Meanwhile, a huge number of companies that have spent a lot of money on algorithms for transactions searching are engaged in analysis of blockchain, for example: BlockSeer, ChainAlysis, ScoreChain, etc.\nDo you still suppose the traditional mixers will provide you with the level of anonymity for your transactions that suits you? Unfortunately, not!\nStart using BESTMIXER.IO right now.\nWe are aware this statement sounds rather harsh and expect a large number of questions, both of a routine nature and from people who are aggressive for various reasons.\nIn advance We present our apologies for possible minor bugs in the project since our project is on beta testing period now and actually very young. Our team consists of not a thousand people and we will need some time to answer all your questions and suggestions at the first stage of our cooperation with you.\nAbout all the advantages of the project we tried to tell on the pages of our website.

In the past, we‚Äôve seen a ton of typical malware running EXE files in plain sight with very easy removal steps and no sophistication whatsoever. This is very different . Couple of disclosures first: This is original research. There are many reports of these infections, and AV companies like ESET , Webroot, and Symantac do have solutions to these problems. Some of them actually work, too! What I have not been able to find on the net is the actual source code to the miner. Read on. We have the source code. I am posting this at the bottom of this article in an altered form that cannot be re-used for malicious purposes. The code is very readable and sheds a lot of light on how sophisticated these attacks have become. After extracting the source code, I did lots of online searches and found an excellent whitepaper written about this specific malware . It‚Äôs written in Turkish. I can‚Äôt read Turkish but I can paste text into Google Translate very well. Turkish 101 optional. It‚Äôs pretty clear to see what the researcher was trying to communicate here. IP addresses, port numbers and DNS names listed in a nice, coherent table. The IP addresses disclosed are real and wildly reported as malicious. Locating these addresses is key in regaining control over the infected machine. These might be different for your specific infection. This isn‚Äôt really a Bitcoin miner as CPU mining of Bitcoin is no longer feasible. ‚ÄòMonero‚Äô is being used here but in reality this is of no importance as command and control center is capable of sending instructions to switch to whichever crypto they want. Finding the Problem Normally you‚Äôd look for an EXE file that is causing excessive resource consumption and attack it from there. Good luck doing that when the file is powershell.exe. You could just disable PowerShell altogether. This may be an OK workaround on a workstation, but If you‚Äôre on an Exchange server or a DC this will literally break everything under the sun. And in case you‚Äôre wondering, changing PS Execution Policy AFTER you‚Äôve been infected does nothing. As usual ‚Äúprocexp64‚Äù from Sysinternals is your first weapon of choice. We‚Äôre going to do 2 things with it: Identify what code is actually running (since there is no EXE, how can you tell?) Enumerate the TCP connections and block them later on. This is annoyingly time consuming but it works. The first picture above prints out the commands being used to mine; the output is very sparse though, and you can tell right away variables are being chained and obfuscated using text encoding. Take a look at that big red arrow in the screenshot, looks familiar? Long story short Powershell has the ability to parse Base64 encoding and a few clicks later we have insight into everything the software is up to. Source Code Link Source Code posted here is provided for reference. It has been modified and key parts removed to prevent this malware from being re-used. Parsing the Source Code Number 1 priority is to cut off network access to the command&control system. This is important because the command and control can issue any instructions to your server. If the attacker gets tired of mining crypto currency with your servers, they could very easily set off a ransomware infection. Or just delete all your files. Number 2 priority is to cut off network access to the ‚Äòmining pool‚Äô. Mining in itself isn‚Äôt harmful to your systems in any way, it merely consumes LOTS of resources which in turn is crowding out legitimate windows processes and causing them to crash. Number 3 priority is actually removing the infection. This will have to be a future blog post as it is an adventure in itself.

Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part . Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.\nBenefits for merchants\nThere are many benefits accepting Bitcoin as payment if you are a merchant. First is that the processing fees are paid by the sender, and the merchant pays nothing to receive funds. These fees are considerably lower than traditional payment networks.\nBenefits for buyers\nThere are many benefits for buyers when it comes to using Bitcoin. It allows fast confirmation time within 10 minutes, which is handy for international transactions. It allows you to purchase items from abroad without worrying about currency conversation. Storage of coins is not difficult. The transaction fee is paid by the sender of the coins but this is typically pennies.\nEscrow services\nEscrow services have resulted in increased online safety for Bitcoin transactions for buyers. These are typically a trusted third party, or more recently multi-signature 2-of-3 wallets. The buyer and seller each hold one key to the wallet and a neutral trusted third party holds a third key. If there is a dispute, this person can mediate and either give their key to the buyer to return their funds, or the seller to give them their funds to their own wallet.\nFuture of Bitcoin in commerce\nBitcoin due to its decentralized nature has the potential to revolutionize commerce and enable transactions across international borders with ease. It allows the sending of transactions for a fraction of the cost of major payment networks and there are no ongoing costs for having a Bitcoin wallet. This is an advantage for both buyers and merchants. It has the potential to help connect buyers and merchants across the globe and with the use of multi-signature escrow services might help reduce fraud in some areas. Use of Bitcoin in general can eliminate chargeback fraud for a merchant. But this can also pose a problem for buyers who are in genuine need of a chargeback.\nPotential Drawbacks\nThere are some potential drawbacks for using Bitcoin as a payment system. Some of these are being improved at the time of writing. They include the following:\nRisk of fraud without escrow services, with no recourse.\nUntil the block size limitation is fixed, transactions may be slow to confirm during times of high demand.\nUnable to chargeback if there is a genuine need.\nNot yet fully understood by tax authorities in some countries.\nStill an emerging technology and volatile in price, not accepted by most merchants universally.\nConclusion\nThis has covered the main benefits of using Bitcoin as a payment system. It is worth accepting for merchants and buyers alike. It is likely to change E-Commerce space as it gains traction, and adopting it early for very little cost is a good move for businesses and buyers alike.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T17:07:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a6b1d666fa344f1813a436ca96dbfc501ea87d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQIyx5pxdL_ffwDThEbLpSY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How long Bitcoin can survive in cryptocurency industry ?", "title_full": "How long Bitcoin can survive in cryptocurency industry ?", "published": "2018-05-15T17:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.769, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a6b1d666fa344f1813a436ca96dbfc501ea87d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQIyx5pxdL_ffwDThEbLpSY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "princeyeboah", "published": "2018-05-15T17:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "How long Bitcoin can survive in cryptocurency industry ?", "text": "I can easily predict that if authorities find out the way to regulate the whole cryptocurrency market they will start using it for the purpose of making profit, for example by means of taxation etc. then there will be set of laws accepted to make regulations even more official.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:46:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fad7e8898e7581c790f2ee249cf916217c2c872", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFu7qWIBGGScVyZIfywv8qEM7nkldXbG6eNn2Pnjim8os8LuUQQEjqQoaWw0UMkXCLOP3JewDAx1GYNOVqWTyZKaa0uUNMSuyUttTry6nNI7xgOlGzf5SvLj8cqjPkY_BCQ--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Research firm Tabb predicts institutional money begins purchasing bitcoin this year.", "title_full": "Research firm Tabb predicts institutional money begins purchasing bitcoin this year.", "published": "2018-05-15T17:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Research-firm-Tabb-predicts-institutional-money-begins-purchasing-bitcoin-this-year.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fad7e8898e7581c790f2ee249cf916217c2c872", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFu7qWIBGGScVyZIfywv8qEM7nkldXbG6eNn2Pnjim8os8LuUQQEjqQoaWw0UMkXCLOP3JewDAx1GYNOVqWTyZKaa0uUNMSuyUttTry6nNI7xgOlGzf5SvLj8cqjPkY_BCQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T17:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Research firm Tabb predicts institutional money begins purchasing bitcoin this year.", "text": " Research firm Tabb predicts institutional money begins purchasing bitcoin this year.\nThis is the year that institutional money will come into the cryptocurrency market, thanks to the development of trading infrastructure, Tabb Group said Tuesday.‚ÄúIf 2017 was the year cryptocurrencies went mainstream, then 2018 is certainly shaping up to be the year they go institutional,‚Äù the capital markets research and consulting firm said in a report by senior analyst Monica Summerville and colleagues.
