Bitcoin wallets can bet tied to the exchange with bets placed between the wallet and the online bookmaker. Most of the major cryptocurrency exchanges discourage betting transactions directly with bookmaker or online gambling site, thus making the wallet setup most ideal .

Wallets are typically more secure for storage purposes.\nThe African nation of Kenya, which encompasses one of the world's largest sports betting markets, will also now have access to the Golix Exchange.\nOne will probably need a few days to set up the cryptocurrency accounts as most exchanges require a verification process for security purposes. The Bitcoin.com wallet is relatively easy to download and set up, however.\nThough based out of Zimbabwe, Golix has faced a crackdown by that nation.\nIn a statement quoted by News Day, Golix head of growth, Panashe Tapera, noted that moving outside the country was part of a new strategy ‚Äì the trading platform plans to expand operations across the entire continent. Tapera said:\n\"As part of our strategy, starting from Friday, June 1, people in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda will be able to start trading from Golix.

It might be tempting to take this breather as a sign of the tide turning. We highlight the reasons why you probably shouldn‚Äôt.\nIn the last couple of days, Bitcoin has gone up a bit. This has brought questions if the current move is only a correction within a decline or already an important sign of a shift in the market. In an article on CoinDesk, we read :\nBitcoin looks primed for a move to $8,000, but low trading volumes point to the risk of a bull trap.\nThe cryptocurrency broke through a key descending trendline (drawn through the May 6 high to the May 21 high) on Sunday, adding credence to last Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and signaling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.\nHowever, at the same time, daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion ‚Äì down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion.\nLow volume is a cause for concern for the bulls, as it is widely considered a sign that the market is approaching a peak; that is, the rally will be short-lived.\nWe have a slightly different take on whether Bitcoin is set to move above $8,000 ‚Äì the currency might shoot up above this level but we haven‚Äôt really seen enough signs that this is the case just yet. Other than than, we generally support the conclusions of the cited couple of paragraphs.\nBitcoin is up and it went above the declining resistance line but this line might have just turned out to stop the appreciation. The declining volume seems to be a classic bearish indication. And we might see a daily close below this line today, which would be bearish as well. We still think that a move up can‚Äôt be ruled out but the move down we‚Äôve seen today weakens the recent bullish signs.\nAny Important Bullish Implications?\n(Click to enlarge)\nOn BitStamp, we see the recent move up and the depreciation of today. The appreciation of the last couple of days brought Bitcoin above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level and this is a slightly bullish indication. Only slightly, because this particular level is not an extremely important one.\nA more bullish indication is the breakout above the declining resistance line based on recent tops. This indicates that the move up might be stronger than the preceding ones but the fact that Bitcoin turned South today and is now closer to this level weakens the bullish implications slightly. Related: The Stock Market Is Defying A Strong Jobs Report\nHave we seen very important bullish indications, though? Not really. Bitcoin is still below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and the action hasn‚Äôt really changed the short-term outlook. And this is only for the short term, without really considering the bigger picture into account.\nVerification in Disguise\n(Click to enlarge)\nOn the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see the depreciation from $10,000 and the recent appreciation in perspective. In particular, the recent move up does seem like a correction within a larger decline. This is further reinforced by the long-term declining trend line . It might be the case that today‚Äôs move down is a bounce back down off this line.\nAdditionally, we see that in spite of the recent move up, we haven‚Äôt really seen a move above the 78.6% retracement level based on the rally to the all-time high around $20,000/ Actually, it rather seems that we might have seen a verification of the breakdown below this level. This is a bearish indication, at least for the longer term.\nThe current situation is quite curious in terms of the price action. We are seeing a move up on relatively low volume followed by one day of depreciation and the current environment looks like the late stage of a short-term correction within a long-term decline. This means that, in our opinion, the situation is still bearish and we might see a stronger move to the downside in the next couple of weeks.\nSumming up, the decline might resume and become even deeper.\nBy Mike McAra via Sunshineprofits.com\nMore Top Reads From Safehaven.com:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/long-term-investments/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/fibonacci-retracement-gold-silver/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-trend/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-low-volume-breakout-could-be-a-bull-trap/", "https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-resistance-level/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike mcara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:02:34.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d2fcbc34e52118892c6859d98d17ac84d5ece9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkIQt01x3Mm2Vz8nVAKz5dw1tfhivYDm1VxlIc8l7uT.klU_4JGQurpOZoYkMZh0RexobE1tZ4gFk-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/live/allmarketssummit", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto", "title": "Magic Number?

Those who came on board in the early going are very happy that they did because the value of their coins has risen astronomically. That doesn‚Äôt do a lot of good for the people in the here and now who are trying to decide whether it is still a smart move to get involved with Bitcoin.\nOn the one hand, there is the possibility that the coins continue to muscle out cash and credit cards as forms of payment, which will allow Bitcoin to be the dominant entity in the world of individual finance. Yet there is also the potential for all its momentum to be squelched by the threat of regulatory bodies trying to destroy it. IMAGE: PIXABAY\nAs an investor looking for clues about whether you should buy into a specific asset, you would normally look to the past performance of that asset as a solid indicator of where its price might be headed in the future. But Bitcoin makes this prospect difficult because you run into the statistical conundrum known as small sample size.\nIf all of this seems too complex for you as an investor, you should think about turning control over the artificial intelligence contained in a trading program such as Bitcoin Code . As for what small sample size is and how you can counteract it when it comes to Bitcoin, here is a brief primer. 1. Definition\nSmall sample size can loosely be defined as a set of statistics that is too minimal to have any legitimate predictive value. As an example, imagine a person who manages to throw a ball through a hoop once in two attempts. It is too small a sample size to say that they will then be able to throw the ball through the hoop half the time. But if the person throws the ball through the hoop 100 times out of 200 throws, it becomes a much safer assumption to say that they will indeed be able to throw the ball through the hoop half the time, as they have proven this to be the case with all the preceding throws. 2. How It Relates To Bitcoin\nWhen you are dealing with stocks that have been around for decades, you can safely look at past results as a predictor for when it‚Äôs right time to buy or sell that stock. But Bitcoin has only been around for a short period of time. And much of that time has been spent in a precipitous rise in value. Now that the price has leveled off a bit, there isn‚Äôt much to go on going forward. 3. The Solution\nThe best way to solve this problem with Bitcoin is the buy and hold method. This will allow you to ignore all the ups and downs that are coming until a reliable sample size forms. You can judge at that point whether it is worth going forward with Bitcoin or selling.\nBitcoin is a tricky statistical problem for investors . Wait until that sample size increases before you make any bold predictions.\n cryptocurrency- PIXABAY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Now some news-points from bitcoin world are claiming this price plunge was planned. Check following links:\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/after-the-boss-calls-bitcoin-a-fraud-jp-morgan-buys-the-dip/\nhttp://btc-flow.in/2017/09/16/after-the-boss-calls-bitcoin-a-fraud-jp-morgan-buys-the-dip/\nhttp://btc-flow.in/2017/09/16/after-the-boss-calls-bitcoin-a-fraud-jp-morgan-buys-the-dip/\nNow without going into whether above claims are true or not, my concern is \"Isn't this is the right time to enter the bitcoin market or purchase few more\". There is definite signs of improvement in the bitcoin price market. Current price is around $3757. It is quite possible to see bitcoin back to 4k to 5k or more. Given biggest players from finance sector are eying this lucrative market.\nWhat do you think, is this is right time to buy some more bitcoins or wait and watch?\nLet¬ís back September 2017. You are right that is the best time to enter the world of bitcoin. If we remember the value, last September bitcoin cost is around $4,000, and last December reach the value an amount of $13,00. Let¬ís do the math. After three months you earn the amount of $9,000, and if we divide into days, you can make $97 per day Not bad. If we only have a time machine, I will back at September ends.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations":

The landmark judgment Occurred on May 30, 2018, and it repeals the decision made by one of the nation‚Äôs lower courts in a case dating back to last year. In Sept 2017, the Suwon District Court billed 33 years old Ahn with the selling and distribution of child porn. Operating a site since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235, 000 obscene files. Though the court given Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in jail for his actions, it didn‚Äôt confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the pornography.\nIn accordance with the court, the authorities couldn‚Äôt grab Ahn‚Äôs bitcoins because, as opposed to other assets tied to illegal dealings, they are not tangible. It‚Äôs not suitable to confiscate bitcoins because they‚Äôre in the shape of electronic files without physical things, unlike cash, the court ruled. Virtual currency can‚Äôt assume an objective standard value. ,Now, the country‚Äôs Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court‚Äôs decision was appealed, and, upon being contested in South Korea‚Äôs highest court, it did not hold up. Seeing as Ahn accrued his electronic fortune in exchange for illegal company, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it‚Äôs lawful for the authorities to confiscate it.\nKorean legislation provides that the captured hidden asset ranges from money, stocks, deposits, along with other types of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value, the judgment from this Tuesday reads. Bitcoin is subjective and comes in the shape of digitized files, but it‚Äôs traded on a market and may be utilized to purchase goods. Consequently, receiving bitcoins is a means of taking profits. ,Ahn‚Äôs sentence will remain the same, however, he will have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth approximately $1.4 million in press time along with a few $654, 000 in cash. Tracking Ahn‚Äôs transactions on Bitcoin‚Äôs book, the court was able to determine just how many bitcoins he received as payment.\nObtained bitcoins by providing a particular bitcoin address to porn watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain demonstrated that bitcoins delivered to him ought to be seen as profits online, the court judgment countries. The judgment is a critical, if roundabout, reference for the legal status of cryptocurrency in the nation. It gives digital assets such as bitcoin improved validity at a time when the South Korean is also in the process of legalizing and regulating First Coin Offerings. After effecting a national ban on ICOs in Sept of last year, the South Korea government has approached the cryptocurrency sector with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday‚Äôs judgment and the outlook of an official framework for token sales, nevertheless, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.\nSources:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ahn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asset  south korea‚Äôs supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suwon district court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T23:20:35.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d67dfc14bae5952474ecdd6de168df6e5c8eb15d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHKu.9_W4KYSVc8oL1o.pOU.a_vpDLW4bQSBSwpqI2d4G2V84NcCOqbOpfFmdRxTDZSdw35xoeSyCltYWVNLTwG6", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness ‚Äì Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Former NBA Commissioner David Stern Backs Sports Streaming ICO", "title_full": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Former NBA Commissioner David Stern Backs Sports Streaming ICO", "published": "2018-06-05T21:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-Former-NBA-Commissioner-David-Stern-Backs-Sports-Streaming-ICO.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d67dfc14bae5952474ecdd6de168df6e5c8eb15d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHKu.9_W4KYSVc8oL1o.pOU.a_vpDLW4bQSBSwpqI2d4G2V84NcCOqbOpfFmdRxTDZSdw35xoeSyCltYWVNLTwG6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-06-05T21:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Former NBA Commissioner David Stern Backs Sports Streaming ICO", "text": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Former NBA Commissioner David Stern Backs Sports Streaming ICO 5 June 2018 8532\nGet exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nIt‚Äôs now clear what it takes for a former NBA Commissioner to emerge from retirment. David Stern, who was at the helm of the league for three decades starting in the 1980s, has now thrown his weight ‚Äî and capital ‚Äî behind blockchain-fueled streaming sports startup SportsCastr, which is behind a new cryptocurrency dubbed FanChain. Former NBA Commissioner David Stern Backs Sports Streaming ICO\nStern‚Äôs views on the cryptocurrency market have evolved from believing it to be comparable to ‚Äútulipmania‚Äù to respect for decentralized technology, and now he‚Äôs backing an initial coin offering (ICO) startup with an ERC-20 token.\n‚ÄúI then came to understand that blockchain technology had much to offer with respect to a range of transactions in many different industries, like the sports sector,‚Äù Stern told Forbes of his gradual embrace of this emerging industry.\nStern‚Äôs interest in cryptocurrencies isn‚Äôt shocking considering his tech savviness. He is a proponent for legal sports betting and has touted the capabilities such as mobile-fueled sports gambling ushered into the industry by his peers. He wasn‚Äôt always on board with sports betting, but as with cryptocurrencies, his position evolved over time.\nWhen Stern left the court in 2014, he was credited for the success of the NBA and its multi-billion dollar annual profits. Under his tenure, not only did the value of the league balloon but so did player salaries and franchise price tags, leading to multi-year television deals and NBA fever among fans across the globe. If Stern is able to influence investors and participants for FanChain in the way he was able to do for the league, the blockchain startup is in for a wild ride.\nStern isn‚Äôt the sole investor, and the roster of backers extends to some of his peers from the professional sports industry, including NFL player Vernon Davis, Syracuse University Head Coach Jim Boeheim, retired NBA all-star Steve Smith and others. FanChain Disrupter Jim Boeheim and other notable sports personalities have invested in the ICO alongside Stern. | Source: US Government/Flickr\nFanChain is looking to solve the problem of sports media being one-sided, and it‚Äôs designed to appeal to the sports broadcaster in everyone. It lets users who are watching sporting events not only select which sports commentary they choose to listen to but also participate by providing their own live streaming video sports commentary ‚Äî including a half-time show, for instance.\nThese announcers are rewarded with digital tokens, which fuel the FanChain ecosystem that is comprised of a FanWallet, digital goods, subscriptions and more. FanChain says that it puts the power of the play-by-play in the hands of the fans and gives them a chance to share in the value.\nFanChain is launching a private token sale shortly followed by a public crowdsale planned for this summer, according to Forbes.

Ran Neu-Ner, the famous CNBC anchor, presented the talk show which had four other speakers along with David.\nDavid began the talk show by explaining use case for the XRP token. Ripple sees XRP as a settlement asset for international cross-currency payments. Instead of having to use any correspondent banking system and without any cost involved, the international transfers can be executed within 5-6 seconds.\nHe also mentioned that XRP ledger provides all the characteristics of the decentralized system in a different way than Bitcoin does, it is not vulnerable to problems like a majority attack and has a higher transaction rate.\nFurther, Ran raised a question about the future of Bitcoin [BTC].\n‚ÄúIs Bitcoin at the risk of becoming obsolete?‚Äù\nDavid thinks that Bitcoin has to find a new use case, considering all the controversy that had occurred earlier regarding Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\nDavid says:\n‚Äú Lightning Network is a game changer because Bitcoins challenges to find a use case and a use case of store of value . Bitcoin has some limitations making it not a very good means of exchange, just because of the transaction volume it can handle while Bitcoin Cash can handle more transactions on chain.‚Äù\nHe also mentioned that it is very hard to predict small level details, just because we do not know how Bitcoin is going to evolve.\nDavid also shared his views on how cryptocurrencies such as XRP is different from today‚Äôs digitized assets.\nThe digital asset transfer makes a transformational difference by transferring the actual value instead of the fiat currencies. Digital asset transfers have made the exchange of money from various parts of the world very simple. According to David, one of the hardest things to achieve in the blockchain industry use cases that are focussed on settling payments.\nHe says:\n‚Äú It is easy to adjust numbers around, but the problem is, the problem is now you have left a mess because you haven‚Äôt moved the actual value‚Äù\nThe lack of accountability is the main difference between blockchain transactions and fiat currency transactions.\nA Twitterati named Crypto Dan says:\n‚Äú I love listening to @JoelKatz .

According to its promoters, Money Trade Coin (MTC) ‚Äúprovides a safer, more secure and superior alternative of storing wealth in the form of digital currency, to investors as well as commoners.‚Äù Investigators, however, accuse it of being a front for an international fraud, misleading investors with promises of high returns, real estate and foreign passports.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Wozniak Wants Bitcoin to Rule World New Age Cryptocurrency\nOn its website MTC is described as intellectual property jointly owned by Dubai based firm Bitcoin Global FZE, UAE and Money Trade Coin Ltd, UK. And Mr. Amit M. Lakhanpal is said to be the Director of Money Trade Coin Ltd (and one of the key members of Bitcoin Global FZE and MD of Flintstone Group, India). While two people were detained on Monday, Lakhanpal is reportedly still at large and the police believe he may have fled India.\nFlintstone‚Äôs Thane office reportedly had twenty employees, while another office in the Mumbai suburb of Vikhroli had a staff of fifty. The investigation started after a local businessman complained that he and his colleagues were not able to get a response from the company about their invested funds. Police, Bollywood and Politicians\nThe police said Lakhanpal‚Äôs office showcased photos of him with ‚Äúleading political personalities‚Äù used to impress his alleged victims. Additionally, ‚ÄúHe may have even invested in a Bollywood film featuring a major male star, but we are verifying this.‚Äù A senior officer even told the Hindustan Times that some members of the police were allegedly involved with MTC and their involvement is being investigated.\n‚ÄúPal and his associates promised investors a 20-times return on investment in a mere six months. But once the deadline passed, the company made several excused to not release the money,‚Äù the officer said. ‚ÄúA few days ago, some investors even went to Dubai to meet Lakhanpal, but they were allegedly threatened, and were told that they should not ask for their money. We also found that Lakhanpal had never constructed any building, even though he claimed to run a real estate company.‚Äù\nWhat do you think is the true story behind MTC?

Craig Wright Urges Bitcoin Cash Miners to Process 0 sat/B Transactions Advertisement Get exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nA new initiative seeks to convince bitcoin cash miners to remove the dust limit and being processing a limited number of zero-fee transactions in every block, and it has backing from several high-profile individuals.\nAnnounced on Tuesday by nChain Group and CoinGeek , the so-called ‚ÄúMiner‚Äôs Choice‚Äù initiative asks miners to eliminate the current BCH dust limit, which stipulates the minimum transaction size that they will mine and include in blocks.\nAt present, standard bitcoin cash software clients have a dust limit of 546 satoshis (0. 546 BCH), which has an approximate USD value of six-tenths of one cent. CoinGeek and nChain said that their mining firms will begin allowing users to make transactions as small as 1 satoshi ($0.000011377).\nAdditionally, the two firms said that they will begin including an unspecified number of zero-fee transactions in blocks that they mine, rather than requiring all users to pay a transaction fee of at least 1 satoshi per byte.\nRequiring users to pay a transaction fee helps prevent spam from clogging up the blockchain and incentivizes them to make payments more efficiently.\nHowever, CoinGeek and nChain said that removing a fee requirement will make BCH useful for microtransactions, as well as create a ‚Äúhealthy competitive fee marketplace‚Äù among miners.\n‚ÄúUsers will have more choice about how much (if anything) they wish to pay for sending a BCH transaction, depending on the speed they want. If a user wants an instant transaction, the user can choose from a range of small fees made offered by miners. But if a user is willing to wait perhaps 30-40 minutes for a transaction to be added to a block, the user can elect zero fee.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis fosters a healthy competitive fee marketplace among miners, which will keep fees low for users and support Bitcoin Cash growth,‚Äù the companies added.‚Äù\nCraig Wright, chief scientist of nChain, said on Twitter that adopting these measures will ‚Äúspur adoption‚Äù of bitcoin cash, while CoinGeek founder Calvin Ayre said that his company was doing its ‚Äúpart to bring economic freedom and utility to the world.‚Äù Miners should start thinking about no dust limit and some zero fee txs to spur adoption faster.\nSingle satoshi tokens.\n‚Äî Dr Craig S Wright (@ProfFaustus) June 4, 2018\nWright further argued that removing the dust limit would hasten the development of ‚Äú colored coins ‚Äù for bitcoin cash, as transfers of these tokens could be encoded in 1 satoshi transactions.\n‚ÄúPlan for the long term,‚Äù he concluded.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1003528039681191938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "craig wright", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nchain group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T21:49:42.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3764294f71e0fa1c0faf2be77ae7f2a9424237a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipVbhjob5wd5I3tXdhTp3Cbc___VkgSYVrZuQ5HESsU_c5taUsReIZe4hhFcKh.KzH2EJxz6IQADJwtE4tQ0.ushnkJ7hJZk87Bdo06tLpcr3Cb1GwbP.XC6CChl126JUwQ7pdIGnf_tI-", "site_full": "www.asit.com.es", "site": "asit.com.es", "site_section": "http://www.asit.com.es/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News As It Comes!", "title": "Bitcoin price FALLS: BTC dies for the 300th time- what does it mean?

at 6:28 pm Enforcement Directorate grills Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra in Bitcoin scam 0 Share\nThe Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday questioned Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a money laundering probe related to a bitcoin transactions case, officials said.\nThe businessman was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said.\nThere are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating.\nThe ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin , its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nIt is alleged that nearly 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments.\nIt is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state.\nLast year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies.\nThe government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

questions Raj Kundra for over 9 hours as witness in bitcoin case ED questions Raj Kundra for over 9 hours as witness in bitcoin case June 05, 2018 23:19 IST\nThe Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday questioned Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, for more than nine hours as a ‚Äúwitness‚Äù in connection with a money laundering probe related to bitcoin transactions case in Maharashtra, officials said.\nThe businessman was summoned at the ED‚Äôs office and was asked questions about the purported links of the alleged main accused of the case Amit Bhardwaj with his businesses.\nThey said Kundra was questioned for over nine hours and his statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\nComing out from the agency‚Äôs office, Kundra told waiting reporters that he was called as a ‚Äúwitness‚Äù in the case as Bhardwaj, the alleged kingpin of the case, was unsuccessful in investing in a poker league promoted by him.\nOfficials added that Kundra‚Äôs statement would be that of a witness in the case.\nKundra soon tweeted to reiterate his statement.\n‚ÄúDear Media thanks for your breaking news across the country. I have given you all bytes outside the ED office where I was called as a witness to give evidence.\n‚ÄúThe accused (Amit Bhardwaj) was to buy a team in my league which didn‚Äôt happen due to non payment. Thank you,‚Äù he said.\nOfficials said they had come across these links and hence, Kundra, chairman of Viaan Industries, was asked to depose and record his statement.\nThe Enforcement Directorate had registered a criminal case under the PMLA against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nIt is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi in April.\nBhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures such as GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments.\nIt is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state.\nLast year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there were no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the Reserve Bank of India had not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies.\nThe government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they were like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection. ¬© Copyright 2018 PTI.

currency", "text": "Steve Jobs was known as a dreamer more than an innovator, yet the most credit for the rise of Apple during its early days should be given to the true creator of the personal computer, Steve Wozniak.

Bitmain Antminer S9\nFor comparison, the popular Bitmain Antminer S9‚Äôs hashrate is 14TH/s. According to Bloomberg, the GMO chips are designed in Japan and produced in Taiwan.\nMasatoshi Kumagai, Chairman and Director of GMO Internet and the GMO Group representative, described the advantages of his company‚Äôs mining equipment over other products.\n‚ÄúThe performance per unit is higher than that of major competitors‚Äô products,‚Äù he was quoted by the news outlet. ‚ÄúIf we switch from over 20,000 mining machines operating in Northern Europe to GMO miner B2, the installation space will be about half in terms of equivalent performance.‚Äù Power Consumption\n‚ÄúCompared to general mining machines‚Ä¶the power consumption is up to 20%, the cost of network equipment etc. can be reduced to 1/55,‚Äù Itmedia noted.\nKumai publication reported from the press conference that each unit consumes 1,950 watts and power supply units can supply up to 2,200 watts at 240 V. Adjustable Price ‚Äì $1,999 for June\nGMO miner B2 will be sold through the company‚Äôs subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland, according to Nikkei. They will be on sale starting Wednesday and orders will start shipping from the end of October, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.\nThe price for each unit is ‚Äúannounced monthly,‚Äù the publication added, revealing that the ‚Äúsales price in June is $1,999.‚Äù Itmedia described:\nThe price for the June release is $1,999 (including power supply unit, excluding tax). The sales price is adjusted monthly according to demand etc. The number of shipments was kept private.\nCurrently, Bitmain‚Äôs Antminer S9 is priced at $837. GMO‚Äôs Plans\nMr. Masatoshi Kumagai told reporters that so far the crypto mining industry is dominated ‚Äúby mining machines provided by Bitmain, a major mining hardware company in China,‚Äù and that he ‚Äúnoticed the fact that not a single Japanese company that is good at manufacturing is able to participate.‚Äù\nHe also revealed that the company ‚Äúinvested nearly 10 billion yen for the development of the product,‚Äù the publication conveyed and quoted the chairman explaining:\nWe are not setting business targets such as sales targets yet, but if we cannot sell it, we will use it in our mining business, so I think that it is a very excellent business in that there is no inventory risk.\nFurthermore, he added, ‚Äúwe also provide an API (application programming interface) for system monitoring compatible with GMO miner B2 and a detection function [for] when the product is connected to the net at the time of an unlikely event of theft.‚Äù\nWhat do you think of GMO miner B2? Will you buy one? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, Nikkei, Itmedia, Kumai, and GMO Internet.\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

Brad Garlinghouse said that although BTC cannot compete with XRP in terms of transfer times and costs, it was undoubtedly a store of value. Advertisements Garlinghouse: XRP and BTC Aren‚Äôt in Competition with Each Other\nBrad Garlinghouse was speaking to CNBC at the Money 2020 conference that is being held in Amsterdam this week. The Ripple CEO said that he felt that different cryptocurrencies weren‚Äôt necessarily in competition with one another. ‚ÄúSpecializations of different kinds of ledgers‚Äù would allow different blockchains to find their own niches.\nFor Garlinghouse, Bitcoin cannot compete with XRP as a means of transfer. With XRP transfers taking seconds and Bitcoin‚Äôs taking considerably longer, the executive feels that his own company offers better utility in this niche.\nHowever, that doesn‚Äôt mean that Bitcoin is the useless old relic that some altcoin aficionados claim it to be. Garlinghouse admits that it is proving an effective store of value:\n‚ÄúI think it [Bitcoin] is a store of value. We as a world have decided to store value to the tune of about $130 billion‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a store of value. It‚Äôs hard to argue that.‚Äù\nThe Ripple CEO next addressed some of the other projects in the cryptocurrency space. He mentioned that some initial coin offerings (ICOs) were not even clear about the problem that they addressed. For this reason, he remains sceptical about them retaining any value in the future.\nGarlinghouse then turned his attention to an issue facing Ripple ‚Äì the pending lawsuit against the company. Last month, Ryan Coffee filed a suit in California regarding supposed securities law violations. The plaintiff had lost money through trading XRP. He alleges that the team behind Ripple earned millions by selling the tokens they had gifted themselves when they created the platform.\nGarlinghouse dismissed the case as ‚Äòoutrageous,‚Äô claiming that the XRP token had enough utility to not be deemed a security. He went on to call Coffee ‚Äòsomebody who held XRP for‚Ä¶ two weeks‚Ä¶ and is making some claims.‚Äô The CEO concluded:\n‚ÄúWhether or not XRP is a security is not going to be dictated by one lawsuit‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs very clear that XRP is not a security, it does exist independently of Ripple the company. If Ripple the company is shut down tomorrow the XRP ecosystem would continue to exist. It‚Äôs an independent, open-sourced technology.‚Äù\nFinally, the Ripple CEO was pushed for a price prediction for his network‚Äôs native currency. To this he responded that he didn‚Äôt know how to make such a call and ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt dare try‚Äô anyway.

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn‚Äôt fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price. Advertisements\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‚ÄòIndex‚Äô Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms Bitcoin Cash Is May‚Äôs King of Coins\nThere are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that‚Äôs in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May ‚Äì 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar‚Äôs weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however ‚Äì ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded. Fake Volume Rears Its Head\nWhen it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it‚Äôs likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it‚Äôs likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who‚Äôs responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn't fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium 'Index' Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms\nBitcoin Cash Is May's King of Coins There are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that's in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May ‚Äì 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar's weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however ‚Äì ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded.\nFake Volume Rears Its Head When it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it's likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it's likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who's responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

Though bitcoin has been widely accepted by big financial institutions and traders, the ban on the cryptocurrency advertising in Facebook and Google has recently picked up an issue whereas cryptocurrency experts are speaking out about this matter which might enable the feature again in the future. The price has been ranging for a few days now, which is expected to push higher towards the $8,000 area but with certain retracement and correction along the way. As of the current scenario, the price may push much lower towards the $6,500 area before showing any impulsive bullish momentum in the coming days with target towards the $10,000 area. As the price remains above the $5,000 area with a daily close, the bullish bias is expected to continue further.

He‚Äôs about as eccentric as imagined, defiantly taking on his government through the issuance of a proprietary, local money. It was a way to get out from under gouging state-backed banks. Close to half a decade later, and after a crackdown, his little hamlet is thriving as a result of tapping the digital universe to cure their monetary ills.

I‚Äôm not ready to save the world or even Russia, I want to be comfortable and I want to share this comfort with the community,‚Äù Mikhail Shlyapnikov told CNN Money . The expansion he speaks of revolves around his personal economic odyssey spurred by banking cartels and their double digit interest premiums on access to capital, Russian rubles. Mikhail Shlyapnikov –ö–æ–ª–∏–æÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤–æ (Kolionovo) is little over an hour by car from Moscow. That was just enough space for Mr. Shlyapnikov to hospice a cancer diagnosis. It‚Äôs a farming village, population probably around a couple dozen. It was a chance to escape city life. That was nearly a decade ago, and almost immediately the iconoclast former banker set about changing things. Mr. Shlyapnikov explained, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to suffocate and be a slave of the banks. So I had to invent my own money. And I did it. I‚Äôm my own bank, government, regulator.‚Äù Indeed, around 2010 he led the charge to stop politicians entering the hamlet, insisting they prove mental fitness. Only a few years later, he launched his ‚Äúkolion‚Äù to purposefully usurp the ruble. Crypto‚Äôs Bright Russian Farming Future Kolion in its 2014 iteration was paper. That was all it took for his arrest, as a Russian court deemed kolion illegal about a year later. Spring of last year, undeterred, Mr. Shlyapnikov seized on initial coin offering (ICO) mania, raising half a million dollars. ‚ÄúWe now have about $2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,‚Äù he noted . ‚ÄúThis way we can attract real money into the business.‚Äù The village‚Äôs crypto has 500 bitcoin backing it in reserve, almost $4 million worth. Kolions aren‚Äôt mined, and no fiat is paired with it. Instead, Kolionovoians can earn it through a concept he calls ‚Äòplowing,‚Äô which involves trading labor in exchange. Kolions can also be purchased with other, more established cryptos. His vision has turned out to be fortuitous. Russian economic prospects can be seen as immediately bleak: the country faces growing sanction levies on top of sometime contracting markets. The village and its neighbors, who both are incorporating the crypto into their daily lives more and more, are effectively insulated from wild downturns. Such was not the case only a few short years ago. Is this the model for crypto‚Äôs future? Let us know in the comments. Images via the Pixabay.

Okex‚Äôs New Exchange Traded Tracker (ETT) Okex , the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes. It includes six coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, and OKB) and requires USDT to subscribe. The minimum subscription for the instruments is 100 units. A couple of days ago, we reported that Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on an index of ten assets.

Today the team behind the wallet issued a response to the event, further explaining what happened and detailing the steps taken to prevent its reoccurrence. They say that the attack was carried out by a native Russian speaker, which was able to phish only about $150,000 worth of ether from MEW users. They quote Internet Security experts as explaining that the ‚Äúfinancial resources required for such an attack likely exceeds the amount of funds taken.‚Äù The team added that it is a lack of safety education that led some clients to fall for the fraud. ‚ÄúWe hope that from this experience, every single person who interacts with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will understand how important self-education is.

He‚Äôs about as eccentric as imagined, defiantly taking on his government through the issuance of a proprietary, local money. It was a way to get out from under gouging state-backed banks. Close to half a decade later, and after a crackdown, his little hamlet is thriving as a result of tapping the digital universe to cure their monetary ills.

I‚Äôm not ready to save the world or even Russia, I want to be comfortable and I want to share this comfort with the community,‚Äù Mikhail Shlyapnikov told CNN Money . The expansion he speaks of revolves around his personal economic odyssey spurred by banking cartels and their double digit interest premiums on access to capital, Russian rubles. Mikhail Shlyapnikov –ö–æ–ª–∏–æÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤–æ (Kolionovo) is little over an hour by car from Moscow. That was just enough space for Mr. Shlyapnikov to hospice a cancer diagnosis. It‚Äôs a farming village, population probably around a couple dozen. It was a chance to escape city life. That was nearly a decade ago, and almost immediately the iconoclast former banker set about changing things. Mr. Shlyapnikov explained, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to suffocate and be a slave of the banks. So I had to invent my own money. And I did it. I‚Äôm my own bank, government, regulator.‚Äù Indeed, around 2010 he led the charge to stop politicians entering the hamlet, insisting they prove mental fitness. Only a few years later, he launched his ‚Äúkolion‚Äù to purposefully usurp the ruble. Crypto‚Äôs Bright Russian Farming Future Kolion in its 2014 iteration was paper. That was all it took for his arrest, as a Russian court deemed kolion illegal about a year later. Spring of last year, undeterred, Mr. Shlyapnikov seized on initial coin offering (ICO) mania, raising half a million dollars. ‚ÄúWe now have about $2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,‚Äù he noted . ‚ÄúThis way we can attract real money into the business.‚Äù The village‚Äôs crypto has 500 bitcoin backing it in reserve, almost $4 million worth. Kolions aren‚Äôt mined, and no fiat is paired with it. Instead, Kolionovoians can earn it through a concept he calls ‚Äòplowing,‚Äô which involves trading labor in exchange. Kolions can also be purchased with other, more established cryptos. His vision has turned out to be fortuitous. Russian economic prospects can be seen as immediately bleak: the country faces growing sanction levies on top of sometime contracting markets. The village and its neighbors, who both are incorporating the crypto into their daily lives more and more, are effectively insulated from wild downturns. Such was not the case only a few short years ago. Is this the model for crypto‚Äôs future? Let us know in the comments. Images via the Pixabay.

That is only to be expected, considering how all of the top markets are in the red once again. The Bitcoin Cash price has lost 5.2% over the past 24 hours, which make sit one of the bigger ‚Äúlosers‚Äù in the top fifteen. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline is Very Real It is evident there is a lot of bearish pressure across all of the cryptocurrency markets for some unknown reason. Turning that situation around will not be easy whatsoever, but it seems there will be a lot of positive momentum later this year. That is what the experts expect, at least, but the current Bitcoin Cash price momentum isn‚Äôt exactly all that great. To be more specific, the recent 5.20% Bitcoin Cash price decline shows how some altcoins will continue to suffer more from this bearish momentum compared to Bitcoin. It is not entirely uncommon to see altcoins lose even more value when the Bitcoin price is declining, though. In the case of the Bitcoin Cash price, remaining above $1,000 won‚Äôt prove much of a challenge, but anything above $1,050 may prove to be rather difficult. There is also the decline in the BCH/BTC ratio to keep in mind at all times. Although this decline is less steep than the USD decline for Bitcoin Cash, it isn‚Äôt helping matters much at this stage. Even so, the Bitcoin Cash price is still going through a rough period, and it is very likely that will continue to happen for quite some time to come. Even though BCH maintains a pretty solid interest across markets, its trading volume has dropped to $709.02 million. That in itself is more than sufficient for the time being, albeit it may not necessarily be sufficient to keep the Bitcoin Cash price above $1,050 for much longer. Even so, cryptocurrencies are always unpredictable, and the momentum can change course in the blink of an eye. As of right now, OKEx remains the biggest trading platform for Bitcoin Cash. Its lead over HUobi isn‚Äôt too big, though, and Binance completes the top three. All of these exchanges offer USDT trading, which vastly trumps any pairs related to fiat currencies at this stage. Looking at the bigger picture, the Bitcoin Cash price is doing just fine. The currency is still in the four-digit price range, even though it has dropped well below this threshold on more than one occasion as well. Whether or not the Bitcoin Cash price can remain above $1,050, will be the question that needs to be answered as soon as possible. For now, it seems that will be the case, although nothing has been put in stone just yet. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:34:08.012+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 28808, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=3400", "requestsLeft": 628}
