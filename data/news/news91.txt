It’s the day, 8 years ago, May 22, 2010, when a guy spent 10,000 bitcoins , or $30 worth at the time, on two large Papa John’s pizzas. Today, those bitcoins would be worth $82 million. I hope he got some free extra garlic sauce.\nWell, just in case you haven’t, here’s how the story goes according to Quartz …\nBitcoin was less than two years old when Laszlo Hanyecz decided to spend some of the coins he had mined on some real-world goods. The coins were worth just a fraction of a cent at the time, and no merchant accepted them as a means of payment. So he posted on the main gathering place for bitcoiners at the time, the Bitcointalk forum :\n“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”\nAnother user on the forum decided to take him up on his offer. Smart move.

They have presented it in such a way that the price of Bitcoin will not rise anymore. I think this type of promotion is very negative in the market.\nWell people are can be easily manipulated by big amounts and better wordings that the other ones. Since as of today, bitcoin going on its worst side, they take it as an advantage to utilize it by comparing it to their altcoin or their digital currency. They easily manipulate the minds of the people by stating 'facts' of their own, but some of them fails to achieve their goal which is to surpass bitcoin.

By 2136, today's daily quota of 144 BTC will be reduced to just 0. 168 BTC.\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/qu...-mined-per-day\nOk, so that's a long way off, but to get there the frequency still halves every 4 years. McAfee (a mathematician) worked out that the cost of mining the last BTC would be from several million to several hundred million $$, and for the million or so before that the cost would rise from several hundred thousand $$ to several millions. Quite simply, the value of BTC must by those times justify the risk since mining comes with no guarantee of success. So in order for the last couple of million (only 5 million to go as of 2018) to be mined, the BTC price would need to be astronomical, otherwise they will never be mined. 16 PM #7233 Luigi a cookin' an' a bookin'\nJoin Date Dec 2014 Abuja Posts 16,788 ^ Interesting piece (from March) about the cost of mining one BTC, the profit margin etc. in each country from March 2018.\nhttps://www.financemagnates.com/cryp...tcoin-country/ 18 PM #7234 Luigi a cookin' an' a bookin'\nJoin Date Dec 2014 Abuja Posts 16,788 TRON will today be released on its own blockchain in open beta.

But i believe this will end a good result. What do you think about this ? Your advice will be highly appreciated. Thanks!\nI guess you need to work hard to earn and get back your money that is supposed to be for your school fees.

In just a 12-month period, the combined value of all virtual currencies added together rose from $17.7 billion to roughly $613 billion -- a gain of more than 3,300%. By comparison, it would have taken the stock market decades to generate the returns that virtual coins dished out in just one year.\nThis article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\nWait, bitcoin can go down in value?\nHowever, 2018 has been a completely different story . Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, shed more than half of its value in just a one-month span toward the beginning of the year, and it's struggled to recover ever since.\nWhat's behind bitcoin's struggles, you ask? Part of the blame can be assigned to a step-up in regulation. Investors tend to appreciate the anonymity and unregulated nature of virtual currencies. However, in South Korea, a market that's critical to the success of bitcoin and digital currencies in general, new laws in place require banks to verify the identity of their members before linking their bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. This newfound transparency likely goes a long way to validating bitcoin as an asset, but it's not been viewed as a positive by some within the crypto community.\nBitcoin's woes may also be partially blamed on what I refer to as the proof-of-concept conundrum associated with blockchain technology . Blockchain -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies most cryptocurrencies and is responsible for logging all data in a secure and unchanging manner -- has proven its worth in numerous small-scale projects, but has yet to catch on in the real world. Until businesses are willing to give this technology a shot, and blockchain can demonstrate its ability to scale, it'll remain constrained.\nMore recently, though, legal concerns have held back bitcoin.\nAre traders manipulating the price of bitcoin?\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it was opening up a criminal probe into whether cryptocurrency traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and Ethereum for financial gain. The DOJ will be working side by side with the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which currently handles all derivatives trading tied to bitcoin.\nThe DOJ believes that bitcoin is susceptible to fraud for a number of reasons, as listed by Bloomberg . In particular, regulators question whether cryptocurrency exchanges have adequate measures in place to actively pursue those folks who attempt to cheat the system. They also point to the wild volatility in digital currencies as a lure for cheaters who are looking to manipulate the system. Lastly, the aforementioned lack of regulations could make it considerably easier for traders to move virtual coins like bitcoin.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, regulators are looking into two specific types of manipulation: spoofing and wash-sale trades.\nSpoofing involves a trader, or group of traders, placing an order that creates a new best bid or adds to the perceived liquidity of an asset. Shortly thereafter, the trader(s) will then cancel their initial bid (the spoof) and place a trade on the opposite side of the market. This is done so a trader can sell their stake in an asset, but at an improved sales price thanks to their spoofed bid, which may have offered the perception of downside liquidity and/or support and encouraged other traders to bid up the price of an asset. The same can be done in reverse, with spoofed asks, ultimately allowing the trader(s) to net a more attractive purchase price on an asset.\nOn the other hand, a wash-sale would involve an individual, or group of traders, buying and selling an asset with themselves in the hope of pushing its price higher and giving off the perception of improved liquidity.\nIn this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin sits on US mobile payment company Circle application in Paris, France, Feb. 27, 2018. Photo: Chesnot/Getty Images\nGiven how little regulation surrounds most decentralized crypto exchanges, spoofing and wash-sale trades may very well both be occurring, but we won't have any confirmation on that until the DOJ's investigation wraps up, which could take some time.\nYet another reason to avoid bitcoin\nIt's become pretty evident as time has passed that bitcoin, while being an incredible creator of wealth over the past couple of years, is rife with risk. In addition to potentially being manipulated by cryptocurrency traders, bitcoin's network has slowed to a crawl , relative to its peers.\nAccording to an analysis of transaction speed per second conducted by HowMuch.net, bitcoin peaks at a meager seven transactions per second. By comparison, leading global payments processor Visa can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second using its existing infrastructure.\nBitcoin's block-processing time of approximately 10 minutes also tends to be substantially longer than its peers, resulting in an average validation and settlement time of 78 minutes. Sure, this is still quicker than sending funds across borders using traditional banking networks, but it's substantially slower than practically all of its peers. Though the Lightning Network is supposed to resolve bitcoin's scaling issues, the damage may already be done.\nWhat damage you ask? We've witnessed a small handful of merchants moving away from bitcoin as a medium of exchange due to its slow network. Payment processor Stripe, which was the very first major company to accept bitcoin in 2014, dropped bitcoin as a payment method last month.\nAnd, just to round things out, there aren't any traditional fundamental metrics with which to value bitcoin. Unlike a stock, which has income statements, balance sheets, earnings reports, and management commentary that can be scoured, bitcoin offers nothing more than transaction speed and average daily transaction count, which tell us absolutely nothing about its long-term staying power.\nAs amazing as the gains have been, the writing appears to be on the wall to avoid bitcoin.\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

Bitcoin price volatility is known to be highly significant. It suffers from dramatic short-term price fluctuations conveying downside risk. However, from a long-term perspective, Bitcoin's price is substantially up since early 2017 .\nBitcoin's Long-Term Skyrocketing Trajectory Bitcoin is down considerably since early January 2017. However, if we calm the jitters caused by short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations and focus on the long-term trend, we can see that the cryptocurrency continues to perform spectacularly. As Ran NeuNer recently tweeted, \"Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan. 2017.\"\nBitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan 2017. pic.twitter.com/kxPds6GZUF\n— Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) May 27, 2018\nGranted, if you entered the market after January 2017, this information might not be relevant. Indeed, if you are a short-term cryptocurrency investor, you might be losing money.\nShort-term and long-term investments carry different degrees of risk. Short-term investing carries more downside risk because it more closely resembles gambling.\nOn the other hand, long-term investment involves holding a vehicle for more than a year, or several years. Therefore, early Bitcoin adopters are doing well, even if they have had to suffer long bear market periods, as shown in the chart below.\nFinancial investors advise diversifying. For instance, Edward Jones, Financial Advisor, writes :\nAs an investor, you'll probably need a mix of long-term and short-term vehicles. By knowing the differences between these two categories, you should have a good idea of what to expect from your investments — and this knowledge can help you make those choices that are right for you.\nThe Trend Is Your Friend Certainly, whether Bitcoin's price will continue its ascending trajectory is unknown. Nevertheless, predictions on both sides abound .\nFor example, The Motley Fool predicts that the entrance of institutional investors will be detrimental \"as it introduces their crypto skepticism and deep pockets into the equation.\"\nConversely, others predict that Bitcoin's price will increase precisely because of the entrance of institutional investors. Explaining why \"Bitcoin is a buy despite its continued losses,\" Spencer Bogart, blockchain venture capitalist, declared to CNBC :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they're going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nIndeed, there are as many predictions as predictors. But the truth is that financial markets are unpredictable. Long-term investing is less risky than short-term. And, do not forget that \"the trend is your friend.\"\nDo you think the entrance of financial Institutions into the crypto market will affect Bitcoin's price positively or negatively?

This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be traded on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: Cobinhood, C2CX, Simex, Trade By Trade, GOPAX, OTCBTC, Kraken, DragonEX, Iquant, Gemini, Omicrex, HitBTC, xBTCe, Bibox, Coinsuper, Bithumb, CoinsBank, BitMEX, CoinBene, Coinone, YoBit, Bitfinex, OEX, Hotbit, Huobi, Neraex, Octaex, Luno, fex, Coinroom, Sistemkoin, Bitstamp, Fisco, CEX.IO, Ethfinex, Bitbank, TOPBTC, OOOBTC, RightBTC, Quoine, Coinhub, BCEX, BitForex, Tidex, Paribu, bitFlyer, Exmo, LakeBTC, CoinTiger, OKEx, Bit-Z, IDAX, Coinrail, itBit, Negocie Coins, Upbit, Poloniex, Bittrex, CoinEgg, B2BX, Lbank, EXX, WEX, Livecoin, BTCC, Binance, CoinEx Market, Korbit, Zaif, Fatbtc, BitBay, Gate.io, BTCBOX, GDAX, ZB.COM, BtcTrade.im, Exrates, Kucoin and Bitinka.

I think we all know enough about people that questions will be asked, no matter how detailed explanations in FAQ can be\nYes, those questions will be asked for now. but then they'll go away won't they? In a few months, new users to chipmixer will have no idea that there used to be a gambling feature on it that used to exist. New users currently probably don't either so it does solve the issue. and I do like the donate feature instead of charging a fee as then you can set how much you can actually give them and that you can actually pull out chips as private keys instead of them having to send you the coins as then you get to determine your own fee and the delay you want to use.\nQuote: from: buwaytress on May 30, 2018, 10:13:38 AM The minimum is back to 0.001... but that's not anyway an impact since the betting is completely optional. No one is forced to use it, but it is an additional step to randomize output size. I still think it was a very good, very unique option others didn't have, but if there were a better alternative, I'm all for it.\nI still think a separate gambling site where you get a voucher code or something to input would be a good idea for them tro try to do. Even 7$ is quite steep for an initial bet (it's usually nice to run quuite a few 1 sat bet to check everything's close to fair - at least 30% win chance on x2 bets).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T22:53:27.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a146b686e3764ff4a65af9de74907f8b14e13f96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C21AxndGvTaFga.hi7hJ6TK6wjrDhFTtD02Zfx54jhLShZv9dWQMdku4Bx1nHSc3MHo-", "site_full": "unmodchat.com", "site": "unmodchat.com", "site_section": "http://unmodchat.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=15", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "White Wolf Unmoderated Chat Forum View forum - In-Character Information", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "title_full": "White Wolf Unmoderated Chat Forum View topic - Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "published": "2018-05-30T21:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a146b686e3764ff4a65af9de74907f8b14e13f96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C21AxndGvTaFga.hi7hJ6TK6wjrDhFTtD02Zfx54jhLShZv9dWQMdku4Bx1nHSc3MHo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helenpoich", "published": "2018-05-30T21:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "text": "XEvil 4.0 : NEW top software for SEO/SMM\n1.

Bitcoin price volatility is known to be highly significant. It suffers from dramatic short-term price fluctuations conveying downside risk. However, from a long-term perspective, Bitcoin’s price is substantially up since early 2017 . Bitcoin’s Long-Term Skyrocketing Trajectory\nBitcoin is down considerably since early January 2017. However, if we calm the jitters caused by short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations and focus on the long-term trend, we can see that the cryptocurrency continues to perform spectacularly. As Ran NeuNer recently tweeted, “Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan. 2017.” Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan 2017. pic.twitter.com/kxPds6GZUF\n— Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) May 27, 2018\nGranted, if you entered the market after January 2017, this information might not be relevant. Indeed, if you are a short-term cryptocurrency investor, you might be losing money.\nShort-term and long-term investments carry different degrees of risk. Short-term investing carries more downside risk because it more closely resembles gambling.\nOn the other hand, long-term investment involves holding a vehicle for more than a year, or several years. Therefore, early Bitcoin adopters are doing well, even if they have had to suffer long bear market periods, as shown in the chart below.\nFinancial investors advise diversifying. For instance, Edward Jones, Financial Advisor, writes :\nAs an investor, you’ll probably need a mix of long-term and short-term vehicles. By knowing the differences between these two categories, you should have a good idea of what to expect from your investments — and this knowledge can help you make those choices that are right for you. The Trend Is Your Friend\nCertainly, whether Bitcoin’s price will continue its ascending trajectory is unknown. Nevertheless, predictions on both sides abound .\nFor example, The Motley Fool predicts that the entrance of institutional investors will be detrimental “as it introduces their crypto skepticism and deep pockets into the equation.”\nConversely, others predict that Bitcoin’s price will increase precisely because of the entrance of institutional investors. Explaining why “Bitcoin is a buy despite its continued losses,” Spencer Bogart, blockchain venture capitalist, declared to CNBC :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nIndeed, there are as many predictions as predictors. But the truth is that financial markets are unpredictable.

After their website was blocked last year, the assets streamed to a law enforcement fund.\nThe selloff of seized assets, which is Germany’s biggest to date, started in late February, when Bitcoin’s value had abruptly dipped after a record high of almost $20,000 at the end of 2017. Its value then went below $7,000 and then climbed up to $9,000.

That’s what the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently looking into as part of a new criminal probe into crypto crimes.\nThe investigation comes on the heels of complaints by crypto critics that crypto markets are being scammed by savvy traders who know how to “spoof” the trading platforms and flood them with fake buy and sell orders. Such crimes can drive the price of a crypto way up, or cause it to plunge way down, apart from natural market forces.\nIt isn’t exactly a good thing for the reputation of cryptocurrency in general, which requires honesty, transparency, and accountability if people are going to trust using it. That the crypto world is essentially rife with misconduct at this current juncture is precisely why the DoJ is now getting involved, along with the help of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivatives specifically tied to Bitcoin .\nWhile crypto exchanges are expected to go after these bad players themselves, this obviously doesn’t always happen – hence the DoJ involvement. And with all of the crazy price swings with Bitcoin over the past year, many say there isn’t a better time than now for regulators to start cracking down and cleaning up the crypto world.\nWhat the DoJ is specifically focused on are spoofing and wash trading, two forms of cheating that regulators have been working for years to eradicate from both the futures and equities markets. Spoofers essentially submit a spate of orders that they then cancel after prices have moved in the desired direction. Wash traders basically trade with themselves, which creates an illusion of artificial market demand, again in order to manipulate prices.\nThese criminal elements within the crypto trading world likely explain why Bitcoin rose from around $1,000 in early 2017 to almost $20,000 by the year’s end. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering right around $7,500. Finance professor says committing crypo fraud is “easy”\nIt’s the mom and pop investors who are being hit the hardest by these scams, as many of them assume the crypto markets are regulated in a similar manner to traditional money markets. Natural supply and demand, in other words, isn’t necessarily at work when it comes to crypto trading, and it’s the price manipulators who are largely to blame, critics say.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also cracking down on crypto crimes , with its own investigation into rampant fraud with initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which are basically digital tokens that some up-and-coming companies offer to investors in exchange for their investments.\nBecause the concept of cryptos is still so new, regulators haven’t yet figured out how to properly keep tabs on which ones are real and which ones are fake. This is especially problematic with fly-by-night ICOs, many of which have defrauded investors of tens of millions of dollars.\nAnother problem is that many crypto trading platforms still aren’t registered with either the CFTC or the SEC, which means they could disappear in an instant, along with the money of everyone who used them to make an investment.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing, and wash trading,” says John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who studies manipulation, including that of digital coin markets. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nOne of the most well-known examples of this is a trader, or group of traders, widely known as “Spoofy” that allegedly placed orders as high as $1 million, only to not execute them, thus driving the price of crypto toward Spoofy’s desired target.\nRead Bitraped.com for more coverage of the coming Bitcoin collapse.\nSources for this article include:", "highlightText": "",

With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. One of the busiest metros in Europe, over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway daily.\nThe company published an update on its website where it provides a detailed description of the location of each ATM. The new machines were installed in Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka and Hlavní Nádraží.\nAccording to Coinatmradar.com , the Czech Republic now has 46 bitcoin ATMs, with 34 of these ATMs concentrated in Prague. Of the 3,138 bitcoin ATMs manufactured globally, GENERAL BYTES has now manufactured 27.63 percent, with their machines installed in every major city in the world . Their ATMs support the purchase and sale of bitcoin, litecoin, dash and monero.\nIn conversation with Bitcoin Magazine , Martijn Wismeijer, Marketing Manager of GENERAL BYTES, described his company as \"veterans in the blockchain space who have been there from the very beginning.\" He pointed out that the company was \"the first to introduce sending cryptos via email\" as well as the creator of the first BATMOne models.\nWismeijer said his company offers \"seven different cryptocurrency ATM models as well as a point-of-sale (POS) called CortexPay.\" These crypto ATM models are all based on a similar code base; however, he also explained that, even though the machines were similar in code base, there are some minor differences in the hardware design and a range of additional features. These features include the capacity of the acceptor, dispenser and recycler combinations as well as the acceptance of multi-currencies on a single machine.\nThe ATM models are called the BATM series ATM. BATM is the name of the platform created by GENERAL BYTES for producing the ATMs. These machines are further divided into the BATMTwo series (one-way and two-way options) and the BATMThree series ATMs.\nAccording to Wismeijer, the one-way BATMTwo series ATMs were chosen for this project as there are already many two-way ATM locations in and around the city. \"Installing the one-way BATMTwo models allows GENERAL BYTES to showcase the possibilities that abound for clients brand-wise with the optional BATMStand which transforms the machines into a free-standing unit.\"\nWismeijer explained that clients can either run and maintain their servers or they can use the company's cloud-hosted server, which allows operators to run their software on GENERAL BYTES' server for a small fee.\nCryptocurrencies in Prague Prague has been a growing hotspot for everything crypto for a while now.\nThere hasn't been much definition or regulation of virtual currencies in the Czech Republic, and the government is seen to be somewhat friendly to cryptos.\nThe subject matter is, however, being discussed in government circles as the Czech National Bank published a paper titled \"Don't be Afraid of Bitcoin,\" where it declared that \"Prague is home to a strong community of cryptocurrency users,\" while playing down the potential threats of cryptocurrency to the traditional monetary system.\nLast year, Alza became the \"first large European retailer\" to add cryptocurrency payments to its website and install two bitcoin ATMs in its showroom locations in Prague and Bratislava.\nThe hip and trendy Holešovice district in Prague is also home to the famous Cryptoanarchy Institute, Paralelni Polis , an organization that educates the public on cryptocurrencies. Prague is also home to a couple of crypto startups like SatoshiLabs (makers of Trezor hardware wallets).

The hacker could attempt to double-spend stolen coins from an exchange by exchanging them into fiat currency or another crypto and using the same coins from his or her wallet to buy more crypto.\nThe online publication Bitcoinist estimates that the hacker stole $18 million worth of bitcoin gold. Bitcoin gold is the latest crypto to suffer from a 51% attack. The Verge has reportedly suffered three 51% attacks this year.\nThe latest one occurred yesterday. Last week, a hacker exploited a vulnerability that had caused the previous 51% attack to decamp with $35 million worth of its cryptocurrency. According to recent research, the costs for hacking cryptocurrencies are declining.\nThis is partly due to the increasing number of forks within cryptocurrencies. For example, according to a recent post on Medium an average of $70 million is required to cripple ethereum classic’s blockchain.\nThat amount can easily be generated by using profits generated from mining ethereum, a cryptocurrency that uses the same algorithm. The same post estimated a cost of $200,000 to instigate a 51% attack on bitcoin gold.

To get it, go to the official download page and click the button next to “Ubuntu” . After the download is done, open the file manager and double-click on it to open the Debian file with the Gdebi package installation tool. Click “install” to finish the process. Otherwise, install via terminal with: cd ~/Downloads sudo dpkg -i minergate-8.1.deb sudo apt install -f Arch Linux\nArch isn’t officially supported, but that doesn’t matter as there is an AUR package available for installation.\nNote: the Minergate version available for Arch is currently version 7.1, and not 8 like the ones officially supported.\nTo start off, open up the terminal and use the Pacman package tool to install the latest version of the Git package. sudo pacman -S git\nWith the latest version of Git working, use it to grab the Minergate package from the AUR. git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/minergate.git\nUsing the makepkg tool, build and install Minergate. Keep in mind that though makepkg installs most dependencies, some may fail to install. If this happens to you, you’ll need to install them manually here . makepkg -si Fedora\nHead over to the download page for Minergate GUI miner and click the download button next to the Fedora Linux logo . When done, open up the file manager and go to the “Downloads” folder. Double-click on the RPM file to open it up in Gnome Software. Click “Install” to finish the installation process.\nAlternatively, install Minergate on Fedora with the terminal and DNF. Start off by using the CD command and move the terminal to the ~/Downloads folder. cd ~/Downloads\nInstall the program using the DNF package tool. sudo dnf install minergate-8.1.rpm OpenSUSE\nSuse and Fedora use the same package system, so Suse users should have no issue installing the Fedora RPM to use Minergate. To get started, head to the download page and click the button next to “Fedora” . Next, open up the file manager, click “Downloads” and double-click on the Minergate RPM file. Finish up by clicking “install” inside Gnome Software.\nWant to install via terminal? Use CD to move to ~/Downloads , then install with Zypper . cd ~/Downloads sudo zypper install minergate-8.1.rpm Using Minergate\nTo start using Minergate, open up the application menu, search for “Minergate” and click on it. Once launched, log into your Minergate account and select “Start mining.”\nBy default, Minergate will start mining an alternative coin. Since we want to mine Bitcoin Gold, click the pickaxe icon to select the right currency. Minergate tends to hide some currencies, so you may need to select the “show all” button.\nThe Minergate mining tool supports a lot of different currencies. Look through, find “BTG” and click the “start mining” button. This should automatically start the mining process.\nMining speed and effectiveness all depends on how powerful your PC is. Also, keep in mind that earning BTG takes a long time, so don’t expect to cash out right away. Leave it running in the background and forget about it. Who knows, maybe one day you’ll wake up to a couple free coins! Mining Other Coins\nMinergate’s GUI mining tool is very easy to use and lets users mine multiple currencies at a time. If you’re not satisfied with just Bitcoin Gold, consider enabling one of the other popular currencies in the tool. To start mining alternative currencies alongside Bitcoin Gold, go back to the mining menu, and click “start mining”. Instantly, mining should start.\nPlease understand that if you choose to mine multiple currencies at once, it could take away from the power of mining BTG. If your only goal is to earn BTG, pick one at a time and stick with it.

The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

Bitcoin used $7,120 as a support while the bulls were eyeing $7,600. At the moment, BTC/USD is trading a bullish flag pattern pending another upside breakout.\nIt is still unclear what caused the sudden upsurge in Bitcoin on Tuesday 29, however, one of FXSTREET writers, Yohay Elam believes that there is a connection between the political discord in Italy. ‘Italexit’ might have been the boost that took Bitcoin from trading $7,120 to above $7,500. The elections in March resulted in an economic crisis in the country. Italy’s stock prices have plummeted almost similar to the Brexit situation in Great Britain. The money flowing out of Italy’s bonds, the Euro as well as the global stocks could have ended up in the crypto market . Elam Yohay wrote referring to the crisis in Italy, “When the establishment is in crisis, alternatives are sought after.”\nHowever, at the time of writing, Bitcoin price is supported at $7,500. There is a bullish trend in progress which could test $7,600 again. There are a couple of other support areas at $7,440 and $7,400 respectively. The MACD is slightly in the positive region, moreover the Stochastic is above the 70 mark showing that the bulls still have the momentum to push for higher corrections.\nBTC/USD 15’ chart\n(Click to enlarge) Ethereum price is up 1.44 percent on the day, although it is facing immediate resistance at $580. Besides, applying the Fibonacci levels shows that the area around $580 is a major hurdle towards $600.\nA report in the market says that more than 1,000 decentralized applications have been developed and launched on Ethereum network. This comes after the ‘ConsenSys Community Day’ that took place in Tel Aviv earlier in the week. The event is organized in support of the Ethereum blockchain. Speaking at the conference, Christian Crowley, an analyst from Alethio a company specializing in Ethereum blockchain said that the network has reached 29.2 million addresses that are unique. Moreover, there are more than 100,000 new users on Ethereum network on average daily.\nAt the moment, Ethereum price is trading between the moving averages support and resistance. The 50 SMA is preventing gains to the upside, while the 100 SMA is supporting the price close to $560 (23.6 percent Fib retracement level). ETH/USD has formed a bullish flag pattern but is still at risk of downward movements. A stronger support, is, however, expected at $520 but $500 will be an overstretch for Ethereum. The Stochastic on the 1-hour chart is moving upwards toward 50 signaling that the buyers still have the momentum to attack $580.\nETH/USD 1-hour chart\n(Click to enlarge)\nRipple, the third largest coin by market value, is changing hands at $0.6160, amid quiet trading session. The recovery momentum has faded away on approach to $0.6200 resistance, while 200-SMA (hourly chart) serves as a good short-term support Related: Tech Giants Struggle To Comply With New Privacy Laws\nAs we reported earlier, two Canadian banks were hacked with over 90,000 accounts compromised. The thieves demand $1M ransom paid in XRP for a safe return of personal data, which is somewhat unusual as hackers traditionally request Bitcoins.\nAttackers were going to leak the information if they didn’t receive the payment before May 28 2018 11:59PM and probably they did it as the banks were not eager to comply to the requirements.\n“Our practice is not to make payments to fraudsters,” Bank of Montreal said. “We are focused on protecting and helping our customers.”\nMeanwhile the community is discussing how such unwanted popularity among hackers may influence XRP price and whether Ripple company should step in and block the transaction. It’s an interesting case as it brings us back to a moral choice between immutability and non-intrusion and countering harmful and illegal activities.\nXRP/USD , the hourly chart\nBy John Isige via FX Street\nPublished at Wed, 30 May 2018 15:00:00 +0000 Related Info", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://safehaven.com/article/45527/Tech-Giants-Struggle-To-Comply-With-New-Privacy-Laws", "https://safehaven.com/article/45531/Bitcoin-Fights-Back-After-Hitting-Monthly-Low", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/ethusd", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/xrpusd", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/italexit-fears-and-bitcoins-bounce-just-a-coincidence-or-are-cryptos-also-safe-havens-201805291603", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies", "https://safehaven.com/contributors/John-Isige"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john isige", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yohay elam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elam yohay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "great britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:55:21.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7edd101ccae582b6105b16b59714ccfd82b65475", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._Vax7Ru8JSp5IflbCU3j1K6sk2F.8UnjZ.VlyzcT6ep4bIjuFIUI7p0dxUF8XnkcT1boL6nDqRMDT8Voq00OwH435mR87kPPuKQPBar9FSClaALrOdBuCCu3GKz41nFSXvt9ytMvrXXAnkmI_evi2YnhgkhwIHPk-", "site_full": "www.nagpurnewsdesk.net", "site": "nagpurnewsdesk.net", "site_section": "http://www.nagpurnewsdesk.net/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nagpur News Desk", "title": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to 1 US dollar", "title_full": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to 1 US dollar", "published": "2018-05-30T19:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7edd101ccae582b6105b16b59714ccfd82b65475", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._Vax7Ru8JSp5IflbCU3j1K6sk2F.8UnjZ.VlyzcT6ep4bIjuFIUI7p0dxUF8XnkcT1boL6nDqRMDT8Voq00OwH435mR87kPPuKQPBar9FSClaALrOdBuCCu3GKz41nFSXvt9ytMvrXXAnkmI_evi2YnhgkhwIHPk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-30T19:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "International Blockchain Economic Conference: Bitcoin Will Drop to 1 US dollar", "text": "May 30 16:51 2018 by admin On May 8, 2018, Dubai Business Bay, the famous world’s tallest hotel – JW Marriott Marquis Hotel, International Blockchain Economic Conference was held here. The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

While we’d expect many motherboards coming from ASUS to be aimed at gamers or mainstream PC builders, this new one is all about cryptocurrency mining. Say hello to the ASUS H370 Mining Master motherboard.\nThis is actually a follow up to the B250 Mining Expert, which was released last year. In its announcement today, ASUS said that the B250 performed well beyond expectations, with excellent sales that proved there’s a space in the market for motherboards centered around cryptocurrency mining. The H370 Mining Master, therefore, is a refinement of what ASUS started with the B250.\nWhat makes the H370 different from your usual motherboard? All you need to do is look at an image of the hardware and you’ll know right away, as its 20 PCIe-over-USB ports definitely stand out. With these, ASUS is looking to simplify the process of connecting multiple GPUs to your motherboard.\nTypically, mining rigs are built around multiple graphics cards that are connected to the motherboard using GPU risers. These risers provide external PCIe slots for your various GPUs, and many of them transfer data over a USB cable that connects to your motherboard’s PCIe x1 slot. ASUS is removing a step from that process – instead of attaching an x1 connector to the end of your riser’s USB cable, you can instead plug the cable directly into one of the PCIe-over-USB ports on the H370.\nThis change accomplishes a few things. It saves on space, allowing your motherboard to host more external PCIe connections, and it removes the need for x1 connectors entirely, cutting down on the number of parts required for your mining rig and providing a more sturdy connection between your risers and your motherboard. Have a look at the full list of specifications below.\nSize – ATX, 12”x9.1” Socket – LGA 1151 for Intel 8th Gen Core / Pentium / Celeron processors Memory – 2 x DIMMs (max. 32GB), DDR4 2666 / 2400 / 2133 MHz, Non-ECC, unbuffered memory PCIe – 1 x PCIe x16 slot Storage – 2 x Serial ATA 6.0 Gb/s connectors Networking – 1 x Intel Gigabit LAN USB GPU Riser Ports – 20 x Vertical USB ports over PCIe USB Ports – 6 x USB 3.1 Gen 1, 4 x USB 2.0 / 1.1 ports Other Ports – 1 x COM header\nASUS is also launching the H370 Mining Master with “a suite of diagnostic features designed to make your platform easier to manage.” GPU State Detection plays an important role in these diagnostic features, scanning your system on start up to determine which of those PCIe-over-USB ports are empty, which are connected to an operational GPU, and which (if any) of your GPUs are experiencing problems.\nAll in all, it sounds like this motherboard will allow you utilize a lot of horsepower while simplifying the process of building your mining rig, and that can only be a good thing. It’ll be a while longer before it arrives on shelves here in North America, as ASUS is currently targeting a Q3 2018 release. No word on pricing just yet, but we can probably expect it to be priced similarly (if not a little higher) than the B250.

The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point.
