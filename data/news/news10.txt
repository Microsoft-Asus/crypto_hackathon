At the start of the year, the consensus was that the number one cryptocurrency would reach even greater heights. However, BTC prices have declined from its record-setting highs of $19,500 in mid-December 2017 to hovering around the $7,700 mark. Bitcoin will Approach the $15,000 Mark by December 2018\nFinder, a financial comparison platform, released a Bitcoin forecast that said BTC prices would cross the $30,000 mark by December 2018. Six months into the year, the platform seems to have revised its predictions with a new report released in June. According to the latest forecast figures, Bitcoin will end the year trading at $14,638. This new figure predicts an almost 100 percent increase in BTC price based on its current trading value.\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction panel consists of 10 members with experience in the digital currency and blockchain industry. The figures published by Finder are an extrapolation of the individual predictions of each panelist. Examining the figures published by Finder, the lowest end-of-year BTC price prediction was $5,778 while the highest was $25,000. Some of the members of the panel include James Lynch of Castlecoin, Aaron LePoidevin of Every Capital, and Kunal Patel of the Gerson Lehman Group.\nSpeaking to The Independent , David Hanson, CEO of Ultra, said that he expected Bitcoin to continue hovering between $6,500 and $8,500. According to Fundstrat analyst, Robert Sluymer , Bitcoin’s bottom price is $7,000. Thus, with an influx of institutional investors, the price of BTC is expected to increase. Many experts and commentators share this notion that the entry of institutional investors into the market will drive up prices. In 2018, people like Tom Lee, also of Fundstrat, Dan Morehead (Pantera CEO), and Iqbal Gandham of eToro have expressed similar views. EOS to See the Highest Gains\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction survey highlighted EOS as the cryptocurrency to watch. The results of the survey indicate a predicted price of $38.25 at the end of the year. Based on the current value of Eos tokens, this price estimate is a 200 percent increase. According to Hanson, EOS is generating a great deal of interest in the market, especially with the hype surrounding its mainnet launch. In a recent Weiss rating report , EOS was also identified as one of the best altcoins in the market.\nHow accurate do you think these predictions are?

Interested investors will have the opportunity to bid up to 49 percent of the shares in the picture. The new procedure is intended to revolutionize the art market.\nArtworks have always been highly valued objects of desire. Passionate collectors spend whole fortunes on an oil painting or a sculpture, if the creator is considered significant enough. For wealthy families, such pieces are reliable and secure assets that they can pass on for generations. However, the art market has always been a world apart. Here, art dealers and gallery owners spend millions on individual works in passing, which is often incomprehensible to outside observers.\nHow does the art auction work on Blockchain?\nThe Maecenas gallery owners in London see blockchain technology as an opportunity to revive the art market by “democratizing” it. On their platform they divide the individual works of art into thousands of digital certificates, much like a company that makes itself in the form of shares. These certificates are tamper-proof thanks to Blockchain’s cryptographic features, allowing investors to trade digitally with no hassle and middlemen.\nOnce a piece of art is listed on Maecenas, a bidding process begins. Investors make confident bids on how many certificates they want to buy for what price. Bidders must go through a KYC (Know your customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) check in advance. According to Maecenas, crypto technology makes this process safer, fairer and harder to manipulate than previous art auctions. Prices are quoted in fiat and cryptocurrencies, with buyers able to choose how they pay. A separate token called ART should avoid conversion risks.\n14 electric chairs\nFor the first art action on the Blockchain, the dealers have chosen a highly esteemed work by pop art legend Andy Warhol. Warhol revolutionized the art world with his techniques of reproduction in his day. There was no longer a single work by the artist, but entire series. His neon-colored Marilyn Monroes and Campbell’s soup jars hang in various designs around the world.\nSo it is with the “14 Small Electric Chairs”, which will be the object of the first crypto auction. In 1960, for the first time, he alienated a picture of an electric chair as part of his “Death and Disaster Series”, duplicated it and banned it as an abstract pattern on canvas. His electric chairs are now hanging in numerous museums, including the Tate in London and the Guggenheim in New York.\nThe now auctioned work was created in 1980, when Warhol reworked his old motifs for his “Reversals” series. The picture is estimated at 5.6 million US dollars, Maecenas has set a reserve price of 4 million. The Blockchain Art Auction will kick off on June 20 at the Dadiani Fine Art Gallery in London.

Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise. The series began on Microsoft Windows, and later expanded to consoles and handhelds. Several spin-off games have been released. The earlier games in the series are set primarily in World War II, but later games like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare are set in modern times or in futuristic settings. The most recent game, Call of Duty: WWII, was released on November 3, 2017. An upcoming title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, is in development and to be released in October 2018.\nThe Call of Duty games are published and owned by Activision Blizzard.

Both companies have previously tried to launch a Bitcoin ETF offering but failed to receive regulatory clearance. ‘A Clear Understanding of the Potential of Bitcoin’\nVanEck and SolidX have entered into a partnership to list a “physically-backed Bitcoin ETF.” VanEck will be responsible for the marketing services function while SolidX will handle the ETF sponsorship. The ETF application was filed with the SEC on June 5, 2018.\nCommenting on the partnership, John van Eck, the CEO of VanEck, told Business Wire :\nI believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\nIn 2017, VanEck filed the first ever 40-Act Bitcoin ETF. In 2016, SolidX filed the first-ever physically-backed Bitcoin ETF. The two firms are now hoping to get approval this time around.\nDaniel Gallancy, the CEO of SolidX, expressed optimism at the new approach, stating:\nIn determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.\nIf the filing sails through, the ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange under the ticker “XBTC.” The Quest for Bitcoin ETFs\nDespite concerted efforts by both cryptocurrency and fintech firms, the SEC has resisted the clamor for Bitcoin ETFs.\nWith the emergence of Bitcoin futures in December 2017, many observers thought ETFs would soon follow . However, that hasn’t been the case. For the SEC, issues over fair pricing, asset valuation, and custody — as well as sufficient liquidity — continue to be a concern.\nIn the past, the SEC has asked some firms to withdraw their Bitcoin ETF applications while indefinitely delaying the approval of others.\nWill the VanEck-SolidX Bitcoin ETF partnership obtain the necessary regulatory greenlight? Do you think Bitcoin ETFs will cause prices of the leading cryptocurrency to increase? Share your views in the comment section below!\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, iStock.

There was a break below a major connecting bullish trend line with support at $7,640 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $7,600 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid further slides.\nBitcoin price is currently correcting lower against the US Dollar. BTC/USD might bounce back from $7,600 if buyers defend the 100 hourly SMA. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter a decent upside move , bitcoin price faced a lot of offers near the $7,750 level against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a short-term top near $7,748 and started a downside correction. It declined and moved below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the last wave from the $7,350 low to $7,748 high. There seems to be a minor increase in selling pressure below the $7,700 level.\nMore importantly, there was a break below a major connecting bullish trend line with support at $7,640 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is currently trading above the $7,600 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the last wave from the $7,350 low to $7,748 high is also around the $7,600 support. Should there be a bearish break below the $7,600 support, the price could extend declines towards the $7,500 level.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a bearish trend line on the upside with resistance at $7,680. A successful break and close above the trend line and $7,700 may perhaps clear the path for more gains in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving lower and is currently moving well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,600 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T13:46:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "075ea632c1c0fbbf3d63bc1e54a4c299c782bf26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcGb209d93Z1XQgA6tK_QKUBG3EIEvnbw_mlkiThA.Jzd0v.4O.bvubJd4OvXBlNMV", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - ZipZap grinds to a halt in the UK - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - ZipZap grinds to a halt in the UK - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5857331527_dc8ae729bb_b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "075ea632c1c0fbbf3d63bc1e54a4c299c782bf26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcGb209d93Z1XQgA6tK_QKUBG3EIEvnbw_mlkiThA.Jzd0v.4O.bvubJd4OvXBlNMV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - ZipZap grinds to a halt in the UK - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – ZipZap grinds to a halt in the UK Best New – ZipZap grinds to a halt in the UK Best New Cryptocurrency By root / June 8, 2018\nZipZap inc – one of the most promising startups within the digital currency sector has allegedly terminated operations in the UK.\nUntil recently the “Cash 4 Bitcoin” service allowed customers to purchase Bitcoins in exchange for cold hard cash at thousands of locations around the country but apparently due to ongoing problems with PayPoint (the company that manages the payment processing infrastructure behind ZipZap) cash deposits have been terminated until legal clarity around digital currencies is released by the UK government and Financial Conduct Authority.\nZipZap enabled customers to simply pop into one of 28,000 PayPoint participating shops across the United Kingdom and exchange cash for Bitcoins with minimal effort.\nThe launch of ZipZap was exciting news for the Bitcoin community for a number of reasons.

The Peerplays blockchain has enabled us to do just that,\" said Jonathan Baha 'i, President of the Peerplays Blockchain Standards Association (PBSA). \"Today, I'm thrilled to announce the public beta launch of the first provably fair sports betting app, BookiePro.\"\nThe launch of the BookiePro public beta marks the first official decentralized app operating on the Peerplays blockchain as well as the first public showcase of provably fair sports betting. No single person, company, or central authority owns or operates BookiePro.\n\"I'm very proud of the work our talented team has done to bring the BookiePro public beta to users. Adding to the excitement of the World Cup, users will be able to experience a truly decentralized betting exchange for the first time,\" said Toby Lynas , Head of Operations at PBSA.\nThe exchange is now live with users able to download and install the app from http://www.BookiePro.fun .

Nor is HBUS to be referenced as “Huobi US” or any variant thereof. HBUS is the “exclusive US strategic partner of Huobi.”\nHBUS’ Medium post, dated June 5, indicates a ‘soft launch’ – pre-registration – date of June 10, offering all users who sign up between June 10 and June 14 a month of trading without fees.\nOfficial trading is set to launch June 15, although HBUS’ website suggests that “overwhelming demand” may postpone the launch, and appeals to the public to sign up for a newsletter and its Telegram channel to be notified when registration opens.\nHuobi, originally founded in China , first revealed its plans to open an office in San Francisco in January this year. Now headquartered in Singapore, the exchange has been vigorously targeting overseas markets, launching a South Korean subsidiary, as well as announcing plans to open an office in London.\nThe US context places high demands on crypto exchanges to come under the purview of regulators, and an HBUS post this week has duly stressed that all its employees have been “educated” in Anti-Money-Laundering ( AML ) and Counter-Terrorism Financing ( KYC ), and have been “required to pass tests” on the subjects.\nAs it vies with leading rival crypto exchanges Binance and OKEx , Huobi has been actively diversifying its investment products and services, announcing the launch of its new public blockchain just two days ago.\nEarlier this month, Huobi launched a crypto-based exchange traded fund (ETF), a type of mutual fund that divides ownership of underlying digital assets into shares. The ETF is based on its recently launched market index, which tracks the exchange’s 10 top-traded digital assets against Tether (USDT).\nOn June 2nd, Huobi entered into a partnership to launch a $93 mln China-South Korea investment fund for blockchain startups, aiming to foster collaboration between the two countries.

The move, which was approved in February , will see the mining service invest up to $700 million and the creation of 150 jobs in the coming months.\nThe company remains unfazed by the slump in bitcoin prices, which has seen a drop of almost 50 percent this year, according to data from Coinmarketcap .\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine , Coinmint CTO Prieur Leary said, \"Current bitcoin prices affect the value proposition.

This is the first cryptocurrency that Satoshi Nakamoto opened to the world in 2009. And if even before 2011 it was used exclusively by programmers, then later it became available to ordinary users. Over time, more and more users of the Internet began to learn about it and investments in bitcoin only increase every year. There were times when the value of this cryptocurrency did not move from a dead point for a long time, as well as there were sharp UPS and downs.\nIt is interesting to know how many people have known about bitcoin since 2009 and how long have you been investing in bitcoin?\nWhat percentage of the profits is brought to you by early investments in bitcoin?\nTo date, the percentage of people who know about bitcoin is still too low, and investments in bitcoin are small and can grow several times. Even those people who will go into the world of crypto currency today and buy bitcoin at today's price I'm sure will not lose !.\nI learned new things in this and about crypto-currencies myself only in the last year when the market was at the top. Accordingly, my investments have not brought me any income yet. they are small. We will wait for the next growth and learn to earn!\nYou're saying it right. All who buy bitcoin now, in the future will not lose. Let many people think that it is a pyramid or something else. You just now take it and risk, do as others do. After all, many know that 80% of all money is in the hands of 20%. So why don't you be in those 20%.)))", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:58:24.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fdf83197900d37fa559aecb1baf282c524040684", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cMfTbS33dax4.uKKU88DRkSuGT4SSfl8P69SPEFJYgUYaglsLQ1IhLQGpbisGYIo-", "site_full": "www.therxforum.com", "site": "therxforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.therxforum.com/forumdisplay.php?f=289", "site_categories": ["bodybuilding", "politics", "scuba_diving", "law_government_and_politics", "sports"], "section_title": "Community Contests", "title": "what happened to the free nhl bitcoin playoff contest?", "title_full": "what happened to the free nhl bitcoin playoff contest?", "published": "2018-06-08T02:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CR", "spam_score": 0.994, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fdf83197900d37fa559aecb1baf282c524040684", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cMfTbS33dax4.uKKU88DRkSuGT4SSfl8P69SPEFJYgUYaglsLQ1IhLQGpbisGYIo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stale", "published": "2018-06-08T02:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "what happened to the free nhl bitcoin playoff contest?", "text": "by rx drew", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T03:47:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a13c393c37fc07ec2762ba245f1f4b175929e63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfDCfT5th4xv0h3_rua1Fre8EJoMqkmAHWZWxXsDwSI4ScOEgFqnPkgnKJaogD3gYf", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.", "title_full": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.", "published": "2018-06-08T02:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a13c393c37fc07ec2762ba245f1f4b175929e63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfDCfT5th4xv0h3_rua1Fre8EJoMqkmAHWZWxXsDwSI4ScOEgFqnPkgnKJaogD3gYf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T02:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.", "text": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.\nJimmy Aki\nCoinmint , a cloud mining service provider, has confirmed it will go ahead with its proposed plan to open a cryptocurrency mining plant in an abandoned smelter previously used by Alcoa, in Massena, New York.\nIn a statement published online , the company said it will repurpose the 1,300-acre, 435-megawatt site into the biggest cryptocurrency mining plant in the world. The move, which was approved in February , will see the mining service invest up to $700 million and the creation of 150 jobs in the coming months.\nThe company remains unfazed by the slump in bitcoin prices, which has seen a drop of almost 50 percent this year, according to data from Coinmarketcap .\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine , Coinmint CTO Prieur Leary said, \"Current bitcoin prices affect the value proposition. That being said, we are very comfortable with current metrics, given our technology and infrastructure.\"\nCoinmint sees upstate New York as the perfect environment for them to set up shop. Operations have begun at the complex through Coinmint's wholly owned subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, and the facility is expected to be at full capacity within 12 months.\nThe company believes this move will impact the crypto industry in a positive way. Leary went further by saying that \"given the current concentration of digital currency data centers in Asia, launching the largest of such facilit[ies] in the U.S. makes a bold statement that the West is active within the industry and is a driver of growth and innovation within the space.\"\nNew York is not known for being friendly to crypto companies or to miners, but as Steven O'Shaughnessy, Massena's town supervisor, remarked in a local interview , \"Our main marketing point is that we have cheap, reliable power.\"\nMining is a power-hungry activity that has been getting a lot of attention lately.\nIn May, an expert panel met at a mining conference to discuss the implications of high energy consumption among miners worldwide, where they refuted the notion that energy devoted to proof-of-work operations is a wasteful by-product of cryptocurrency mining.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jimmy aki coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prieur leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinmint cto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alcoa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massena", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T02:27:45.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7841814757a1f22e9ca9e7ad613200220c154cdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT8KOdwT.HXw.b6pOp1DGqRs8PHpbO5eq2PzkyWNv63IWUSxcEaV6t38JdFzQizs2Qf4LGTMjr3HJy7IxkiO7_PJQKqf7IOuoaKan1yZn28L5xUlhZ0V0CKd8Rpf076ukJvvS6I99sqEw--", "site_full": "www.symphonious.net", "site": "symphonious.net", "site_section": "https://www.symphonious.net", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Symphonious", "title": "Bitcoin Redux: crypto crime, and how to tackle it | Light Blue Touchpaper", "title_full": "Bitcoin Redux: crypto crime, and how to tackle it | Light Blue Touchpaper", "published": "2018-06-08T02:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7841814757a1f22e9ca9e7ad613200220c154cdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT8KOdwT.HXw.b6pOp1DGqRs8PHpbO5eq2PzkyWNv63IWUSxcEaV6t38JdFzQizs2Qf4LGTMjr3HJy7IxkiO7_PJQKqf7IOuoaKan1yZn28L5xUlhZ0V0CKd8Rpf076ukJvvS6I99sqEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adrian Sutton", "published": "2018-06-08T02:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Redux: crypto crime, and how to tackle it | Light Blue Touchpaper", "text": "Interesting review of the regulatory landscape around crypto-currencies.

Bitcoin Redux explains what’s going wrong in the world of cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin exchanges are developing into a shadow banking system, which do not give their customers actual bitcoin but rather display a “balance” and allow them to transact with others. However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they’re both customers of the same exchange, it just adjusts their balances rather than doing anything on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European law, but is the law enforced? Not where it matters. We’ve been looking at the details.

It is closely associated with internet that uses cryptography, which is basically an activity where legible information is changed into a code that can not be cracked so as to tack all the transfers and purchases made.\nCryptography includes a history dating back to around the world War II, when there is a need to communicate in the most secure manner. Since that point, an evolution of the same has occurred and it has become digitalized today where different elements of computer science and mathematical theory are being useful for purpose of securing communications, money and data online.\nThe initial cryptocurrency\nThe very first cryptocurrency was introduced around 2009 and is also still well-known all over the world. Much more cryptocurrencies have since been introduced over the past couple of years and today you can find a lot of available on the internet.\nThe way that they work\nThis type of digital currency utilizes technology that is decentralized in order to allow the different users to help make payments that are secure as well as, to store money without necessarily using a name or even dealing with a financial institution. They may be mainly operate on a blockchain. A blockchain is actually a public ledger which is distributed publicly.\nThe cryptocurrency units are generally created employing a procedure that is referred to as mining. This usually involves using a computer power. Doing it by doing this solves the math problems which can be very complicated within the generation of coins. Users are merely able to purchase the currencies from your brokers and after that store them in cryptographic wallets where they could spend these with great ease.\nCryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain technology are still in the infant stages when considered in financial terms. More uses may emerge later on because there is no telling what else ldifzp be invented. The way forward for transacting on stocks, bonds and other sorts of financial assets would likely be traded using the Cotizacion and blockchain technology in the future.\nWhy would you use cryptocurrency?\nOne of many traits of these currencies is the fact they are secure and that they provide an anonymity level that you may not get somewhere else. There is absolutely no manner in which a transaction can be reversed or faked. This is certainly the best reason why you should consider using them.\nThe fees charged on this sort of currency can also be quite low and it is then an extremely reliable option when compared to the conventional currency. Considering they are decentralized in general, they could be accessed by anyone unlike banks where accounts are opened only by authorization.\nCryptocurrency financial markets are offering a new cash form and often the rewards can be great. You might produce a really small investment only to discover it has mushroomed into something great in a very short time.

The question remains, does Bitcoin facilitate socialist principles? During the 2008 financial crisis capitalism was temporarily questioned, until banks were bailed out and the cogs of capitalism were bump-started; at the same time Bitcoin came into being. If another likely financial crisis happens the ability to bump-start the global financial machine will be more difficult, and Bitcoin — the potential fix — will have to share the stage with returning questions of socialism over capitalism. Capitalism was at its greatest in the West during the post-war growth period of the 1950s–60s. Within the boundaries of heavy government regulation, a result of the great-depression, regimented capitalism created wealth shared through rising wages, which in turn helped egalitarian causes such as civil rights and social justice movements. During the same period Cold War game theory worked to marginalise humanity’s bond, as mathematician John Nash proved the ‘rational’ behaviour during nuclear war is to mistrust and betray your fellow human. Nash’s work was an appealing ideology for the West as it was in opposition to the tenets of trust and collectivism promoted by socialist Russia. During the Cold War, how could Western democracy demonise socialist states, whilst still maintaining regulated industries? The answer was to deregulate industries and allow ‘healthy’ competition between individuals using Nash’s game theory. So began the great deregulation of industries in the West during the 1970s under the guise of neoliberal freedom — stripping away the voting power of the individual and giving it to private entities, unaccountable rent-seekers whom it was decided would make better decisions regarding people’s interests. Martin Friedman acknowledged “freedom is not fairness”. “There is no society, only individuals” said Margaret Thatcher, whilst attacking the workers unions of the 1970s — or as Marx would put it a “nation is formed by the simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes”. The plight of the individual unbinds from one another until we are all as unempowered as potatoes, bouncing helplessly in a shared sack. The “right to vote” exercised less and less by individuals is symptomatic of undermining and weakening of unifying forces, such as Thatcher and Reagan’s attack of worker unions. In a neoliberal capitalist society participants are incentivised by “free markets” to mistrust one another. Marx believed capitalism gives society a tremendous push, but that push can only extend so far, then the inevitable polarisation of wealth in favour of the capitalists would create a friction between the proletariat (workers) and bourgeoisie (capitalists). That friction would spark revolution and a proletariat-controlled state would take control. Marx was deliberately ambiguous on the specifics of how and when the revolution would happen. Conversely, Lenin called for armed revolution using a vanguard of “professional revolutionaries”, which became the model for the violent-communist revolutions of Mao and Pol Pot. “Far more happiness can be obtained by union than disunion” — Robert Owen. The blame for the mass-murderous behaviour of Socialist tyrants such as Pol Pot, can be shouldered by the Leninist bloody inception of the Socialist State, and the trust given to State not to become corrupt: trust that power will not be taken by the power hungry. Fellowship and community are not bad things, the tragic legacy of Socialism is to associate bonds of human affection with mass-murder. During the 1980s communities developed around the free-software movement, a direct response to a friction between libertarian developers and software companies who were trying to make software property. The friction sparked revolution, a non-violent revolution that merely gave another option. Software development, production, distribution, and exchange could be owned or regulated by the community as a whole rather than by a central rent-seeker — a community made up of individuals, bound by a collective endeavour or goal. The Open-Source framework extended the development of software to encourage and acknowledge participation. Bitcoin’s most important property is that it is Free and Open-Source Software, designed to give freedom of exchange without a trusted third party. The project is owned and developed by the community as a whole and heavily resistant to rent-seeking behaviour. Bitcoin isn’t reliant upon the generally abused trust that socialism depends on, nor does it encourage — as a free market does — participants to mistrust one another; rather, Bitcoin doesn’t require trust from participants. Satoshi imagined libertarians would find it easy to identify with Bitcoin, but did not exclude other ideologies. In its first iteration, bitcoin is a system that disempowers the monopolising, plutocratic top 2% and empowers the other 98% with a politically neutral sound money, an improvement in the function of money Marx would approve of. If bitcoin is adopted universally as sound money, many of the fiscal roles of government will be replaced by Bitcoin. It is rational to imagine, as Wei Dai does in b-money, Bitcoin fulfilling additional use cases beyond money, at which point Bitcoin will begin to replace the state, or as a future socialist may prefer — Bitcoin will become the state. State is a nation under one government. Imagine Bitcoin as State and its government as decentralised consensus. The only power is in the form of acknowledgement for meaningful participation that benefits the community as a whole. Bitcoin (it could be argued) is a system born out of the friction between bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and will create “freedom with fairness” and a “society made of individuals”- rather than potatoes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://creativecommons.org/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "socialism jun", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T02:24:50.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8591bab4122000b1beefc663a0e25b905c24f358", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYHFycVDT7qUWKpEQBGmi3icafy73H3tiduVF_tCWzzEV.8whbvpqnGUKSWqn6htcB8Sa5GPuZeQ--", "site_full": "www.phpbbitalia.net", "site": "phpbbitalia.net", "site_section": "https://www.phpbbitalia.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=72", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-Topic - phpBB Italia", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "title_full": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - phpBB Italia", "published": "2018-06-08T02:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.965, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8591bab4122000b1beefc663a0e25b905c24f358", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYHFycVDT7qUWKpEQBGmi3icafy73H3tiduVF_tCWzzEV.8whbvpqnGUKSWqn6htcB8Sa5GPuZeQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helentuh", "published": "2018-06-08T02:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "text": "XEvil 4.0 + RCModule : NEW innovative software for breaking any Captcha\n1.

I can’t say the names of [the academic institutions] because that’s attorney-client but we have people mostly on the East Coast that have begun doing investments in this space on a fairly modest basis,” Lore told Oscar Williams-Grut of Business Insider in an interview . Real Institutional Adoption\nBy definition, an institutional investor is an entity that garners funds from different sources to purchase properties, securities, and assets. Institutional investors include entities like banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, endowments, and mutual funds.\nSmall hedge funds and medium-sized investment firms cannot be considered as institutional investors, contrary to the views of many investors in the cryptocurrency market. But, entities like universities and endowments are proper institutional investors that can allocate many billions of dollars into the cryptocurrency market and increase the liquidity of cryptocurrencies. Insiders say that institutions could begin investing in bitcoin sooner rather than later.\nHowever, for academic institutions and endowments to commit large sums of capital into the cryptocurrency market, proper custodian solutions are necessary, as cryptocurrency hedge fund Blocktower founder Ari Paul previously stated :\n“Institutional money started trickling into cryptocurrency in mid 2017, but it’s been slower than many (including myself) expected. That doesn’t mean it’s not coming. There are a lot of pieces that need to come together, one big piece being third party custody. Custody isn’t binary. It’s not like Coinbase custody will launch and suddenly every pension will throw $100m into BTC. It takes time for custody solutions to gain trustworthiness. But, I think we’ll have solid third party custody by September of this year.”\nLore echoed a similar sentiment to Paul and noted that the majority of investment that has come into the cryptocurrency market has come from high net-worth individuals and family offices, not institutional investors. But, Lore emphasized that there are several institutional investors that are actively involved in the cryptocurrency market, and once potential regulatory conflicts are avoided, institutions will begin to invest in the market.\nStill, Lore said that university endowment funds have already started to invest in the cryptocurrency market in a limited basis, adding that the growing interest toward the market by endowments show the strong potential of cryptocurrencies in the long-term.\n“We see academia as a tie between these somewhat young and enthusiastic fund managers and capital raising,” Lore added. Significance of University Endowments Showing Interest in Crypto\nUniversity endowments often manage many billions of dollars and the priority of endowments is to invest in safe haven assets that can sustain stability over the long run.`\nThe growing demand for cryptocurrency by academic institutions signify that institutional investors have started to acknowledge cryptocurrencies as a stable asset class that will eventually compete against traditional assets.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1002380599284428802", "https://www.businessinsider.de/universities-invest-cryptocurrency-2018-6?r=US&IR=T", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john lore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar williams-grut", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "capital fund law group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T02:54:08.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd5cfc007d3207db8908edb037278a89540798c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfMPijuiRbXSEQWbTupqpXT6jEPNteE4doMZL843U6nrWUKd1b0FZnCw--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "title_full": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "published": "2018-06-08T02:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd5cfc007d3207db8908edb037278a89540798c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfMPijuiRbXSEQWbTupqpXT6jEPNteE4doMZL843U6nrWUKd1b0FZnCw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T02:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "text": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years\n/u/HenryK81\nsubmitted by /u/HenryK81\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T02:05:46.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9987d3222d596c7a1c71fe76b02bf4a9f51d81cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRkYZHde2Ra4zj29VF5LT.YqS7APmvXzZXVs2X.t9rXuDPhjdwdR9rKjnNUIL1W4VhhiWyEHgIraA--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon on Bitcoin: ‘Just Beware’", "title_full": "Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon on Bitcoin: ‘Just Beware’", "published": "2018-06-08T02:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9987d3222d596c7a1c71fe76b02bf4a9f51d81cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRkYZHde2Ra4zj29VF5LT.YqS7APmvXzZXVs2X.t9rXuDPhjdwdR9rKjnNUIL1W4VhhiWyEHgIraA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-06-08T02:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon on Bitcoin: ‘Just Beware’", "text": "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

The move, which was approved in February , will see the mining service invest up to $700 million and the creation of 150 jobs in the coming months.\nThe company remains unfazed by the slump in bitcoin prices, which has seen a drop of almost 50 percent this year, according to data from Coinmarketcap .\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine , Coinmint CTO Prieur Leary said, “Current bitcoin prices affect the value proposition. That being said, we are very comfortable with current metrics, given our technology and infrastructure.”\nCoinmint sees upstate New York as the perfect environment for them to set up shop. Operations have begun at the complex through Coinmint’s wholly owned subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, and the facility is expected to be at full capacity within 12 months.\nThe company believes this move will impact the crypto industry in a positive way. Leary went further by saying that “given the current concentration of digital currency data centers in Asia, launching the largest of such facilit[ies] in the U.S. makes a bold statement that the West is active within the industry and is a driver of growth and innovation within the space.”\nNew York is not known for being friendly to crypto companies or to miners, but as Steven O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor, remarked in a local interview , “Our main marketing point is that we have cheap, reliable power.”\nMining is a power-hungry activity that has been getting a lot of attention lately.\nIn May, an expert panel met at a mining conference to discuss the implications of high energy consumption among miners worldwide, where they refuted the notion that energy devoted to proof-of-work operations is a wasteful by-product of cryptocurrency mining.

Leary went further by saying that “given the current concentration of digital currency data centers in Asia, launching the largest of such facilit[ies] in the U.S. makes a bold statement that the West is active within the industry and is a driver of growth and innovation within the space.”\nNew York is not known for being friendly to crypto companies or to miners, but as Steven O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor, remarked in a local interview , “Our main marketing point is that we have cheap, reliable power.”\nMining is a power-hungry activity that has been getting a lot of attention lately.\nIn May, an expert panel met at a mining conference to discuss the implications of high energy consumption among miners worldwide, where they refuted the notion that energy devoted to proof-of-work operations is a wasteful by-product of cryptocurrency mining.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-largest-digital-currency-data-center-commences-operations-300659812.html", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "http://www.wwnytv.com/story/37398396/bitcoin-miner-plans-to-locate-in-massena-employ-150", "https://www.coinmint.io/", "https://www.nypa.gov/-/media/nypa/documents/document-library/notices-and-agendas/trustees013018.pdf", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/first-bitcoin-mining-conference-hashes-over-high-cost-energy/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prieur leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinmint cto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alcoa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massena", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T03:37:43.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1639737d14dea7dabc34ae184216da3db28b590", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZy6bxvHpsmUogkH11V21VQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Does war affect the price of bitcoin?", "title_full": "Does war affect the price of bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-08T01:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.401, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1639737d14dea7dabc34ae184216da3db28b590", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZy6bxvHpsmUogkH11V21VQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cahgantenx", "published": "2018-06-08T01:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Does war affect the price of bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: zhanghoqi5 on April 14, 2018, 06:46:22 AM Mr Trump has announced a precise crackdown on Syria, a war that would destabilise the world and would buy other assets for safety.

(Image: Reuters) With his baby face, eyeglasses and go-to outfit of T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, Jihan Wu looks more like a geeky teenager than a self-made billionaire. But thanks to an early foray into cryptocurrencies, the soft-spoken 32-year-old is sitting on what may be one of the industry’s largest fortunes. Wu runs Bitmain Technologies Ltd., the world’s dominant producer of cryptocurrency mining chips. The Chinese company has been shrouded in secrecy since its founding five years ago, but Wu is gradually lifting the veil — and revealing clues about his personal wealth — as he pursues an expansion beyond the crypto-sphere that may eventually lead to an initial public offering.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News, Wu said Bitmain booked $2.5 billion of revenue last year and that he and co-founder Micree Zhan together own about 60 percent of the business. While Bitmain has few direct comparables, applying a multiple similar to that of publicly traded chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. and MediaTek Inc. would give the company a valuation of about $8.8 billion. That would make the co-founders’ holdings worth a combined $5.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nWu, who said he has a smaller stake than Zhan, declined to share details of his net worth, his cryptocurrency holdings and his other personal investments. He has previously said Bitmain is worth $12 billion. Zhan declined to comment. Given the uncertainty surrounding digital assets and the limited public information about Bitmain, any estimate of the Beijing-based company’s value — and its owners’ wealth — inevitably involves a lot of guesswork. But that could be about to change.\nAn IPO would not only open Bitmain’s books to the world, it would also allow the stock market to assign the company a value in real time. While Wu said he has no specific plans at the moment, he’s open to a listing in Hong Kong — or in an overseas market with U.S. dollar-denominated shares — because it would give early investors including Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital a chance to cash out. A public share sale would be a landmark event for both Bitmain and the broader crypto industry, which is slowly emerging from the shadows.\nMiners, developers and venture capitalists are opting for more transparency as they try to placate wary regulators and prove that last year’s boom in digital assets was more than just a flash in the pan. An IPO would also help boost Bitmain’s profile as the company branches out into areas including artificial intelligence, a field that enjoys the full-throated backing of Chinese authorities, unlike cryptocurrencies. “The challenge is advancing our technology beyond what we’ve already achieved,” Wu said in an interview at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong.\nOne of Bitmain’s biggest competitors, Canaan Inc., has already filed for a Hong Kong IPO that people with knowledge of the matter said could raise about $1 billion. Bitmain’s 2017 revenue was about twelve times that of Canaan’s. Both companies design custom chips known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. These are particularly good for the brute-force number crunching required by cryptocurrency miners, who verify virtual currency transactions and earn crypto-denominated rewards by solving complex math problems. ASICs are also useful for the heavy workloads associated with some forms of AI, such as machine learning.\nBitmain controls as much as 80 percent of the market for crypto mining gear, according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., whose most conservative estimate of the company’s operating profit is similar to that of Nvidia’s. Bitmain’s Antminers — server-sized boxes filled with dozens or hundreds of identical high-powered chips — sell for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars and are typically bought in bulk by professional operators with access to cheap electricity. Bitmain is the industry’s “800-pound gorilla,” Roger Ver, the virtual currency proponent known as Bitcoin Jesus, said in an interview.\nWhile the company gets most of its revenue from mining equipment sales, it also runs some of the biggest mining collectives, in which members combine their processing capacity and split the rewards. Bitmain’s AntPool and BTC.com collectives control more than 40 percent of the world’s Bitcoin mining power, according to blockchain.info. The company’s outsized role has prompted a backlash from some virtual currency purists, who disdain anything that hints of a concentration of power in the crypto ecosystem. But Wu brushes off the naysayers, pointing out that lots of rivals are angling to grab market share. “Bitmain is trying very hard to maintain its advantage,” he said.\nStiff competition would be just one of several risks for investors in a potential Bitmain IPO. This year’s tumble in cryptocurrency prices has squeezed mining-industry profits, while the number of mine-able Bitcoins is creeping ever closer to its 21 million limit. Bitmain may be diversifying, but a successful push into AI is far from guaranteed, according to Mark Li, a senior analyst at Bernstein who says Bitmain is likely worth less than $10 billion.\nDespite the headwinds, a Bitmain offering would garner plenty of attention from Hong Kong investors, who lack compelling options to bet on China’s nascent chip industry, according to Kevin Wang, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. “They’ll have a premium for their valuation because there are very few” stocks like Bitmain in Hong Kong, Wang said. “But the sustainability of the business is the question mark.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "micree zhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nvidia corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T17:41:37.006+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 31208, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=1000", "requestsLeft": 652}
