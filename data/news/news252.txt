Joel Greenberg “The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options,” said Greenberg. “BitPay was started because we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale,” said Jeremie Beaudry, head of compliance at BitPay. “With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.”\nEarlier this year, lawmakers in Arizona, Wyoming, and Georgia all proposed similar bills to allow citizens to pay state taxes in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

On Max 29, iExec is slated to release its V2, which is comprised of a decentralized marketplace for the trading of cloud resources. Explains Bendella:\nOnce V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nWhat do you think about smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain?

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

You will be mining as long as Mozilla Firefox is open.\n- What can I do if mining is blocked?\nYour security system (antivirus, adblocker and etc. ) probably blocked mining script money.js. You need to add CryptoTab or money.js to whitelist in your security system. Find «exceptions» or «whitelist» item in the menu of your security system and add money.js and Cryptotab.net to it. You can search more information exactly about your antivirus specifics in internet.\n- How long does it take before I can withdraw?\nIt depends on how often you keep Firefox open on a daily basis, but the minimum recommended withdrawal is 0.001 BTC, which usually only takes a few months to achieve.\n- How can I be sure that you really do payments?\nAll transfers of funds confirmed in Bitcoin blockchain transaction database and available to check.

Those who were not planning to do so said it was mostly (40%) either superfluous to their requirements or they simply weren’t interested. “This reason is followed by 35.02% who say that the risk is too high, 27.04% who find it too difficult to understand and 17.97% who say it’s a scam,” Finder adds. Previous comments by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that Bitcoin was a “fraud” threatened to bring the concept into mainstream consciousness as a de facto ‘truth’ in September 2017, but Dimon subsequently took back his words. EARLY DAYS FOR BITCOIN The results reaffirm what many already know to be true about the current state of cryptocurrency: consumer adoption is still far out, with financial institutions due to adopt the technology long before the average citizen. Last month, Bitcoinist reported on how a Thomson Reuters survey revealed some more surprising numbers in this respect: 20% of finance firms were planning a crypto market entry, with over 50 of the 400 participants planning to complete theirs before the end of 2018. Despite a push to formalize markets from multiple jurisdictions this year, and those such as Japan actively encouraging consumer uptake, most are still distanced from cryptocurrency. To tip the balance for US consumers, it would appear Bitcoin, as the most popular cryptocurrency owned by survey respondents, must overcome barriers involving “bubble” fears, ease-of-use and fees. “While plenty of crypto proponents might disagree, 16.12% are waiting for what they think is a bubble to burst. A further 11.40% find it too difficult to use, and 5.75% think that there are too many fees involved,” Finder reveals.

Dorsey: ‘We Could be in Every App Store Instead of Five’\nJack Dorsey, the founder and CEO of Square and the co-founder and CEO of social media platform Twitter, was speaking at the Consensus conference today in New York.\n“The internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.”\nDorsey is of the opinion that the use of the number one digital currency or another altcoin as a global payment would lower the barrier for the payment company to enter new markets, reports CNBC. He added:\n“If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.”\nHe stated that as the company deals with fiat currency it had to approach the market differently, find a unique banking partner, and work with different regulators.\nThis isn’t the first time that Dorsey has been bullish on the future of Bitcoin. In March, it was reported that the Square CEO said that he believed the digital currency would become the globally accepted ‘single currency‘ of the Internet within the next 10 years.\nIn November, Square began the introduction of Bitcoin buying and selling options on Square Cash, the mobile payment app developed by Square, for a small section of their users. Since then the payment company has rolled out additional features for its users, which now sees them able to buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin with the app. Dorsey has also committed personal funds to Lightning Labs as the team continues its work on the Bitcoin scaling proposal known as the Lightning Network.\nEarlier today it was reported that Square Cash is growing at a faster rate compared to PayPal’s Venmo, according to Nomura Instinet. Analyst Dan Dolev said that with the roughly 28 million downloads, the number of Square Cash downloads was just one million fewer than Venmo’s levels.\nIn a note to clients, Dolev stated that:\n“Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017.”\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Square reportedly sold $34.1 million in Bitcoin; however, it spent $33.9 million purchasing the cryptocurrency, meaning it’s adjusted revenue amounted to $200,000.

That's the total sale amount of Bitcoin to customers.\nBut adjusted revenue from Bitcoin during the period was $200,000. That's Square's Bitcoin sales to app users, minus the cost of purchasing the digital currency.\nSquare stock jumped 3.6% to close at 56.59 on the stock market today .

Two recent examples are Coinbase’s new institutional focus and Nomura’s new venture. These stories, and much more, are in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: NY Regulator Approves Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and Litecoin Trading Coinbase Goes After Big Money\nCoinbase, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange recently valued at $8 billion , has announced a new suite of services meant to attract more big money players such as the many new crypto hedge funds that pop up all the time. It will launch a cryptocurrency custodian in partnership with an SEC-regulated broker-dealer to a group of initial clients that include 1confirmation, Autonomous Partners, Boost VC, Meta Stable, Multicoin Capital, Polychain Capital, Scalar Capital and Walden Bridge Capital.\nNew offerings also include Coinbase Prime, a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions, and an institutional coverage group headquartered in New York City to provide a higher level of service to these type of clients. “There is clear demand from institutional clients and financial services professionals for more specific solutions with regard to cryptocurrencies that address their sophisticated needs,” said Adam White, Vice President and General Manager of Coinbase Institutional.\nThe company will also be opening a new engineering office in Chicago to continue developing Coinbase Markets, which provides a centralized pool of liquidity for all its products. Over the course of the year it is promised to introduce new features like low latency performance, on-premise data-center co-location services, institutional connectivity and access, and settlement and clearing services. “As a global leader in financial technology, Chicago welcomes innovative companies investing in our city and creating jobs for Chicago residents,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “There is no better city than Chicago for companies that want to put down roots and grow their businesses.” Komainu to Protect Mutual Funds\nKomainu is a new venture established to help overcome barriers for institutional investment in crypto-assets with a custody solution and offering new services, standards and best practices. Its founders include Tokyo-headquartered global investment bank Nomura (NYSE: NMR), hardware wallet developer Ledger , and Global Advisors, parent company of Coinshares .\nJez Mohideen, Global Chief Digital Officer at Nomura, said: “Global investment managers have long been held back from full participation in digital asset markets, limited by operational and regulatory risk. Our new partnership will set the required standards that will bring peace of mind to digital asset investors, and provide tools and products to enable better integration with more traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds.” Jean-Marie Mognetti, Co-Principal of Global Advisors, added: “After 6 years of research, and collaboration with our administration partner and its regulator, we now have demonstrable progress. This partnership is a progressive stepping stone towards the creation of the necessary prerequisites for further growth within the digital asset ecosystem. This will open new and exciting opportunities to global participants and contribute to move digital asset closer to mainstream offerings.” Ledgerx Savings Accounts\nLedgerx, the CFTC-regulated cryptocurrency management platform, has launched a new savings account-like product. Ledger Savings uses an underlying call overwrite strategy but offers a simple interface so that users won’t need to know anything about investing in derivatives. It targets a 16% per annum yield with a potential 2x exit at maturity in the event BTC doubles from current spot prices. For launch, the savings product will be offered for 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month maturities, at varied rates. After selecting the product for the desired maturity, the USD amount is available immediately to withdraw but the associated BTC is locked for the duration of the savings product. Rat Poison Squared Fashion\nIf there is one thing that’s true for the cryptoverse, is that it is full of fast moving entrepreneurs. Warren Buffett only bashed bitcoin as “ rat poison squared ” less than two weeks ago, and someone has already found a way to make money from the now infamous glib. Ecoinmerce, a tokenized e-commerce marketplace, has announced the Rat Poison Squared clothing line, to include t-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, and keyrings.\n“We don’t know exactly what ‘rat poison squared’ is supposed to mean,” said Ecoinmerce COO Rex Chen. “What we do know is that Bitcoin created a very productive ecosystem and spawned the entire cryptocurrency revolution, which is driving innovation in nearly every industry. This clothing line is intended to give Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts pride in their defiance of the status quo and their belief in a better future.” Telegram’s Gram Lawsuit\nWith a seemingly endless torrent of new ICO tokens flooding the market, short and pithy names for these crypto-assets are running out fast. This can lead to people registering coin names just to try and flip them for profit later and to companies to wage battles over who gets to control a certain ticker, as happens with website domain names. The latest example for this is Telegram, which is now reportedly suing a Florida-based venture over the rights to ‘gram’. Did Jennifer Aniston Convince You to Invest in Crypto?\nThe Texas Securities Commissioner has issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order on May 15 to stop Wind Wide Coin Inc., from fraudulently offering investments in a cryptocurrency trading program. The order alleges that Wind Wide Coin and three sales agents in Houston are offering for sale investments in a cryptocurrency trading program that uses an “automatic trading bot.” The company is promising investors the combination of “no risk” and extraordinarily high returns. The purchase of 0.1 of BTC, for example, will yield 1 BTC 24 hours later, a one-day return of 900%.\nFurther according to the order, Wind Wide Coin is also misleading potential investors by claiming it is a “licensed company” and “legally registered.” And to lure gullible suckers the company’s website has featured endorsements from supposed past investors. To weed out anyone with some common sense, the website used images of celebrities like Jennifer Anniston – which it mistakenly identified as “Kate Jennifer,” an investor. Similarly, a photo of Prince Charles was identified as “Mark Robert,” an investor who provided a testimonial. The same testimonial was then attributed verbatim to a “Johnson Smith,” supposedly another UK investor.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Square Inc's decision to allow users of its mobile app to buy and sell bitcoin this year was a \"pretty contentious move within the company\" and remains a source of internal tension, the payment processor's CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday.\nSpeaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc , reiterated his support for the virtual coin, but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board.\n\"We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology,\" Dorsey said. \"There is still a lot of skepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.\"\nHe added that the \"healthy discussion\" around bitcoin extended \"all the way at the board level\", without elaborating on specifics.\nIn January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin.\nThe company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.\nProponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply.\nBut it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility, slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability.\nThe volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets. The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna irrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mix-fm square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:39:25.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08535c7920848ae07c8827a7120c140cbc591a90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqe7sPT4WJRu2.XF8fwXfuTWdQklP0YaMfOjlLIteMfYxgQrLEdPZYx.NERBRYU8VCISe32TupJptKB0YE56UeOp5A1WR0COxxBQ_GkiqAFu2ZKYprVG9D1", "site_full": "global-news-views.news", "site": "global-news-views.news", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Square's bitcoin move has caused internal disagreement: CEO Dorsey | Global News Views", "title_full": "Square's bitcoin move has caused internal disagreement: CEO Dorsey | Global News Views", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08535c7920848ae07c8827a7120c140cbc591a90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqe7sPT4WJRu2.XF8fwXfuTWdQklP0YaMfOjlLIteMfYxgQrLEdPZYx.NERBRYU8VCISe32TupJptKB0YE56UeOp5A1WR0COxxBQ_GkiqAFu2ZKYprVG9D1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square's bitcoin move has caused internal disagreement: CEO Dorsey | Global News Views", "text": "GNV Square Inc’s decision to allow users of its mobile app to buy and sell bitcoin this year was a “pretty contentious move within the company” and remains a source of internal tension, the payment processor’s CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday.

Market visualization from Coin360\nAfter losing the $9,000 support on May 11, Bitcoin (BTC) continued its fall, now approaching the $8,000 level. Having lost almost 3 percent of its value in 24 hours to press time, the original cryptocurrency is currently trading at $8,288 . Despite this most recent fall, Bitcoin has seen over 3 percent gains over the last 30 days, according to Cointelegraph Price Index .\nBitcoin price chart.

The coins are currently trading at $12.31 and $0.329 respectively.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is down almost 7 percent over a one-day period, trading at $1,269 at press time. Yesterday, May 15, BCH implemented a hard fork that increased its block size from 8MB to 32MB and reactivated Bitcoin script operation codes (Op codes) – an upgrade, which has so far apparently failed to produce a positive effect on the price.\nThe decline in crypto markets coincided with the recent decision by Microsoft -owned search engine Bing to join the ranks of other internet giants in banning crypto-related ads from its network by July 2018.\nCryptocurrencies also came under criticism by European financial authorities. Monday, May 14, European Central Bank (ECB) board member Yves Mersch claimed that banks should “segregate” their dealings in cryptocurrencies from other activities, citing high volatility of crypto markets and stressing that digital tokens “do not qualify as money.”\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph ethereum price index total", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph price index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:24:45.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b83dfa6ae67287058107e2e29c0b99580021777", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRVfjSAcqoxaTQv2nEHDqKAc9xzej0E_yNwiAL9VwTAeDqV1IrhB62AUjqhPWbXgOdnMwqW1fZ3lg--", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/04/17062358/techanalysis-btc3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b83dfa6ae67287058107e2e29c0b99580021777", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRVfjSAcqoxaTQv2nEHDqKAc9xzej0E_yNwiAL9VwTAeDqV1IrhB62AUjqhPWbXgOdnMwqW1fZ3lg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By Sarah Jenn | May 16, 2018 | 4:50 am Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By Sarah Jenn | May 16, 2018 | 4:50 am\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price continues to slide and is cruising inside a descending channel on the 1-hour chart. Price is approaching the bottom of this channel but it might not be strong enough to keep losses at bay. Oscillators are hinting at a bounce but moving averages suggest a break.\nBitcoin price could be due for a test of the descending channel bottom, which might still give way if bears stay strong.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is still to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA is also in line with the channel resistance to add to its strength as a ceiling.\nHowever, RSI is starting to pull up from the oversold level to signal a return in buying momentum. Similarly, stochastic is indicating oversold conditions so sellers might allow bulls to take over from here. If so, a bounce off the $8000 level could be in order, spurring a move to the $8400-8500 channel top.\n= BTC/USD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nInvestors seem to be holding out for more positive bitcoin updates before reestablishing their long positions, and it looks like the expected selling of Mt. Gox bitcoin is keeping bears in play.\nRecall that the exchange has yet to liquidate most of its bitcoin holdings in order to pay off creditors, and this selling pressure could lead to more losses for bitcoin price from here. It doesn’t help that geopolitical risk and dollar demand are also in place.\nThe dollar shrugged off weak April retail sales as investors focused on the pickup in underlying prices and the positive revision to March data. This has allowed US bond yields to tick higher on revived tightening prospects, lifting the dollar across the board in the process.

As it stands now, consumers can use Bitcoin across a number of industries to purchase everything from real estate, to PCs, to pizza. However, Bitcoin’s high transaction costs, deflationary nature, and full transparency represent some of the shortcomings that prevent Bitcoin from seeing widespread merchant adoption.\nAs such, enthusiasts, consumers, and producers alike have gotten behind a number of altcoins as mediums of exchange for a variety of uses. While Bitcoin acted as the catalyst for the first wave of crypto-merchant integration, these emerging altcoins are the pioneers for the interactions between the consumers and merchants of tomorrow. Privacy Coins\nOne cryptocurrency niche seeing steady and increasing consumer activity is privacy coins. There exist a number of situations where anonymous transactions are optimal for the consumer or producer. The obvious example is the use of Monero (XMR) to power darknet markets – allowing buyers and sellers to agree upon the sale of drugs and other illicit goods in a completely anonymous, untraceable manner.\nHowever, black market sales do not wholly represent usage of privacy coins. Consumers have also flocked to privacy coins for usage in the adult industry . Monero has seen integration on sites selling sex toys. A number of privacy coins have also been integrated across various porn sites. With privacy coins, there is no paper trail – alleviating the risk of embarrassing or scandalous credit card statements being viewed by other parties. The nature of cryptocurrency also ensures that payments to any merchant will not jeopardize the information or payment details of the consumer.\nOf course, the recent Verge partnership represents the most prominent instance of adoption of privacy coins in the adult industry. Last month, Verge (XVG) unveiled a partnership with porn giant Pornhub.com, which will allow payments to the site to be made via XVG. Although much controversy has ensued, this partnership pins Verge as a pioneer for privacy coin adoption. Other Instances\nOutside of privacy coins, a number of other altcoins have also begun to see meaningful integrations. OmiseGo (OMG), a platform seeking to empower the unbanked and create an inclusive, massively scalable financial ecosystem, earned the spotlight when OMG was integrated by McDonald’s Thailand. As OmiseGo continues to expand its network, it’s predicted that other large corporations will integrate the cryptocurrency down the road.\nBeloved meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has also seen significant adoption. As the lighthearted and far-reaching community drove the joke coin to a powerhouse with a market cap of over US$500 million, community members and converted fans have driven Doge to be picked up by numerous merchants worldwide. One example that encapsulates the spirit of DOGE is this site for trendy pet accessories.\nOne upcoming project with a lot of potential is flogmall . Flogmall seeks to become a one-stop online shopping destination that accepts all cryptocurrencies. Of course, this will include KickCoin (KICK), the native token of the platform that’s responsible for crowdfunding the flogmall project, KICKICO.\nOf course, with the ever-increasing popularity and information surrounding cryptocurrency, it’s only logical that merchants and consumers worldwide will continue to make new transactions and relationships through cryptocurrency. The future of cryptocurrency in consumer settings is wildly exciting. About The Author jeffthebaker\nZane is a crypto enthusiast who has been involved since August 2013. He is a trader and writer of all things cryptocurrency. He is very excited for the role cryptocurrency will play in the future, especially in regards to the videogaming industry.

Bitcoin Risks Fall Below $8K After 3.5-Week Low NEWS Omkar Godbole May 16, 2018 at 13:00 UTC | Updated May 17, 2018 at 13:13 UTC\nBitcoin's (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices since Saturday and are now looking to pull the cryptocurrency below the $8,000 mark, the technical charts indicate.\nThe bears' comeback comes after bitcoin saw minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204, but the bulls repeatedly failed to cut through the key falling trendline hurdle. As a result, bitcoin fell to a 3.5-week low of $8,100 on Bitfinex earlier today.\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,366 - down 4.7 percent in 24 hours. Daily chart\nThe above chart shows that bitcoin has dipped below the 50-day moving average (MA), currently located at $8,290. As discussed yesterday , a close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal resumption of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and could yield deeper sell-off to $7,800.\nThe rejection at the descending trendline hurdle and a drop to $8,100 has reinforced the bearish view put forward by the short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day), which are sloping downwards in favor of the bears.\nThe retreat from $8,884 to $8,100 has also established a falling top (lower highs pattern) - a (you guessed it) bearish setup. While the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).\nAs a result, there is a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival. 4-hour chart\nThe bad news (for the bulls, at least) continues in the 4-hour chart. The downside break of the expanding channel (bearish breakdown) indicates the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed and could yield a drop to $7,524 (target as per the measured height method).\nNote, the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are sloping downwards (bearish). View BTC will likely close below $8,290 (50-day MA) today and confirm a bear revival. The cryptocurrency looks set to test support at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from April 1 low to May 5 high) and could go as low as $7,524 (expanding channel breakdown target) in the next 24-48 hours. An unexpected break above $8,884 would abort the bearish view.\nBear graffiti image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group. Goldman is not among the new round's investors.\nFive-year-old Circle's first product was designed for buying bitcoin and moving traditional money between individuals by using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nBut in the past year, its other business, facilitating big trades of digital currencies, has surged in volume and revenue.\nThat desk, called Circle Trade, says it has traded about $4 billion in the past month, handling trades from institutions, companies and wealthy individuals, Circle said. The company has said it generated $250 million in revenue from November to January.\nBy one measure, Circle is now the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency startup. Its $3 billion equity valuation surpasses that of Coinbase, which raised money at a $1.6 billion valuation late last year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\nCircle is one of a handful of so-called over-the-counter market makers who augment the smaller-value trades on exchanges, alongside such firms as Cumberland Mining. At least one big bank, Goldman, is exploring a role for itself in trading around cryptocurrencies.\nAs part of the funding, Bitmain will also join Circle's new project to launch new digital coins that can be exchanged for a fixed amount of traditional, or fiat, currency.\nJeremy Allaire, Circle's chief executive and co-founder, said the new coin and fundraising is part of the company's \"long-term vision for what's possible in building a new global economic system.\"\nCircle also recently acquired a digital asset exchange, Poloniex, and a retail investment application, now called Circle Invest.\nWrite to Telis Demos at [email protected]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "telis demos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital currency startup soars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle internet financial ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:25:18.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c1a2585aa5074e30619ee17914f43c82740a458", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9hZE4G6PcitJl2rGfPXTxtFnI.S1hqLEVShve05pvSNuxBVs722yVSoZv80EjIDhBLxPR4N.UvOX1M9u84xaS.k4GgzgXcwxyWf2B.c0MUz89lYAfViv_", "site_full": "theoutline.com", "site": "theoutline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin is consuming as much energy as the country of Ireland | The Outline", "title_full": "Bitcoin is consuming as much energy as the country of Ireland | The Outline", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.446, "main_image": "https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180516-WTQZNYAyGC022JlBUepQ?auto=format&q=60&w=1280&s=e652cb0231061a7274595f42edf112e1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c1a2585aa5074e30619ee17914f43c82740a458", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9hZE4G6PcitJl2rGfPXTxtFnI.S1hqLEVShve05pvSNuxBVs722yVSoZv80EjIDhBLxPR4N.UvOX1M9u84xaS.k4GgzgXcwxyWf2B.c0MUz89lYAfViv_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is consuming as much energy as the country of Ireland | The Outline", "text": "Bitcoin is consuming as much energy as the country of Ireland Ireland gives us whiskey, Bitcoin gives us... hmm. The Future 2.55 Jigawatts! The amount of energy Bitcoin is consuming, at the low end, every year; the same as the country of Ireland. The Future Bitcoin is consuming as much energy as the country of Ireland Ireland gives us whiskey, Bitcoin gives us... hmm. Paris Martineau May—16—2018 11:00AM EST\nIn addition to being insufferable, Bitcoin is also absolutely terrible for the environment. According to a letter published today in the energy journal Joule by financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, the Bitcoin network is consuming roughly 2.55 gigawatts of energy annually, at the absolute minimum. To put that in context, that’s nearly the same amount of energy consumed by the entirety of Ireland. That’s just the conservative current estimate; De Vries predicts that by December, the Bitcoin network could be using almost triple that.\nBitcoins cost energy to “mine,” because mining is just a computer running calculations; the longer Bitcoin is around, the more energy it takes to mine each subsequent unit (it takes four times as much energy to mine a single Bitcoin now as it did when the currency launched in 2009). There is a finite amount of Bitcoin, and the most recent projections show it will take about another 120 years to mine all 21 million Bitcoins. There is also, theoretically, a tipping point somewhere in there where the amount of energy it takes to mine a piece of Bitcoin is more valuable than the Bitcoin itself, though it all depends on the market value. But Bitcoin transactions, not just mining, take energy (one transaction could currently power a home for a week ), so the more widely used it is, the more carbon we are pumping into the atmosphere.\nThere’s been a considerable amount of debate over the last couple of years surrounding the extent of the energy impact of Bitcoin (for instance, is it pretty bad , or r eally really bad ?), not least because energy use in most parts of the world contributes carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. But in the wake of Bitcoin’s wild valuation ride throughout most of 2017 up to nearly $20,000 per coin, cryptocurrency mining doesn’t seem likely to slow down anytime soon. Researchers need concrete answers before it becomes far too late enact institutional restrictions and regulations on the practice, writes De Vries.\nDe Vries’ figure doesn’t even include the energy expenditures of other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Ripple . The altcoin market’s potential for comparably sky-high energy consumption levels is unfortunately all too serious. According to the Digiconomist’s Ethereum Energy Consumption Index (which is technically still in beta), Ethereum production already makes up .09 percent of the world’s total energy consumption. While this may seem like a relatively small amount, it’s not. It’s already more than the total yearly energy consumption of countries like Iceland, Jordan, and Cuba. And given that Ethereum is only just getting started (ugh), this figure will likely only rise.\nEnergy use of Bitcoin will likely stop growing so fast and even decline in the near future; Grist estimated that at current trends Bitcoin would cost as much energy as the whole world uses now in only two years, an incredibly unlikely situation. It may also be possible to improve mining algorithms so they don't use as much energy. Still, when the energy use is so high and interest isn’t waning , De Vries is trying to draw attention to the currency’s impact.\n\"We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed,” said de Vries in a press release. “Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris martineau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:34:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a6118be19dee75032fe038cb40a69f4a808cd77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pJ4AhKRzWnI9tQNZaiRXaSvjjrHN4v.YeqxSn8JH6P5yx5RC0WRLDtGmngXA0IbT1V4JPRKju.6hPe5YjqjaJQhluQg_xtFr0g--", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Uncovering the Real Cartel in Bitcoin – CryptoMedication – Medium", "title_full": "Uncovering the Real Cartel in Bitcoin – CryptoMedication – Medium", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*-Spkdoix3MFaXiSMWw7Bow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a6118be19dee75032fe038cb40a69f4a808cd77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pJ4AhKRzWnI9tQNZaiRXaSvjjrHN4v.YeqxSn8JH6P5yx5RC0WRLDtGmngXA0IbT1V4JPRKju.6hPe5YjqjaJQhluQg_xtFr0g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Uncovering the Real Cartel in Bitcoin – CryptoMedication – Medium", "text": "As the title of the article suggests, Phil Potter & Giancarlo Devasini, both listed as executives for Bitfinex, were revealed to also be in the executive structure of Tether as well. Went to verify this on the ICIJ website and they are indeed listed there. This was an association that they had previously denied for obvious reasons. You probably know from the work of Bitfinex’ed that this relationship was implicit in a number of ways based on the fact that Bitfinex was the primary trader of Tether tokens (and still is). Revelation II — Tether is Probably Being Used to Manipulate (Pump) USDT-Paired Altcoins, Not Bitcoin A lot of people think that Tether has been used to pump Bitcoin. On the contrary, I believe that the model for this changed after CME adoption (futures release in December). Rather than pumping Bitcoin, I believe that they decided to pump all of the other USDT traded pairs. I showed the relationship between the timing of Treasury transfers of Tether and ridiculous pumps of random coins that have been occurring since December. It is my firm belief that different USDT traded pair coins such as $XRP, $NEO, $LTC, $EOS, and several others have been pumped for the purposes of acquiring more Bitcoin. Once that’s acquired, they (Tether) use said Bitcoin to sell OTC (over the counter/not on an exchange/direct person to person). Or perhaps they merely sell this Bitcoin directly on exchanges after accumulating and this could potentially account for the way that BTC price has been subsequently drilled down since December. Here is the article where I covered this in full: — — — — — — — — Tether/Bitcoin Manipulation Expose — — — — — — — medium.com This could account for certain price increases in BTC after treasury transfers as well, because, rather than selling BTC for USD/USDT, investors would be selling it for $XRP or whatever coin that they’re pumping. Thus, the total number of BTC available on the sell side of the USD/USDT markets on the exchanges would be minimized and the basic principle of supply/demand tells us, with decreased supply, the price will increase. However, I could be completely wrong. Given the nature of distributed ledgers and exchanges, it’s virtually impossible to track the flow of currency once it hits an exchange and exchanges aren’t necessarily breaking their necks to provide any greater transparency on their trading activities. Revelation III — The Biggest Mistake Bitfinex+Tether Ever Made Was Asking Customers to Deposit Euros to a Shell Bank Account This crucial mistake is what has allowed journalists like myself to venture all the way through to the furthest depths of this rabbit hole. This article here is very important — Bitcoin's biggest exchange, Bitfinex, which currently handles around half a billion in bitcoin trading volumes, has… www.trustnodes.com This article was written in November of 2017. It didn’t get too much attention at that point in time, but it is deadly important right now, in my opinionl for a few reasons. The headline of this article is “Bitfinex Reveals a New Polish Bank Account Under a Panama Registered Company” . Now, this article was released at a time when there was great speculation about Bitfinex’s banking because Wells Fargo had dissolved their relationship with them around mid-2017. Here’s an article about this from the New York Times SAN FRANCISCO - As the price of Bitcoin has soared, the virtual currency has edged toward the mainstream. Square, the… www.nytimes.com Revelation III — Tether is Bogus, Undeniably In my opinion, this is something that should really be beyond dispute at this point, but there are still naysayers in the community. So, it is my hopes that this ‘Revelation’ section will provide a compelling case for why Tether is bogus and, by association, Bitfinex as well. So, after the Wells Fargo partnership with Bitfinex was dissolved by Wells Fargo promptly (we still don’t have a specific reason from the bank itself), the major concern in the community and, apparently from Bitfinex too, was whether Bitfinex would be able to continue doing business and most notably, whether Tethers could continue to be issued. This entire saga began in March 2017, when the news initially broke that Wells Fargo was discontinuing any and all banking agreements with the company, Bitfinex, leaving their accounts essentially frozen. In April 2017, Bitfinex decided to strike back with a lawsuit against Wells Fargo: Source: https://www.scribd.com/document/344831470/1-main It’s worth noting that in this complaint against Wells Fargo, it was stated, “Wells Fargo’s suspension of U.S. dollar wire transfers also is interfering with plaintiffs’ ability to conduct business , such as their ability to pay employees and suppliers .” So, in the words of Bitfinex themselves, this action by Wells Fargo essentially compromised their ability to remain solvent. What’s even more interesting is the fact that they defined the ‘parties’ in this case in a way that depicted Tether as an entity that operated independently from iFinex (parent company of Bitfinex), which isn’t necessarily untrue (two people can own two different, unrelated companies), but it does border heavily on dishonesty and perhaps even perjury due to a failure to accurate disclose the apparent ties between the two businesses. This lines up with this exposé by an observant Twitter user a few months ago: As we all know, Bitfinex eventually withdrew their lawsuit against Wells Fargo. In my opinion, this wasn’t a ‘sudden’ decision and the motivation behind doing so is probably the same reason why they have never followed through with a lawsuit against the user Bitfinex’ed , whom they publicly threatened to sue a few months ago as well — the discovery process. In the United States, whenever one entity attempts to sue another, for any reason, there is something called ‘discovery’. This is a process where any and all relevant documents/bank records/statements/transactions/tax returns/company information/and even personal correspondence such as e-mails or text messages must be turned over to opposing counsel (the other side’s legal team) so that they can build a cogent defense/offense. As you can imagine, if your business isn’t operating above board, the results of such a process would be devastating , to say the least. Let’s jump forward a few months in time to August 2017. Source: https://hackernoon.com/the-curious-tale-of-tethers-6b0031eead87 In the above excerpt, which was published on August 7th, 2017, by Bitfinex’ed in Hackernoon, the dilemma poised by the public withdrawal of banking support by Wells Fargo was epitomized well. The statement, “Tether [ the company ] claimed that the supply of tethers [USDT tokens] would not increase until their banking problem was solved…” is corroborated by this archived press release from the company Source: http://archive.is/6DDZS#selection-717.0-717.235 Tether, an online, digital token that claimed that each token issued was backed by an actual U.S. dollar in reserve in order to preserve it’s ‘peg’ was in serious jeopardy of losing all of its value given the fact that the no-bank situation would prevent the company from accepting anymore wire transfers of fiat in exchange for Tethers. As if things couldn’t get any worse, both companies, Tether and Bitfinex, were rocked with a subpoena in December (the actual news was released on January 30th by Bloomberg): U.S. regulators are scrutinizing one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges as questions mount over a digital… www.bloomberg.com Excerpt from the article So, this created a situation where Bitfinex+Tether essentially lost any and all legitimate banking partnerships and came under federal scrutiny within the space of approximately 7 months. Purchases of Tether have been closed off to the general public for almost a full calendar year now at the time of writing and Bitfinex has just recently opened their website to accept new exchange accounts again (which was spontaneously closed on December 21st — odd timing, right?). Yet, despite this, Tether has printed an additional +$2 billion in tokens in just the last year alone and claims that each one of these tokens are backed by real U.S. dollars, 1:1. This is in spite of the fact that the company has no verifiable form of income, published audits, or any other accounting forms/reports/documents/financial statements that would yield any credence to the plausibility that these tokens are backed 1:1 with U.S. dollars. Fortunately, for those that have had trouble keeping track of Treasury printouts, Paste Magazine has done a phenomenal job in a comprehensive article they published recently on the saga.

The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nThe tokens will be based on Ethereum’s ERC20 standard and developed and governed by CENTRE , a foundation that will manage a collection of new, fiat-backed tokens. CENTRE is a wholly owned subsidiary of Circle, but Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the foundation would become more independent as other members joined.\nAlongside Circle and Bitmain, other CENTRE members will be able to produce their own fiat-based stablecoins and help set rules around how the coins will operate. According to the CENTRE’s whitepaper , governance of the network will include a type of voting that will leverage a forthcoming CENTRE-specific token that is separate from fiat tokens.\nThe way Circle sees it, a price-stable token is critical for enabling mainstream adoption of blockchain technology for payments and supporting financial contracts built on smart contract platforms, such as those for controlling token securities, loans and property.\nCircle’s new stable token joins a growing list of stable tokens meant to ease volatility of cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly in value over even a few hours. Tether (USDT), introduced in 2015 , is the biggest of the stablecoins, with about $2.2 billion in circulating supply .\nCircle made news earlier this year when it purchased cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. Circle plans to offer USDC through Poloniex. It will also incorporate USDC in its social payments app and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin news bitmain leads circle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain leads circle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general catalyst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breyer capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usdc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T16:28:46.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e94e3af2df709961b9a6c029ca7955634530cf01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVqIJukZDuIL4oC9zRPBsLrL4CTR9yELsY71iFknKLoGCn_uVqqMtPAx9X835WeCeNPUF.s0W37r5Ag8.iSqszFQ--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Federal Reserve Pres: People Want Dollar, Not Volatile Crypto - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Federal Reserve Pres: People Want Dollar, Not Volatile Crypto - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.243, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/St-Louis-Fed.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e94e3af2df709961b9a6c029ca7955634530cf01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVqIJukZDuIL4oC9zRPBsLrL4CTR9yELsY71iFknKLoGCn_uVqqMtPAx9X835WeCeNPUF.s0W37r5Ag8.iSqszFQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "C.

That a top US economic policy maker was in attendance is victory enough; however, he was asked his opinions on cryptocurrency going forward by CNBC Global Markets Reporter Seema Mody. He explained he found the phenomenon “interesting,” and how more cryptos being issued all time necessitates keeping an “eye” on them. Mr. Bullard also compared the use case for cryptocurrencies with that of the dollar, and whether the former posed a threat to the latter.\nAlso read: Bitpay Enables Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) for Tax Payments Federal Reserve President Attends Crypto Conference\nFederal Reserve President, James Bullard, gave a presentation at this year’s giant Consensus conference in New York City. Reread that sentence. A sitting Fed policy maker thought it important enough to attend a crypto soiree. That’s news enough. But more importantly, President Bullard gave a presentation on the government’s current thinking about cryptocurrency.\nIn his talk, he acknowledged crypto is facilitating trade that might otherwise not occur. He couldn’t help himself by mentioning illegal activity (and we all know fiat currencies are never used in illegal activity), but he did describe decentralized money’s lean toward frictionless transactions (especially with regard to costs/fees) as being an advancement. Mr. Bullard and Ms. Mody\nThe Fed policy maker reserved the bulk of his comments, both in the presentation and during a post-game interview with CNBC, to talk about the problems in crypto as he sees them. One issue is simply the number of currencies being offered. The 12th St. Louis Fed President feels this over complicates matters, especially with regard to exchange rates and volatility.\nAsked if cryptocurrencies pose a threat to the dollar, Mr. Bullard, 56, answered he didn’t think so. Global Markets Reporter Seema Mody, who is covering Consensus for CNBC this year, quickly followed up with a “but it could be?” The Fed President was noncommittal, choosing instead to shrug and give the pat answer about no one really knowing what the future holds. He emphasized how since its creation the US dollar has vanquished nearly all currency competition due to its being backed by the world’s strongest economy. It’s abundantly clear, Mr. Bullard suggested, people want the dollar and not crypto … at least at the moment. Fed Coin on the Horizon?\nMs. Mody pressed Mr. Bullard about his presence at the conference, asking if this was a hint of things to come with regard to a future coin birthed by the Fed, a Fed Coin? Interestingly he didn’t dismiss the idea outwardly, and instead said they’d for sure look at the possibility, as the Fed does with many different types of financial innovations. He also assured there wasn’t any plan being hatched at the moment, no imminent Fed Coin coming. Mr. Bullard also wondered aloud what the gains would be by creating such a coin. He smiled subtly, assuring he’s keeping an “open mind.”\nHis comments seem to be less strident than statements issued by the St. Louis Fed on the very subject not even one month ago. “The St. Louis Federal Reserve has published an essay critically evaluating the notion of cryptocurrencies that are issued by central banks,” we detailed . “The article is highly dismissive in presenting what it describes as ‘the non-case for central bank cryptocurrencies,’ concluding that ‘a central bank will not issue cryptocurrencies in the sense of a truly decentralized and permissionless asset that allows users to remain anonymous.’”\nA rather curious fact about the St. Louis Fed, one of twelve jurisdictions in the Federal Reserve system (the 8th district serves Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas), is how it has recently become very chatty about crypto. As these pages reported back at the beginning of this year, “Aleksander Berentsen and Fabian Schär of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis have recently published an article that emphasizes many of the benefits of cryptocurrencies. The article states that ‘cryptoassets are well suited to become an important asset class,’ in addition to offering praise regarding a number of the major applications associated with cryptocurrencies.”\nDo you think a Fed president attending a crypto conference is meaningful?

The billionaire reiterated his earlier warning that “cryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.”\n“If you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it’s a couple tenths of a percent.”\nMr. Buffett previously said buying crypto isn’t really investing, but is merely speculative gambling, according to CNN. He said unlike real estate or company stocks, virtual currencies have no real value and only attract “charlatans.”‘\n“If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything,” said Buffett, 87. “You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.”\nIn his recent comment on the digital currencies, Buffett stepped further by calling bitcoin “rat poison squared,” according to CNBC reporter Becky Quick, who live-tweeted the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting.\nBuffett’s longtime lieutenant, billionaire Charlie Munger, joined the bitcoin bashing, comparing the top cryptocurrency by market cap to turds being traded by people with dementia.\n“I like cryptocurrency even less than Warren does … to me it’s just dementia,” Mr. Munger, 94, reportedly said. And a bitcoin trading desk is “like somebody else is trading turds and you’re being left out.”\nWhile Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger remain avowed crypto sceptics, Mr. Draper, PayPal co-founder is so confident in the future of crypto that he has set a $250,000 bitcoin price target for 2022.\nMr. Draper, an early investor in Skype, Tesla, and Hotmail, says bitcoin will be bigger than all three combined because it’s a revolution that’s bigger than the Internet.\n“This is bigger than the internet,” the PayPal boss said. “It’s bigger than the Iron Age, the Renaissance. It’s bigger than the Industrial Revolution. This affects the entire world and it’s going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you ever imagined.” (Visited 2 times, 2 visits today) Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

Every week a handful of tokens enjoy the “Binance bounce”, gaining as much as 50% in a matter of hours. Trueusd (TUSD) was meant to be different though. It’s a stablecoin whose job is to stay as close to the US dollar as possible. And yet, when Binance announced that it was adding TUSD, the unthinkable happened.\nAlso read: Circle Raises $110Mn With Plans to Launch USD-Backed Coin How Trueusd Became a False Stablecoin\nStablecoins are a burgeoning industry, with scores of projects seeking to create tether alternatives that provide stability, each pegged against the US dollar. Circle has just announced plans to launch its own stablecoin, and news.Bitcoin.com recently profiled several other new contenders, including Trueusd, which was described as:\nA collateralized stablecoin backed by USD held in escrow accounts. It’s basically a more transparent tether and is available on Upbit and Bittrex – where it’s even tradable against tether.\nOn May 16, Binance became the latest and largest exchange to announce its intention to list TUSD. Up until this date, the coin had performed as expected, with scarcely a wobble from its dollar peg. But then Binance released its news and TUSD went on a run to rival even the pumpiest of altcoins. At 3:36am ET, Trueusd was trading at $0.997. In the space of 22 minutes, it jumped to $1.18 and by 5am was at $1.39, a 39% rise for a coin whose defining characteristic is that isn’t meant to rise. Stability? What Stability?\nIn a short blog post , Binance declared that it would “open trading for TUSD/BNB, TUSD/BTC and TUSD/ETH trading pairs at 2018/05/18 04:00 AM (UTC). Users can now start depositing TUSD in preparation for trading.” It added: “Note: TUSD is a stablecoin. The value is designed to be 1 TUSD = 1 USD.” That design clearly doesn’t account for the power of a Binance listing. This is despite Trust Token, the team behind TUSD, claiming “Our open source smart contracts ensure a 1:1 parity between TrueUSD and USD in the accounts.”\nIronically, in pumping by 39%, TUSD may have just proven its unsuitability as a stablecoin, and strengthened the case for tether. Tether may be opaque, but at least it works, staying resolutely close to its dollar peg at all times. Trueusd seems to have spiked due to traders FOMO-ing into the coin. It is unclear whether all of these buyers were aware that they were purchasing a supposed stablecoin. The price will settle down eventually, and return to its designated price.

In it, Alex de Vries, a financial economist and blockchain specialist, carefully worked through a number of known data points — the number of bitcoin-mining computers made in the past year, the energy consumption of those computers and the minimum energy costs of cooling large facilities of tightly packed computers, among others — to arrive at an absolute lowest bound for the energy consumption of the bitcoin network today: 2.55 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Ireland.\nBy the end of 2018, de Vries calculated, based on data about ongoing bitcoin mining production, that number could rise to 7.67 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Austria. And that, he said in a statement , amounts to about 0.5 percent of the world's energy consumption.\nThis is a problem for several reasons, environmental concerns among them. But de Vries showed that it represents a particular problem for the bitcoin miners themselves: It could soon be so expensive to mine bitcoin that the process simply stops being profitable. [ Top 10 Emerging Environmental Technologies ]\nWhy is bitcoin sucking up all this energy ? To understand that, you have to know a little about how the bitcoin network works.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. That means there's no central agency that records who owns what. Instead, bitcoin users rely on a shared, time-stamped digital record of their transactions. And maintaining that shared record, adding a \"block\" to it every 10 minutes or so, is the work of a competitive effort by thousands of computers all over the world. Those computers collectively perform quintillions of calculations per second, each \"mining,\" trying to solve a math problem that will give it the right to form the next block on the chain. And the winner every 10 minutes is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins. That's more than $100,000 at the coin's current exchange rates.\nGiven those incentives, bitcoin miners have filled up warehouses with computers devoted to mining. Those computers, even the most efficient ones, need a significant amount of power to run. Certain details, like how many of these computers actually get made per year, or what tricks different mining operations use to keep them cool, are industry secrets. But de Vries worked around that secretiveness to find the data he needed for his calculation.\n\"[This calculation] marks the first time that bitcoin miner production has been estimated with the help of upstream [chip] production numbers,\" he wrote. \"Given the ongoing secrecy of bitcoin miner manufacturers, this could prove to be a valuable addition to the toolkit for substantiating trends in bitcoin's electricity consumption.\"\nDe Vries also pointed out that when bitcoin mining becomes more costly than profitable, that doesn't mean all the bitcoin miners will stop. Some miners, he pointed out, might steal electricity or otherwise figure out ways to mine bitcoin at no personal cost. For example, he said, one researcher mined $8,000 to $10,000 worth of bitcoin on a university supercomputer , costing the university about $150,000. Other, less-nefarious miners, he wrote, might keep mining for reasons like anonymity or libertarian ideology.\nStill, de Vries wrote, bitcoin's potential to become so energy-hungry that it stops being profitable is a real threat to the network.\nOriginally published on Live Science .

Referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core Ver said the software is “ slow, expensive and unreliable .”\nVer who is CEO of Bitcoin.com a website which guides investors in the cryptocurrency market told the host of Fast Money that innovative business are being built with Bitcoin Cash in mind “ because it actually works .” He continued on the show to say:\n“All of these existing businesses are building their new products on top of bitcoin cash, the economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that lead to bitcoin’s original success,” BCH Hard Fork Brings no Relief From Sliding Price\nBitcoin Cash beat other large-cap currencies in the last month like Ethereum and Bitcoin to be the best performing coin even though it has been on a steady decline leading up to the May 15 fork.\nTrading at a low today of $1,250 according to livecoinwatch.com, BCH is down considerably from its recent high of $1,754 on May 6 but still almost double it’s April 17 low of $763 when Brian Kelly of BKCM said it would make a comeback within the year.\nTuesday’s hard fork introduced several changes to the network which included an increase of the maximum block size to 32 MB which allows as many as 61 transactions per second to occur. However it didn’t generate an uptick in price during the lead up to it.\nJust the opposite has happened in fact, BCH has lost around 12% in the 24 hours since the fork. Why? Because this latest fork offered no benefits to those who already own BCH. Traditionally a fork would reward currency holders by doubling their amount of equivalent coins. Holders would retain their original investment and receive the same amount on the new blockchain. With this fork, holder’s coins will simply be moved to the new blockchain at the same value.\nVer isn’t put off by Tuesday’s decline though and has even predicted that Bitcoin Cash will double in price by years end. As he told CNBC;\n“ That’s what actually gives it it’s underlying value, that you can use it in commerce to pay for things. Whereas, a lot of these other tokens out there just kind of turn into speculative assets that don’t actually have any utility .”\nImage from Shutterstock “Bitcoin Jesus” Still Bullish on Bitcoin Cash After Hard Fork was last modified: May 16th, 2018 by John McMahon ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcmahon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:46:15.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa38744084854ea6439a17d908cf084ff6767a54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jkcEqsAojXtvuMeuNDMNKHrJf6U6RlY2FcD5sjV9zGORvlR0gSdwqYQu53ehS_ev4r7YQslxUwxylyhBHD1O9IA--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why Are More Governments Stopping Bitcoin Mining Operations? - The Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Why Are More Governments Stopping Bitcoin Mining Operations? - The Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoinmining-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa38744084854ea6439a17d908cf084ff6767a54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jkcEqsAojXtvuMeuNDMNKHrJf6U6RlY2FcD5sjV9zGORvlR0gSdwqYQu53ehS_ev4r7YQslxUwxylyhBHD1O9IA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Are More Governments Stopping Bitcoin Mining Operations? - The Bitcoin News", "text": "Why Are More Governments Stopping Bitcoin Mining Operations? May 16, 2018 161\nBitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many people in the cryptocurrency community. Despite the increasing popularity of bitcoin mining around the globe, though, there are quite a few places where it’s illegal. In another recent article , we looked at where bitcoin mining is currently being prohibited. In this article, we’ll look at a few different cases to get a better picture of exactly why more governments are shutting down these operations. China\nIn many nations, owning and/or trading cryptocurrency has officially been banned. However, these rulings haven’t necessarily led to a shutdown of bitcoin mining. China is one of the few countries that has imposed nation-wide bans on both trading and mining.\nBefore the bitcoin mining ban was announced earlier this year , China accounted for more than 70% of the world’s bitcoin mining operations. Mining statistics aren’t available post-ban, so it’s difficult to tell the overall impact of the ban as of this writing. There have been a few coordinated raids, including one in April 2018 in Tianjin where 600 mining computers and eight high-power fans were seized .\nChinese officials are formulating strategies on how to shut down mining operations. This was made evident by leaked documents released earlier in 2018. According to an article published by Vice , “In the documents, issued to the local offices of the internet-finance regulator, authorities were instructed to force mining operations out of business using measures linked to electricity pricing, land use, tax and environmental protection.”\nEnvironmental factors are important to consider as a legitimate reason for the bitcoin mining ban in China. While annual carbon emissions growth in China only grew by 1.4% (well short of the projected 2.0%) in 2017 , China still accounts for around 30% of global carbon emissions. Considering that bitcoin mining now makes up 0.6% of the world’s total energy consumption, and possibly more in the future, it’s a real concern that the cryptocurrency community must address.\nNonetheless, others say that the reason for the mining ban is simply related to the goal of enforcing a shutdown of all cryptocurrencies in general throughout China . The ability to create a new financial system could be seen as a threat to the current one. Even though this possibility isn’t unique to China, it’s important to consider China’s reaction to these changes now that it’s the world’s top economy by GDP . In reaction to the ban, some bitcoin miners h ave moved their mining operations overseas to places where both bitcoin trading and mining are legal. Photo Credit: Bloomberg USA (Upstate New York)\nEven though the United States federal government hasn’t placed a ban on bitcoin mining, some local governments have enacted legislation of their own bans.\nFor example, Plattsburgh, New York, a 20,000-resident town located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, has placed an 18-month moratorium on bitcoin mining. In the past few years, Plattsburgh had become a hub for bitcoin miners due to cheap electricity prices thanks to hydroelectric power production on the St. Lawrence River.\nHowever, the introduction of bitcoin mining has led to higher electricity costs for all residents. This was because the hydroelectric facility had to produce more than the typical allotted amount of energy to support mining operations. For example, in December 2017 and January 2018, even some residents who didn’t mine saw electric bills rise by $300.\nThose who might consider breaking this new law may want to think again – the penalty is set at $1,000/day of illegal mining. In Washington state Chelan County Public Utility District ( PUD ), there’s also a similar ban in place . One unauthorized bitcoin mining operation with electricity consumption of over 11,000 kWh has been shut down . Prior to authorities pulling the plug, this operation consumed about 20x the electricity of standard households. Photo Credit: GoTravelaz Malaysia\nAs written in a previous article , Malaysia has cracked down on illegal residential-based mining operations. In a coordinated raid, two of the country’s bitcoin mining farms were shut down. These operations were deemed illegal, not because of an overall ban on bitcoin mining, but because the individuals in charge of these operations didn’t have official business permits.\nEven though it’s not clear how easy or difficult it is to obtain government permission to run a mining operation in Malaysia, it is clear that complaints from neighbors were an important factor leading to the shutdowns. Neighbors reported that the operations caused power fluctuations and that the tenants were loud and disorderly. Even Legal Bitcoin Mining Could Lead to Illegal Activities\nMany nations or cities don’t have any laws banning mining or even requiring business permits as in the cases detailed above; however, there are many individual operations that have been shut down due to a few different reasons that constituted illegal mining activity.\nOne such incident occurred in Orenburg, Russia in April 2018. In this case, two individuals were arrested after it was discovered that they had created a bitcoin mining farm within an abandoned rubber factory . They were charged with property damage and a few other crimes. Also, these illegal miners stole 8 million kW/h of electricity valued at around 60 million rubles (~$1 million).\nIncidents like this are more common than you might think. For example, in the US, state government officials in both New York and Louisiana unlawfully used government resources to set up mining operations.\nWorkers at an Australian weather reporting agency also committed similar illegal activities. In all of these cases, it’s important to note that bitcoin mining itself was not illegal. However, the ways in which mining operations went about mining were illegal. If individuals had used their own time, money, and resources to mine, they would most likely face no legal issues.\nAlthough there are still quite a few areas where bitcoin mining is illegal, it seems as if the banning trend is slowing down. As long as miners proceed in a way that doesn’t negatively affect the lives of those around them, it wouldn’t be surprising to see these governments reverse the bans they’ve put in place.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:23:52.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9c79c7d6991d1a555a893b3908fe333162332bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkc10BsIRHyzSHa7juqnTECoXwouRE_begaRd0GtAYZIDJvJsq0zDrYoBseSwz6dg.E8w8VotuFik-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson Explains What Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin", "title_full": "Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson Explains What Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nKUALRmj9LTsQI9t0P1MqA--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/03bacd6823edcee3de2149cdb7818e23", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9c79c7d6991d1a555a893b3908fe333162332bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkc10BsIRHyzSHa7juqnTECoXwouRE_begaRd0GtAYZIDJvJsq0zDrYoBseSwz6dg.E8w8VotuFik-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Janine Wolf", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson Explains What Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin", "text": "Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson Explains What Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin Janine Wolf Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., speaks at the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2018.

The software advancement makes blocks big enough to process lots of transactions over time — which gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit. Unfortunately, many misdirected individuals assume the BCH chain will start processing 32MB blocks right away, which could lead to a blockchain chain that’s much larger in gigabyte size and takes longer to download. However, this is not the case right now at all, because BCH miners process blocks that are often still under 1MB, as the 32MB code is only set to ensure the network is capable in the future.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features\nThe Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption\nAfter the Bitcoin Cash network upgraded yesterday and even before the fork, a few misguided individuals asked why there was a need to raise the block size fourfold when 8MB blocks were not filling just yet. The reason developers raised the limit to 32MB is likely because the software is perfectly capable of handling such a task in the future. Right now block size limits are set by the miner, and developers are there to help set the capacity so blocks cannot get full in the immediate future, and fees will remain low for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network, Core developers let the block size fill beyond capacity, and fees became unreliable during the last quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block size adjustment ensures this will not happen to the BCH network down the road, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as 2017’s last quarter.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community and developers are not afraid of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th upgrade is the second successful hard fork on the BCH network.\nLooking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a website which records BCH chain data currently shows that mining limits are being set by the mining pool. Over the past nine months, there have been a few 2,4, and 8MB blocks processed, but typically blocks have been a megabyte or less. So in essence, once miners decide its necessary to increase the block sizes they process, they will do so based on transactions and adoption increasing over time. In fact, current data also shows the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is still 34.4GB larger than the Bitcoin Cash chain.\nAfter the block size increase miners are not processing 32MB blocks, the upgrade was meant to ensure they can handle that capacity in the future. Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by 186% in Nine Months\nAt the moment Bitcoin Cash transactions per day are less than BTC as there are roughly 20-25,000 daily BCH transactions. But there’s also been a misdirected notion that the BCH chain isn’t getting much use, but this is simply untrue as data shows over the past nine months that BCH daily transaction percentage rates have increased . The decentralized currency BCH has seen a steady incline (186%) of use since the August 1 fork and the expansion of BCH transactions are now only 5-10,000 transactions less per day than the Litecoin (LTC) network — a cryptocurrency that has been around for 7 years. This is due in part to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms like the tipping bot Tippr , the social media apps Memo and Blockpress , and other applications that help increase BCH usage.\nIn just nine months Bitcoin Cash has Facebook Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:39:48.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3c7f5cf83f0c26edd9cb02bb1e20a55c0b06b9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zUkUmY.5Cbm7iTfDTavwXL4gBsESLFCWpscptwzEE6mUNBBlzXW7Wskj9mdllJb_x0GbnigRhJMcusiy9FbZAOE-", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Impact of ICOs on the U.S. Technology Job Market | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "The Impact of ICOs on the U.S. Technology Job Market | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.138, "main_image": "https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Impact-of-ICOs-on-the-US-Technology-Job-Market.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3c7f5cf83f0c26edd9cb02bb1e20a55c0b06b9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zUkUmY.5Cbm7iTfDTavwXL4gBsESLFCWpscptwzEE6mUNBBlzXW7Wskj9mdllJb_x0GbnigRhJMcusiy9FbZAOE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Impact of ICOs on the U.S. Technology Job Market | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "The Impact of ICOs on the U.S. Technology Job Market Date: in: Bitcoin 0 Views\nIn this guest post, LiveEdu.tv‘s Simon Kariuki examins the effect of the emerging ICO market on employment trends in the US tech sector.\nIn 2017, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in the U.S. alone raised an incredible $4 billion through the sale of digital tokens. New cloud storage provider, Storj, raised $20 million in six hours, then went on to raise another $10 million over the next seven days. The $30 million was raised without the help of traditional lending institutions. With growth like this, it’s no wonder people are talking about the impact of ICO’s on the U.S. job market. Sponsored Links\nCompanies that can enter the market on a decentralized platform can compete with industry giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Also, these new companies are highly scalable and represent a unique strategy for today’s entrepreneurs.\nAs these ICO startup companies move forward, they’re creating thousands of jobs in the U.S. tech market. For instance, Education Ecosystem, a decentralized learning ecosystem for future technologies, has built a special category focused on cryptocurrency for their learning platform. In this category, detailed projects will be created that discuss blockchain and ICO technology. Through these project videos, viewers will be equipped with the necessary skills needed for the current technology market. During 2017, only about 7.3 million workers were employed in the IT industry, but today that number is 7.7 million and growing. Anything that can create 400,000 jobs that quickly is certainly worth keeping an eye on.\nAccording to the ICO Watch List, the United States represented 16.7 percent of all ICO projects in the world. Moreover, the total dollar amount raised in the U.S. totaled $811 million in the first quarter alone, and this figure is certain to grow even more by the end of the year. At this time, ICOs are raising venture capital at a much faster rate than all other funding sources combined.\nThe number of ICO companies is also growing. The total number of ICOs in the United States has reached 434, leading all other countries in the world by a landslide (Russia is second with 243). A significant portion of the funds raised by these various ICO projects is earmarked for the recruitment and hiring of new employees.\nIt’s clear that this explosion in ICO funding has played a major role in creating tech jobs. According to Boston analytics firm Burning Glass, research was conducted recently whereby millions of jobs posted were scanned searching for the words blockchain, distributed ledger , and bitcoin.\nThe results showed that New York ranks first with 1,316 job openings in ICO-related fields. San Francisco ranked second with 651 ICO job openings. Boston, Chicago, and Palo Alto are the remaining cities in the top five with job openings hovering around 200 each. In addition, large consulting firms like Deloitte, Accenture, and IBM now have job vacancies that are related to ICOs.\nWhile the growth of ICOs has had a significant impact on the U.S. tech job market, the increase in employment was not limited to just tech roles. There was a higher demand for a wide range of positions across many industries. A few of the factors that have attracted workers to ICOs have been higher salaries, better benefits, and flexible contracts.\nThe unique ICO funding phenomenon has inadvertently become a job market growth engine.

The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Anna Irrera, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna irrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "whbl square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:32:24.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1aadb2d3648be469b93153e164e6423ed0b24f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtT00eCkgBxlTjaSHf_ghBiVKLcV101MKAq6WtvvpIhsLv67QTg0OMig-", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin could fall drastically! - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin could fall drastically! - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1526512224_maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1aadb2d3648be469b93153e164e6423ed0b24f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtT00eCkgBxlTjaSHf_ghBiVKLcV101MKAq6WtvvpIhsLv67QTg0OMig-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin could fall drastically! - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "May 16, 2018 / By root About the author\nCopyright text 2017 byhow earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin . %d bloggers like this: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:10:49.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d261c45ac95194338df58f75ad20ca6b2db9ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJnXndqaPx6jyXspc0xU3VO0gq_En8zTF34qKpfvSwinEj.cV0w7ClBHHEBqsTAiVuE1Ph2TrU4zSJ9Ub4VCS2NXBtPFs0gtOZbBfTAr7b3Q--", "site_full": "www.terracrypto.pw", "site": "terracrypto.pw", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,300 — terracrypto", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,300 — terracrypto", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "PW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.terracrypto.pw/wp-content/themes/publisher/images/default-thumb/large.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d261c45ac95194338df58f75ad20ca6b2db9ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJnXndqaPx6jyXspc0xU3VO0gq_En8zTF34qKpfvSwinEj.cV0w7ClBHHEBqsTAiVuE1Ph2TrU4zSJ9Ub4VCS2NXBtPFs0gtOZbBfTAr7b3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,300 — terracrypto", "text": "India’s Largest Crypto Exchange Bitxoxo Announces TGE Май 16, 2018\n“Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers. To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising. We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem.”\nFacebook made a similar ban last January. Representatives explained that they could no longer promote unregulated financial options as they potentially put investors and their money through unsafe conditions. Company product management director Rob Leathern later commented, “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs, and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”\nGoogle took a similar route in March, explaining that all cryptocurrencies would be banned from its AdWords platform given that they were not regulated, and investors were offered no guarantees that digital currencies or ICOs operated in a clean or decipherable manner.\nAccording to one source , bitcoin is the victim of weak “technical setup.” It’s explained that bitcoin is back to the diamond formation it had escaped last week, and the price could potentially fall as low as $7,850 or $7,800 in the coming days. The source did say, however, that if bitcoin broke above $8,500, it could develop newfound resistance levels. Perhaps $9,000 isn’t far off the mark after all…\nAnd still, many analysts remain bullish towards the coin.

Granted we still have 12 years to wait, but both men believe bitcoin adoption will explode in the coming years, and that bitcoin transactions will account for roughly half of the world’s non-cash transactions, pushing the price to new heights.

From Jamie Dimon bashing it (then suddenly believing in it), what it comes down to is very simple: dollars and cents.\nIf you want to see whether someone believes in bitcoin (or at least wants to profit off it short-term) or not, determine if they have actually bought/traded any. If they're talking big, but doing nothing, you can take what they say with a grain of salt. In order for one's words to have any real import, a person needs to have some skin in the game, have a feel for the market, the sentiment, the community, the people.\nSo when I hear Bill Gates bash bitcoin but refuse to short it, his words then become utter nonsense to me–or rather, what he says will be contrary to what will likely happen. When I hear Warren Buffet bash bitcoin but refuse to learn about the technology, it's the same way.\nActions over words. When someone's actions are requisite to their words, then you can tell they're not trying to pull a fast one on you (usually; sometimes they still can find a way to do so). When someone's actions are contrary to their words, or they do nothing to match their words, their words are either meaningless, or less than meaningless.\nBut ultimately, what it comes down to, is you taking action yourself. You prove you have agency by jumping in, and not simply listening to the projections of others.

Canaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. While the price of bitcoin BTC=BTSP has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines. Both are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms. Canaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. Canaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China’s push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company. Ebang delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing. While many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software. Another miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern. In Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million. Canaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying. Credit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, IFR added. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But Dorsey had grown increasingly convinced that bitcoin would be the “native currency” of the internet, as he followed conversations around it on Twitter.\nHe spotted an opportunity to try meshing bitcoin into Square’s services during a company “hack week” last January. Dorsey, who shared the backstory of the Cash app’s bitcoin feature at Consensus, a digital currency conference going on this week in New York, said he got an engineer named Mike Brock to join him in the hackathon—although it took about a day for Dorsey to convince him to take part.\nTheir task, Dorsey said, was this: “Can we build a system where using my Cash Card, which was on Apple Pay at the time, can I have bitcoin [on the card] and go across the street to the Blue Bottle in the Twitter building and buy a cappuccino with my bitcoin?” Dorsey also is CEO at Twitter, another company he co-founded, and famously walks between the two firms’ offices (paywall) in San Francisco.\nThe Square hackathon started on a Monday; the duo had a week to reach their goal. But Dorsey and Brock failed. “We worked all week—he mainly did the work—but we ran into deployment issues, so we didn’t get the goal on Friday. But we did get it on [the following] Tuesday,” Dorsey said. “It felt amazing, it felt electric, and it felt like something we needed to explore a lot more.”\nAfter that cappuccino, Dorsey asked Brock to start building a bitcoin feature into the firm’s Cash app. Brock now leads a team, including several engineers in Sydney, who work on the app’s bitcoin brokerage features. Dorsey said he would visit the team next week.\nDorsey also revealed that he had a longstanding fascination with the cypherpunk movement—which believes in using cryptography to preserve freedoms like individual privacy—while growing up in St. Louis, Missouri, which would feed his later interest in bitcoin. “We had a huge hacker community there,” Dorsey said. “I grew up on this newsgroup called alt.cypherpunks and I was really fascinated by cryptography.” It would be on a cypherpunk mailing list that the mysterious bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto would publish his paper describing the mechanics of his digital currency.\nDorsey said he didn’t initially understand the significance of the bitcoin paper when it was published, but he appreciated the “philosophy” behind it, and how Nakamoto published it under a pseudonym. “What was really interesting was this sense of a currency, a currency based on cryptography. It was the ultimate application of cryptography,” he said.\nSquare’s embrace of crypotcurrency is still hotly debated in its boardroom. “On our board we have people who are pretty knee-deep in the financial industry,” he said, a reference to former Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar and former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers, “so we have healthy debates about cryptocurrency.”\nDorsey claims he’s still figuring out how Square could integrate cryptocurrency features more deeply, saying he was “resting in the I-don’t-know” for awhile. But he said the firm was committed to upholding the principles of decentralization that bitcoin is built on, noting that “no corporation or governing body can or should own” the technology behind cryptocurrencies.

Corgan: Blockchain ‘Bashing’ Bitcoin\nIn a long series of tweets summarizing the event, which ends May 16, Corgan highlighted what he described as “cargo-cult engineering” taking preference among speakers.\n“It’s like all the popular kids ( Blockchain ) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework,” he wrote Tuesday.\nEducator Jimmy Song had been first to publicly pan some aspects of Consensus, saying during a panel with a JPMorgan executive that Bitcoin was “the real innovation here.”\n“I don’t see anything other than buzzwords,” he said, adding on Twitter afterwards that his words “verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking.” 1/ My take on #Consensus2018 so far: It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework.\n— Johnathan Corgan (@jmcorgan) May 15, 2018 ‘Expensive And Slow Database’\nContinuing the theme, Corgan produced a lengthy explanation of why Bitcoin was the only “successful use” of Blockchain technology .\n“A blockchain is nothing more than an expensive and slow database,” he concluded.\nIt is a necessary but *insufficient* ingredient, and not even the most important one, of a system (Bitcoin) designed to provide monetary sovereignty to its voluntary participants.\nQuoting Song’s words about “sprinkling Blockchain dust all over a problem and it will be OK,” the core developer likened Consensus atmosphere to “cargo-cult engineering” – the practice of building infrastructure in the hope that material wealth would generate itself by definition.\nMeanwhile, markets have yet to witness some of the more buoyant predictions from Bitcoin bulls this week come true.\nPrior to the event, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee announced he expected it to trigger upward price movements which could top 70% compared to levels at the time around $9000.\nSo far, Bitcoin has underperformed, losing almost $1000 as a fresh Mt. Gox sell-off weighs on sentiment as Bitcoin price is currently holding at the $8200 support level.\nWhat do you think about Johnathan Corgan’s perspective on Consensus?

After falling to $8,500 yesterday from its previous mark of $8,800, bitcoin is once again stumbling down the staircase and is now trading for $8,300 – just a sliver above last week’s low of $8,250. The Coindesk Consensus Conference – which potentially gave bitcoin a boost over the last 72 hours – ends today, and it appears the hype it garnered for cryptocurrency is ending with it. No doubt, most investors are annoyed with bitcoin’s lack of strength against its newfound resistance. Many analysts now wonder if the currency will drop back down to the $7,000 range, which it last skimmed in March. One of the alleged reasons for the recent drop may be Bing’s recent ban of cryptocurrency ads. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the world’s second-largest search engine behind Google, and apparently doesn’t see safety in cryptocurrency usage. The platform made the announcement on its Bing Ads blog, and expects the ban to be fully integrated by either late June or early July. Advertising policy manager for Microsoft Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo explained: “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers. To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising.

In particular, it shows how some of the biggest winners from last year's 1375% surge in bitcoin, which was bested by other tokens including ether, may be the service firms that have formed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading and investment.\nThose firms include Coinbase Inc., the most popular consumer bitcoin wallet, and Bitmain Technologies Ltd., a Chinese builder of computer chips for digital currency transactions that is leading the $110 million investment round in Circle announced Tuesday.\nThe fundraising, one of the largest ever among crypto startups, also includes new investments by venture-capital firm Blockchain Capital and Tusk Ventures, as well as more money from existing investors IDG Capital, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst, Accel and Digital Currency Group. Goldman is not among the new round's investors.\nFive-year-old Circle's first product was designed for buying bitcoin and moving traditional money between individuals by using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.\nBut in the past year, its other business, facilitating big trades of digital currencies, has surged in volume and revenue.\nThat desk, called Circle Trade, says it has traded about $4 billion in the past month, handling trades from institutions, companies and wealthy individuals, Circle said. The company has said it generated $250 million in revenue from November to January.\nBy one measure, Circle is now the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency startup. Its $3 billion equity valuation surpasses that of Coinbase, which raised money at a $1.6 billion valuation late last year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\nCircle is one of a handful of so-called over-the-counter market makers who augment the smaller-value trades on exchanges, alongside such firms as Cumberland Mining. At least one big bank, Goldman, is exploring a role for itself in trading around cryptocurrencies.\nAs part of the funding, Bitmain will also join Circle's new project to launch new digital coins that can be exchanged for a fixed amount of traditional, or fiat, currency.\nJeremy Allaire, Circle's chief executive and co-founder, said the new coin and fundraising is part of the company's \"long-term vision for what's possible in building a new global economic system.\"\nCircle also recently acquired a digital asset exchange, Poloniex, and a retail investment application, now called Circle Invest.\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com\n 13:08 ET (17:08 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "telis demos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital currency startup soars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "circle internet financial ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:37:48.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc1df2b3bc41eb5b15b20ea37d01bafed0d24abe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.u7RGGaT0zHhjfL0ep2oBHc6Uo7tzTy1MGRcQcRMC7ZXPFMAKDpJlPxzrk.y4OwCv3jf_pXr03_l4eHwLEA9IXzzG5wPBnbam4ElkNdYzYOSWJYzdnuJZUhk4UwPNHGj8wGRHGjxKnKtpdkGw9i4h3lk4qBhQJWaI-", "site_full": "www.jetlifepennystocks.com", "site": "jetlifepennystocks.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, analyst says | Hot Penny Stocks, Awesome Penny Stocks, Best Penny Stock Alerts", "title_full": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, analyst says | Hot Penny Stocks, Awesome Penny Stocks, Best Penny Stock Alerts", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "http://www.jetlifepennystocks.com/wp-content/themes/jetlife/images/logo-site.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc1df2b3bc41eb5b15b20ea37d01bafed0d24abe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.u7RGGaT0zHhjfL0ep2oBHc6Uo7tzTy1MGRcQcRMC7ZXPFMAKDpJlPxzrk.y4OwCv3jf_pXr03_l4eHwLEA9IXzzG5wPBnbam4ElkNdYzYOSWJYzdnuJZUhk4UwPNHGj8wGRHGjxKnKtpdkGw9i4h3lk4qBhQJWaI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, analyst says | Hot Penny Stocks, Awesome Penny Stocks, Best Penny Stock Alerts", "text": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, analyst says Posted on by teamwork420\nSquare Cash is growing faster than PayPal's Venmo as more people turn to the software to trade cryptocurrency bitcoin, according to Nomura Instinet.

Whilst the high-ranking executive offered more thoughts than the outright dismissal of his CEO Jamie Dimon , they were not necessarily bullish for existing cryptos.\nPinto first confirmed that JPMorgan Chase were indeed ‘looking into’ the cryptocurrency space. He went on to state that the technology will be important in the future. However, when he addressed Bitcoin, he was less optimistic:\n“… you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities.”\nPinto continued and stated that he felt that Bitcoin will have a ‘very short life.’ For him, either people would cease to believe in the ideals of censorship resistance and decentralisation that the number one cryptocurrency represents or that it would be killed off by regulators. He then surmised his position:\n“I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form.”\nFinally, before moving onto other topics, Pinto addressed the interviewer’s mention of JPMorgan’s competitors starting to open up to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Rather than referring to the Goldman Sachs trading desk that appears to be launching imminently, he seemed to address the CME Group and Cboe futures contracts, however:\n“If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.”\nThe rest of the interview was taken up with Pinto addressing various other financial concerns. These included: the wider economy which he claimed was in ‘very good shape,’ investment opportunities in China, when the end of the current economic expansion would be, and JPMorgan Chase’s relationship with tech giants Amazon.\nDaniel Pinto was awarded the title of co-president of JPMorgan back in January of this year. He and his partner Gordon Smith are in line to take over the position of prominent Bitcoin naysayer Jamie Dimon should there be call to do so during the next few years.

The price is now looking bullish short term and might continue trading in the rising wedge for the next few weeks. It is possible that the price falls below the wedge close to $11,000 levels validating the stance of most analysts. While Consensus this year was attended by over 8000 members and Lamborghinis were spotted in the vicinity of the conference, it does not mean that everyone will just up and buy on one particular day to drive the price up to new highs. It is usual for mainstream investors to expect that but there are new players in the game who do not play by the same rules.\nBesides, the market cap of Bitcoin (BTC) has grown substantially big to be dominated by a few billionaires or a group of eager millionaires. Having said that, the interest of big players in Bitcoin (BTC) has also been on the rise. Those big players are institutional investors with billions of dollars at their disposal to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies . The difference is that they are not going to change their rules for Bitcoin (BTC). They are going to use the same tactics of manipulating the price so they can put in their iceberg orders in order to avoid spiking the price up in one go which will result in mass profit taking and the ‘clever’ institutional investors would be left holding the bags.\nIt might seem like a setback to think that Consensus 2018 has not had any impact on the price but it should be borne in mind that the rules of the game have significantly changed. As for impact, big players like NASDAQ trying to get involved in cryptocurrencies is proof enough of the impact that Bitcoin (BTC) has made in the recent past. A lot of big players are waiting on the sideline to get involved. While the situation might have appeared a bit murky the past few months, the big picture is very clear now.\nInvestors with billions to invest in a risky asset like Bitcoin (BTC) do not buy based on sudden whims or hype. They wait for the big pieces to fall in place before they get involved. Right now, that big piece is the comparison to 2013. Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be following the same pattern by accumulating before a big rally. Before the first signs of that rally materialize, big investors will not feel comfortable investing . However, the moment we see solid signs of a rally, big money is going to jump on the train like there is no tomorrow, the price will rise to new highs in a matter of weeks and for the common investor, it might be a bit too late to get involved. On the other hand, if these signs are invalidated, the sell off may not be a very quick one as the recent developments in the crypto markets has created a lot of ‘hidden euphoria’ which will manifest itself in the form of swift recoveries as we witnessed when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $6,000.

Cannon Las Vegas Review-Journal @KMCannonPhoto Cody Willard had what any conference speaker dreams of: A packed, attentive crowd anxious for the presentation to start.\nFor the 45-year-old former hedge fund manager, it was a bad omen.\nWillard gave a presentation on cryptocurrencies — the most profitable and volatile asset class of 2017 — during the Money Show at Bally’s, which runs through Wednesday.\nThere were not enough seats to hold the 200 attendees, mainly graying seniors, in the room. As Willard prepared to start, two retirees in the fourth row discussed their investments in bitcoin and NEO, another cryptocurrency.\n“I am very scared right now because this room is packed,” Willard told the audience within the first few minute of his speech.\nWhen Willard asked the audience if they were “chasing cryptocurrencies” to become “really, really rich,” an older woman called out, “Yeah.”\nWillard warned the crowd.\n“This is not the time to get rich. Wait for the crash. Everybody here is in a frenzy.”\n100-fold surge\nBitcoin surged as much as 20-fold in 2017 while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, jumped 100-fold. A $1,000 investment in Ethereum in January 2017 was worth about $100,000 by mid December.\nWillard told attendees that even the maitre d’hotel and waitstaff at Wynn Resorts Ltd. were talking about investing in cryptocurrencies when he visited the hotel during the CES conference in January.\nHe warned the audience that the crypto craze was reminiscent of the dotcom burst in the 2000s. The Nasdaq-100, an index of leading technology companies, lost 80 percent of its value between March 2000 and Oct. 2002 as many internet companies went bankrupt.\nWillard said he predicts that nearly all cryptocurrencies will go to zero. He warned them from buying shares of companies exposed to cryptocurrencies, such as exchange traded funds or investment companies, as a way to minimize the asset class’ risk.\n“Don’t buy any penny stocks related to blockchain. They are scams,” Willard said, highlighting Riot Blockchain as an example.\nBioptix, a NASDAQ-traded company making machinery for the biotech industry, changed its name to Riot Blockchain in October as it planned to switch its business focus to cryptocurrency investments.\nThat announcement caused the shares to surge about 10 fold from $4 to nearly $40 in under three months. The shares have since taken a nosedive back to $7.80.\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are digital assets based on blockchain technology. Startup companies seeking to employ blockchain technology to disrupt an industry, such as financial services, often issue coins in exchange for investment.\nThe process is known as an initial coin offering. The coins can trade on specialized exchanges, rising and falling in value like currencies.\nChaff from wheat\nThere are about 1,500 cryptocurrencies, said Rudi Von Abele, a senior analyst at Guild Investment Management, who took the floor at The Money Show before Willard.\nAbele also warned the crowd that cryptocurrencies were high risk and said most of the 1,500 coins in circulation wouldn’t survive.\nAbout a tenth of the audience raised their hands when Abele asked who had invested in cryptocurrencies.\n“There is a lot of chaff and very little wheat,’’ he said of the currencies. “This is highly reminiscent of the dotcom frenzy, but orders of magnitude worse.’’\nAbele said many of the companies selling coins aren’t offering an actual service. Rather their goal is to make a token, generate buzz “and unload it” onto investors.\nAbele’s colleague Tim Shirata said some people are using bots on social media to create excitement around a particular initial coin offering in order to pump up the price.\n“It’s absolutely amazing how [coins] can be manipulated,” Shirata said.\nBright future\nDespite the overvaluations and scams associated with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain-based companies that issue them, Abele and Willard said the technology is real and here to stay.\nSome blockchain companies could eventually become the next Facebooks, Amazons and Googles of the world, Willard said, but there will be an opportunity to buy them at much lower prices.\n“There is a need and a demand for them. There is going to be some incredible opportunities. But I am just telling you, this moment is not it,’’ Willard said.\nContact Todd Prince at 702-383-0386 or tprince@reviewjournal.com.

I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.”\nDorsey is of the opinion that the use of the number one digital currency or another altcoin as a global payment would lower the barrier for the payment company to enter new markets, reports CNBC .

In March, it was reported that the Square CEO said that he believed the digital currency would become the globally accepted ‘ single currency ‘ of the Internet within the next 10 years.\nIn November, Square began the introduction of Bitcoin buying and selling options on Square Cash, the mobile payment app developed by Square, for a small section of their users. Since then the payment company has rolled out additional features for its users, which now sees them able to buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin with the app. Dorsey has also committed personal funds to Lightning Labs as the team continues its work on the Bitcoin scaling proposal known as the Lightning Network.\nEarlier today it was reported that Square Cash is growing at a faster rate compared to PayPal’s Venmo, according to Nomura Instinet. Analyst Dan Dolev said that with the roughly 28 million downloads, the number of Square Cash downloads was just one million fewer than Venmo’s levels.\nIn a note to clients, Dolev stated that:\n“Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017.”\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Square reportedly sold $34.1 million in Bitcoin; however, it spent $33.9 million purchasing the cryptocurrency, meaning it’s adjusted revenue amounted to $200,000.

A partnership between Samourai Wallet and goTenna makes this possible. Samourai Wallet is an Android application that when used with goTenna’s antennas, will allow users to send transactions to their recipients. The Last Push for Decentralization\nMesh networks are a concept where users connect directly with each other. This aligns with the philosophy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency of using a P2P infrastructure.\ngoTenna’s offerings are also affordable, making mesh networks a practical alternative to traditional networks. Less than 25 nodes are needed for a well-connected network in a three-by-three-mile area; similar technologies would need hundreds of nodes to achieve similar results.\nMost transactions today require a connection from either an ISP or cellular tower, a centralized choke point in an otherwise decentralized system.\nThis raises concerns in case of a cybersecurity attack, or periods of downtime if a natural disaster were to destroy infrastructure. goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer Rich Myers told Bitcoin Magazine :\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.” How Does TxTenna Work?\nIn terms of what this means for bitcoin users, txTenna will enable transactions to be sent and received with virtually 100 percent uptime. Once a transaction is signed in the mobile wallet, the offline transaction is passed to the TxTenna app and broadcast to nearby mesh nodes with a paired goTenna mesh device. The transaction is relayed by goTenna devices in the area until an internet-connected node receives it and forwards to the Bitcoin network.\nAfter discussions with Samourai, the goTenna team’s suggestion was taken on board, as In the Mesh wrote on May 14:\n“We suggested using the free goTenna SDK to build an app for broadcasting offline bitcoin transactions via goTenna Mesh devices. Today we are pleased to announce that the Samourai team took our suggestion, and went well beyond our expectations! The result is the TxTenna app.”\nWith no reliance on a third party, there is no risk of downtime or security. Samourai has always been a privacy-conscious wallet with features like PayNyms and Ricochet, features that increase fungibility and security.\nThere is no specific release date, but progress on the project will be announced later in 2018. While it’s not the first to look into alternative ways to access the blockchain, it is the most viable.
