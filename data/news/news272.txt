The bloc agreed on Monday to force cryptocurrency exchanges to identify users. That will make it harder for criminals to use virtual cash to hide their ill-gotten gains.\nRepresentations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 13, 2018. Picture is taken February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration The EU’s bitcoin assault is part of a broader attack on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. To do so, the bloc is updating the existing anti-money laundering directive to shed light on opaque areas of the financial world. One key novelty is a requirement for the dozens of European exchanges which trade in currencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, and the technology companies that store the money in so-called wallets, to carry out the same know-your-customer checks as ordinary banks.\nThe new rules are an important step in the fight against illicit money flows. Anonymity, guaranteed via encrypted procedures, is probably one of the main reasons for the soaring popularity of digital currencies, which have seen their market values exceed $400 billion this year. Paying for goods and services in bitcoin or similar allows users to bypass regulated payment systems. That appeals to drug dealers or terrorists. BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink recently called virtual currencies an “index of money laundering”.\nThe European transparency push could help change things. If transactions are no longer secret, this should deter usage for illicit means, and facilitate the work of law-enforcement agencies. It may also make it harder for criminals to hack exchanges, as happened with Slovenian group NiceHash last year.\nCriminals can still use exchanges outside the EU. There’s also a danger that more trading simply moves off exchanges. But Europe is not alone in the fight. South Korea imposed similar rules earlier this year, and the United States may not be far behind. If more trading happens out of the shadows, virtual currencies could become more respectable.\nBreakingviews ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

The fortunes of companies issuing stock always have the potential to rise in a hurry, and, even if it’s not astronomical, it’s still at a higher rate than safer instruments like bonds. But stocks have received competition in that arena recently from the digital coins known as Bitcoin. In just a short period of time, the coins rose tremendously in value and made early investors extremely wealthy in the process. It is now starting to morph into a situation where many investors are choosing between the two assets to fill out their portfolio.\nThere are pros and cons to both assets, and there is an argument to be made that the best portfolios will have some of both stocks and Bitcoin included. For those who might be wary of how to get involved with Bitcoin, a trading program in the manner of Bitcoin Code can solve a lot of problems. Whenever you are deciding on an investment which will take some of your money, you should prepare by doing a comparison of how the asset in question stacks up against others of its ilk. Here is a side by side look at Bitcoin and stocks. Stocks\nStocks have an edge on Bitcoin in that they are generally less volatile, as Bitcoin, especially in recent months, has been prone to wild price swings that have even the heartiest investors feeling a little queasy. In addition, certain companies that issue stock also pay periodic dividends to investors, which can act as a kind of bonus. The downside to stocks is that the most dependable ones are quite pricey, and there are so many that it can be difficult to figure out which of the cheaper stocks actually have any potential. Bitcoin\nBitcoin is an exciting investment because even as is has already risen in value a tremendous amount, it has the capability of going much higher still. That’s because many of its adherents think it will eventually replace the financial system of banks and traditional financial entities. If that is the case, it can still be a financial windfall even for people who are just getting in it now. On the downside, there is a possibility that regulations might make it difficult for Bitcoin to continue to grow or even exist. The Argument for Having Both\nDiversification is one of the oldest tricks in the investment book, and it certainly holds true in this case. If Bitcoin soars, it will help you balance out any losses taken by stocks in the upheaval if you have it in your portfolio. If it craters or ceases to be, your exposure to stocks will help you mitigate the losses.\nNo matter whether you choose Bitcoin, stocks, or both, your best bet is to do as much research as possible before proceeding. If you can commit to that, your portfolio should be stable regardless of your selections.

The platform allows users to transfer loans anywhere in the world using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nAll payment transactions across the world on Bitbond are conducted via the bitcoin blockchain, and are independent of banks. Bitbond converts fiat currency to bitcoin and then converts it back to equivalent fiat currency of the borrower's country immediately after transfer.\nThe payment transfers are made globally at a lower cost and in a faster time frame compared to traditional money transfers, which are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees.\nThe platform enables borrowers to receive small business loans quickly at affordable interest rates, and lenders gain higher interest rates compared to the conventional banking system, because of the platform's peer-to-peer system. Either party does not get to know the identity of each other.\nA customer can borrow up to 50,000 euros within just a few days at fixed interest rates starting at 1 percent per month. Meanwhile, a lender can invest in small business loans and earn up to 25 percent in interest per annum.\nAn investor can either pick the loans to fund manually or use Bitbond's AutoInvest tool, which lets the investor create a diversified portfolio of loans according to their preferences in an automated way. They can also create a portfolio of loans that is diversified across many different countries.\nThis move by Bitbond could see the rapid adoption of blockchain technologies within the banking eco-space to save huge amount of money.

Zcash Price Spikes to $345\nZcash had entered the day trading just above $250, and it traded close to this mark until shortly after 8:00 UTC. At this point, the zcash price experienced a sudden spike to $345.\nThe coin was not able to sustain this level, and it has since ebbed to a present value of $306. Nevertheless, this represents a single-day increase of more than 22 percent, and it has raised the zcash market cap above $1.2 billion. ZEC Price Chart\nNotably, zcash is trading at a $16 to $18 premium against the South Korean won, though Korean exchanges currently account for a small percentage of ZEC’s global volume. In fact, zcash trading is fairly well-distributed for an altcoin, as no single exchange hosts more than 21 percent of the coin’s approximately $223 million in daily volume. Source: CoinMarketCap Winklevoss-led Gemini to List Zcash Markets Next Week\nThe zcash price rally occurred directly after New York City-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced that it had received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to add three ZEC markets, which will open for trading next Tuesday.\nZcash will be just the third cryptocurrency listed on the exchange, which was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Gemini has also received NYDFS approval to list bitcoin cash and litecoin, though it has not yet announced when these assets will be added to the platform.\nGemini users will initially be unable to withdraw their coins to shielded addresses, but the fact that the NYDFS — widely-considered to be one of the most stringent state-level cryptocurrency regulators in the US — would give the exchange explicit approval to list the privacy-centric cryptocurrency is significant, as these coins are often criticized for providing criminals with tools to facilitate money laundering. This development could bode well for other privacy-centric cryptocurrencies, including monero.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "zec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:12:52.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b390cc1edce13e3364463f17e01f10ad47cb6d5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa74q8VKb1hypp5lhhX9909fDjIz6MVJb2yoYc93u.RN2CU.61b4erFy3682jyyQecx0Sl3iHeWCuRGkJoLYR41KPKp5k9F8qA", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "A French Street Artist Made $1,000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals", "title_full": "A French Street Artist Made $1,000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-14T17:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b390cc1edce13e3364463f17e01f10ad47cb6d5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa74q8VKb1hypp5lhhX9909fDjIz6MVJb2yoYc93u.RN2CU.61b4erFy3682jyyQecx0Sl3iHeWCuRGkJoLYR41KPKp5k9F8qA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chronic_Media", "published": "2018-05-14T17:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "A French Street Artist Made $1,000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals", "text": "submitted by /u/Chronic_Media\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.artnet.com/art-world/french-street-artist-bitcoin-1283234"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:08:42.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c6c784a0ba39a1e60ab4e01b83df6889b02ac5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVhUNUUR.ZzG8nTyBCDgxotk0TvcTcsvowyCfVIouXnrKXxBptyrUxTkklsLtH1RU-", "site_full": "www.newkerala.com", "site": "newkerala.com", "site_section": "http://www.newkerala.com/world-news.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World News Update", "title": "Tangem Launches Bitcoin Banknotes in Singapore", "title_full": "Tangem Launches Bitcoin Banknotes in Singapore", "published": "2018-05-14T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 61094, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c6c784a0ba39a1e60ab4e01b83df6889b02ac5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVhUNUUR.ZzG8nTyBCDgxotk0TvcTcsvowyCfVIouXnrKXxBptyrUxTkklsLtH1RU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T17:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tangem Launches Bitcoin Banknotes in Singapore", "text": "Tangem Launches Bitcoin Banknotes in Singapore May 14, 2018 (24 hours ago) PRN SINGAPORE: Tangem, the new smart banknote platform, launches pilot sales of physical bitcoin notes at the Megafash Suntec City store in Singapore.

Information from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken will be used to determine the CME CF reference rate. This could be a hint of things to come for the second most popular crypto in the world, including possible US futures.\nAlso read: Zimbabwe Bans All Cryptocurrency Activity, Businesses Have 2 Month Grace Period CME Strikes Deal for Ether-Dollar Reference Rate\n“CME Group’s experience and knowledge in bringing the Bitcoin Reference Rate and Real-Time Index to market,” Chicago Merc’s website pithily stated, “has enabled us to launch an Ether-Dollar Reference Rate and Real-Time Index […] and the CME CF Ether-Dollar rates will provide a standardized reference rate and spot price index to bring confidence to any trading strategy. Major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken provide the pricing data to bring our dependable rate to the market.”\nIn the final quarter of last year, to much fanfare and hype, CME, along with crosstown rival Cboe, created a first of its kind: crypto futures. The experiment in running bitcoin core (BTC) in more mainstream financial contexts has been decidedly mixed. Some analysts even believe futures were a significant drag on digital asset prices due to allowing speculators to short BTC.\nCME’s Tim McCourt explained, “The Ether Reference Rate and Real Time Index are designed to meet the evolving needs of this marketplace. Providing price transparency and a credible price reference source is a key development for users of Ethereum.” Aiming for Institutional Investors\nCME is among the most trusted derivatives market makers in the world, as is a well-known player. Crypto Facilities Ltd is a crypto trading platform. The two have teamed to offer the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate (Ether Reference Rate) and Ether Real Time Index. Crypto Facilities will rely upon Kraken and Bitstamp order books as principal references. It hopes to add something like a daily benchmark in US fiat, real-time. Rollout is expected by CME Group and Crypto Facilities’ respective websites May 14, but formal CME market data platform distribution won’t begin until June 4th of this year.\nLondon-based Crypto Facilities’ Timo Schlaefer noted, “Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, experienced incredible adoption and growth in 2017, evolving into the leading blockchain for smart contracts. We are excited to be contributing to the strong community that has developed around the Ethereum network by providing a reliable reference rate and real-time Ether-Dollar price.”\nEarlier this week, Crypto Facilities detailed its other partnership with Chicago-based Akuna Capital and London-based market maker B2C2 in an effort to make ethereum futures contracts. The triumvirate hopes it can bring liquidity to ethereum futures. Aimed at institutional investors, such futures would allow long and short positions without dirtying hands (having to hold the actual coin). Akuna’s Toby Allen insisted his company is “looking forward to seeing this much-needed product fill a gap in the market. The addition of a futures product enables crypto traders to take both long and short positions in ETH and is another giant leap in the development of the crypto asset class.”\nIs having ether futures a good overall move for the crypto community?

The 100 SMA lines up with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level to add to its strength as resistance. \\n\nA larger pullback to the higher Fibs or the 200 SMA could still be possible, but RSI looks ready to head south without hitting overbought levels.

However, the price struggled to break the $1,500 resistance, which was also a support earlier. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is currently at $1,490 also acted as a major hurdle for buyers. The price is currently moving down and it broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high. \\n\nDuring the decline, there was a break below a short-term contracting triangle pattern with support at $1,450 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. It seems like the $1,500 barrier acted as a crucial resistance and prevented declines. It may decline further and trade towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high. Therefore, the next major support is around the $1,400 and $1,380 levels. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is currently under a minor bearish pressure below $1,480 and the 100 hourly SMA.

Companies are looking for ways to divest themselves of the traditional blockchain mining ecosystem. While once a perfect fit, mining is now running head first into scalability issues.\nBetween advancing hardware and intense power consumption, the average miner can no longer turn a profit. The recent proliferation of ASIC mining rigs is even damaging the core concept of blockchain technology – decentralization. If a single entity can produce enough mining power, they can control a majority of newly minted coins.\nAs such, proof of work (PoW) is becoming less attractive. In its stead, established projects and ICOs alike are looking to proof of stake (PoS) to offer a new solution. Rather than require arbitrary computations and shifting difficulties to meter the release of new currency, PoS relies on an investment in the project itself. Users that hold a portion of the currency can serve as validators – rather than a series of mining rigs. The Shift to Proof of Stake\nEthereum is easily the largest project to plan a switch to a PoS algorithm. Their dominance of the smart contract environment put them in a poor position at the beginning of 2018. Transaction speed slowed to a crawl and mining fees started to grow. A proof of stake algorithm would free resources to focus on transaction validation rather than coin creation. Further, it would remove ASIC mining rigs from the equation – and the associated centralization that goes along with it.\nMany of the newer proof of stake coins use MasterNode systems. In these environments, users must possess a certain minimum amount to be considered vested in the project. At this point, they have proven their stake in the success of the coin and are considered trusted parties to validate transactions. However, this also ensures that only those with MasterNodes can collect transaction fees – leaving smaller investors out.\nUpcoming exchange DECOIN avoids this all together. Instead, every user that holds a minimum amount of their DECOIN currency is entitled to a return on their investment – proportional to the stored value and without the need for establishing a MasterNode. As such, they are using proof of stake as a means of sharing the value produced by their exchange – and to validate transactions on their blockchain.\nDECOIN’s PoS setup helps to create a community within their exchange. Users benefit from holding the native currency, while DECOIN rewards their loyalty to the platform. We’ve seen examples of native exchange coins in the past, but few have been so specifically integrated to provide digital dividends. Non-Financial Benefits of Proof of Stake\nWhile the internal benefits of a PoS system are considerable, there is also an environmental impact to the alternative. PoW algorithms and the associated mining ecosystem consumes an incredible amount of electricity. This electricity is created through a variety of means, but almost all require some sort of finite resource. Untethering cryptocurrency from mining will go a long way towards easing public fears about the industry. Considering at least one northern New York city has banned mining altogether, the shift may need to happen sooner, rather than later.\nMore information on the ICO and the company itself, including whitepapers and vision, can be found on https://www.decoin.io", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://decoin.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&aff_id=1000&source=bitcoinist", "http://bitcoinist.com/world-class-crypto-expert-top-ranked-advisor-icobench-vladimir-nikitin-becomes-official-advisor-decoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:31:37.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f613f8e125b1cde040a79801c0908ca2ae2a5216", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxdzntUysZUeUuPDqJ3nvScsObGfwvGZo2RDaScAJxJb_3TpJ.vNOd.nGE0MkVveDioIAltY_6eO0Fzx_bBa_AR", "site_full": "famzn.com", "site": "famzn.com", "site_section": "http://famzn.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Famzn News", "title": "Banks should ‘segregate’ any bitcoin activities: ECB", "title_full": "Banks should ‘segregate’ any bitcoin activities: ECB", "published": "2018-05-14T17:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f613f8e125b1cde040a79801c0908ca2ae2a5216", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxdzntUysZUeUuPDqJ3nvScsObGfwvGZo2RDaScAJxJb_3TpJ.vNOd.nGE0MkVveDioIAltY_6eO0Fzx_bBa_AR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Admin", "published": "2018-05-14T17:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Banks should ‘segregate’ any bitcoin activities: ECB", "text": "Share this: PHOTO: pixabay.com\nBanks desirous to commerce in digital currencies should be certain these actions are clearly “segregated” from their different operations, a high ECB official cautioned Monday, as ever extra monetary establishments mull leaping on the bitcoin bandwagon.\n“Due to the excessive volatility of VCs (digital currencies) it might sound applicable to require any VC buying and selling to be backed by sufficient ranges of capital, and segregated from different buying and selling and funding actions,” European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch mentioned in a speech in Turkey.\nThe warning comes as regulators worldwide grapple with how to answer the growth in so-called cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which lure buyers with the promise of excessive returns however should not backed by any central banks and may fall prey to scams.\nVirtual currencies “should not cash” and their affect on the true economic system stays restricted, Mersch insisted.\n“But this could change,” he admitted.\nUS banking big Goldman Sachs introduced plans in March to start out buying and selling bitcoin futures, in what could possibly be a step in direction of giving the notoriously opaque cryptocurrency market extra legitimacy.\nSeveral smaller monetary gamers have already taken the plunge.\nIn Switzerland, Falcon Private Bank presents asset administration providers for a vary of cryptocurrencies, together with bitcoin and ethereum, whereas monetary and buying and selling providers group Swissquote presents buying and selling in 5 digital currencies.\nUnderscoring the excessive threat that comes with betting on digital currencies, Mersch famous that the worth of bitcoin had plunged from virtually $20,000 (16,700 euros) to beneath $7,000 between December and February.\nBitcoin buying and selling remains to be in its infancy, Mersch mentioned, with some 200,000 bitcoin transactions carried out globally every day in contrast with 330 million retail funds within the euro space.\nBut if the usage of cryptocurrencies spreads, “a crash might have an effect on the soundness of the broader monetary system if massive banks have been to carry large unhedged exposures to VCs”, he warned.

(EPAZ)\nCategory: News\nApril 26, 2018\nEpazz, Inc. (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, this morning announced plans to release the next version of its ZenaPay Blockchain Bitcoin wallet in June. Per the update, this new release will add support for Bitcoin Cash and Segwit to the platform’s existing cryptocurrency options of Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin Cash support will give users an additional option when making cryptocurrency transactions, the company notes that Segwit support will help reduce the size of Bitcoin transactions. In total, Segwit support is expected to reduce median fees by one-third, providing the means for Epazz to greatly expand its user base. “We continue to expand and improve ZenaPay, which is being a more competitive solution with each new version,” Shaun Passley, CEO of EPAZ, stated in the news release.\nTo view the full press release, visit http://nnw.fm/215Uy\nAbout Epazz, Inc.\nEpazz, Inc. specializes in enterprise cryptocurrency blockchain mobile apps and cloud business process software, with more than 500 repeat customers.

Epazz technology makes it easy to convert legacy systems into cloud business process software, for which the company then charges an annual subscription fee. Epazz has acquired 11 software companies that have converted or are in the process of converting their legacy software products to cloud software using Epazz technology. Epazz then markets the new cloud-based solutions to new and existing customers. For more information, visit the company’s website at www.Epazz.com\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

This time the communique was signed by Dr John Mangudya, the central bank governor himself. The Governor Says Zimbabwe Must Not Lead\nThe most interesting bit for me was at the end of the very long and verbose warning:\nThe Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor regional and global cryptocurrency developments in order to inform policy direction. advertisement\nThis was really disappointing for me. Instead of proactive action, learning and study the RBZ has decided to MONITOR developments elsewhere. Why should our story be just about following others? It really disappoints me because Zimbabwe was really leading in this new technology and development. Even Experts Think Banning Cryptos Is Not Wise\nI am grateful to a Techzim reader who posted the following quote in the comments to an earlier article I wrote . The quote is from a written testimony of J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairmanof the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission before the United States Senate banking committee:\nWe are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination. Anyway, What Else Did VaMangudya Say?\nHere’s the full statement from the man:\nPRESS STATEMENT WARNING AGAINST TRADING IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n1. Further to the Press Statement issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (the Reserve Bank) on 20 December 2017 on the use of virtual currencies in Zimbabwe, the Reserve Bank wishes to reiterate that virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin do not have legal tender status as they are neither issued by the Reserve Bank nor guaranteed by the government.\n2. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has not authorised or licensed any person or entity or exchange for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange or investment in any virtual currencies/coins/tokens in Zimbabwe. Exchanges such as Bitfinance (Private) Limited (Golix) and Styx24 are not licensed or regulated by the Reserve Bank.\n3. For the avoidance of doubt, dealers and investors in any kind of cryptocurrency in Zimbabwe are not protected by law. Virtual currencies are traded in exchange platforms that are unregulated, all over the world.\n4. The opacity and pseudonymous nature of virtual currencies presents regulatory concerns due to the potential risks to the public and financial stability. The nature of cryptocurrency transactions make them the currency of choice for money launderers and other criminals, seriously undermining global efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Anonymity renders the transactions difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace.\n5. Financial regulators around the world have identified the dangers and risks presented by virtual currencies which include risk of loss due to price volatility, theft or fraud, money laundering and other criminal activities.\n6. Cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate tax evasion as well as externalization of funds in violation of a country’s laws. Any instrument or platform that results in a flow of foreign exchange or value into and out of Zimbabwe (or between residents and non-residents), is therefore subject to approval in terms of the Exchange Control Act. The anonymity of transactions in respect of virtual currencies have the potential to result in exchange control circumvention as the transfer would not be effected and reported by an Authorised Dealer in foreign exchange.\n7. Central banks are stewards of public trust and have an obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems as it has implications on financial stability. Cryptocurrencies have strong linkages and Interconnectedness with standard means of payments and trading applications can rely on much of the same infrastructure that serves the overall financial system.\n8. In order to safeguard the integrity safety and soundness of the country’s financial system, and to protect the public in general, all financial Institutions have been required to ensure that they maintain sound and adequate anti-money laundering controls to enable them to comply with customer identification, verification and transaction monitoring requirements. Further, the Reserve Bank has directed banking Institutions not to provide banking services to facilitate any person or entity dealing with or settling virtual currencies.\n9. Members of the public are hereby further, warned not to participate in the trade of cryptocurrencies\n10. Any person who buys, sells, or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country. ,\n11. The Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor regional and global cryptocurrency developments in order to inform policy direction.\nDr J P. Mangudya\nGovernor The Contradiction\nThe governor initially describes cryptos as pseudonymous (which they are) which means that if exchanges adopt standard KYC regimes (Golix and other exchanges have) crypto activity can be traced to individuals. Later the governor says the ‘anonymity’ of cryptos gives problems. Wait, which is it? Are they pseudonymous or anonymous? The governor cannot be at liberty to choose whatever words he wants to support a position.\nCryptos are pseudonymous and the beauty of the blockchain is that there is a permanent trace of all activity hence with a more creative and progressive attitude tracing money laundering and such evils could be easier on the blockchain than with cash definitely. Is It Now Illegal To Hold Or Trade Bitcoin In Zimbabwe?\nFor all the words used by the governor, this remains unclear. In some part it appears as if he’s saying you can deal with cryptos at your own risk as long as you don’t use the banking system:\nAny person who buys, sells, or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country\nAnd it feels like it’s the banks themselves that have the burden of making sure they don’t receive crypto money. However, if I sell bitcoin to my brother, how will the banks ever know?\nIn another breath it sounds as if trading in cryptos is banned outrightly:\nThe anonymity of transactions in respect of virtual currencies have the potential to result in exchange control circumvention as the transfer would not be effected and reported by an Authorised Dealer in foreign exchange.\nI will leave you to make your own conclusions…\nJohn Mangudya RBZ Golix\nJohn Panonetsa Mangudya is an economist and the current Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor.

This suggests that the downtrend is more likely to continue than to reverse. \\n\nThe gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect a pickup in selling momentum. The 100 SMA lines up with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level to add to its strength as resistance. \\n\nA larger pullback to the higher Fibs or the 200 SMA could still be possible, but RSI looks ready to head south without hitting overbought levels.

It has also been reported that the launch of bitcoin futures led to the slump last December, which kept investors on edge that further bitcoin products could draw more selling action. \\n\nNonetheless, more institutional money is projected to flow into the industry and this could mark the start of less dependence on speculative activity and higher volumes. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Will the Bearish Moves Continue?

However, the price struggled to break the $1,500 resistance, which was also a support earlier. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is currently at $1,490 also acted as a major hurdle for buyers. The price is currently moving down and it broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high. \\n\nDuring the decline, there was a break below a short-term contracting triangle pattern with support at $1,450 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. It seems like the $1,500 barrier acted as a crucial resistance and prevented declines. It may decline further and trade towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high. Therefore, the next major support is around the $1,400 and $1,380 levels. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is currently under a minor bearish pressure below $1,480 and the 100 hourly SMA. If buyers succeed in gaining momentum above $1,500 and 100 hourly SMA, there could be more gains.

Seminole County Tax Collector Joel Greenberg said in a statement Monday that his office will take a bitcoin and bitcoin money for obligations associated with driver licenses and Identity document, automobile tags and names and property tax. The office decided to take the cryptocurrencies in an effort to streamline charge collection, decrease the possibility of fraud and id theft and increase the transparency and accuracy of payments. Greenberg’s office added that it doesn’t comprehend any cost volatility or risk to the county by accepting the cryptocurrencies.\nGreenberg stated in the announcement: . The purpose of my office term is to do our client experience faster, smarter and much more efficient, and also to bring government agencies from the eighteenth century into the twenty-first century and also one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our repayment options. The alliance with the tax collector of the county Seminole notes that BitPay is the first administration partnership. Head of compliance Jeremie Beaudry stated the business was launched because we realized the possibility of blockchain to revolutionize the financial sector, making payments faster, more secure and more affordable on a global scale.\nWith the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we’ve engaged our very first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash making it easy and smooth for them. He added. But, Greenberg’s workplace isn’t the only local government entity which has entertained the idea of accepting cryptocurrency for taxation. Arizona and Georgia lawmakers both proposed bills this year that would allow taxpayers to pay their country tax liabilities in bitcoin along with other cryptocurrencies, although neither bill made it through their respective legislatures.

CLASSIFIED", "text": "via Global Intel Hub :\n5/12/2018 — Bitcoin is now the talk of the town (Wall St.) and yet we don’t know who created it. There’s lots of theories, but we haven’t seen any documented evidence. Having experience in this business looking at the FX markets melt down over the last 10 years in a fraud climax, we wrote Splitting Pennies and explained the world isn’t as it seems . That was before Bitcoin. Because like for any investment you want to do your due diligence, we started peeling back this onion and wanted to start from inception – and find out who created this (as just like with any investment analysis, it’s another data point). What we found was astonishing – nothing! No documents, no photographs, no reports, from Satoshi. Whoever it was created a real pseudonym in order to mask their real identity. But why? Now the value of Satoshi’s original coins would be in the tens of billions – why not claim them? It is our logic that it can only be someone or some group connected to the US Government, an employee perhaps – not necessarily that Bitcoin is the brainchild of the government, although that is possible as NSA has the best mathematicians in the world. We compiled this research into our leading hypothesis in an article here: EXPOSED: The real creator of Bitcoin is likely the NSA as One World Currency\nOur point is not that we know 100% that this is the case, simply that it’s the most plausible story, and we haven’t uncovered any evidence to the contrary. Lots of people have different opinions, but they haven’t produced any document proving otherwise. So we wrote the NSA and asked them, did you create Bitcoin? Hey, we are taxpayers. They work for us. Don’t forget that! Their response was not surprising, they said “That’s Classified” –\nWhile this is no surprise what we have started is a paper trail, hopefully that will lead to the revealing of the creator or creators of Bitcoin. For those who are not from the financial services community, it is important to note why anyone would go through such trouble – it’s called due diligence. When investors make investments they want to know every single detail about that investment. Some of these DD questionnaires can be 100 pages they can have 300 questions! It can take months, require multiple flesh meetings, they may bring in external advisers – it may seem like a circus but if someone is investing $100 Million then it’s really the least one can do. Anyway, do Bitcoin investors really understand what they are getting themselves into?\nThis article deserves a full read: Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto was probably an NSA Employee — and the NSA may destroy Bitcoin Bitcoin has a huge risk few consider: it can be destroyed overnight\nMy second NSA related theory and prediction, is that the NSA will be tasked to take down Bitcoin. While relative to the Internet, blockchain is very secure and effectively unhackable for a criminal group — it is in fact quite capable of being cheated and manipulated if you have enough computing power. NSA probably has plenty of computing power and expertise to take the Bitcoin blockchain down. Why would the NSA want to take down Bitcoin? What NSA wants is irrelevant — it’s what government leaders want. And there are many scenarios that could lead to an order to take the Bitcoin blockchain down, with either minor disruption (letting it come back with just a few accounts robbed) or totally destroyed (stealing from many accounts and screwing it up so badly it is impossible to restore):\n1. North Korea is a major owner, user, exploiter (for computer ransomware) of Bitcoin. As a sanction, punishment, or means of waging war, NSA could be ordered to rob accounts suspected of being NK owned.[1]\n2. Bitcoin and many of its owners and advocates are Libertarian and anti-government. Bitcoin is an affront to national “fiat” currencies and handy for evading government rules and taxes. Big Government is very motivated to destroy Bitcoin.\n3. Bitcoin has been used as ransom payments for computer hacking. I predict it will soon be used for human ransom as well. Rather than the high risk of transferring dollars, kidnappers may demand digital payment in Bitcoin. This could be a motivation, or excuse, for Big Government to take Bitcoin down.\nChina or Russia also have the computing power to take down Bitcoin, and may want to do so. Why? China has outlawed Bitcoin, may want to take North Korea’s wealth down a peg (keeping them more dependent on China), and could make a huge profit doing this.\nThe point is that it is 1) POSSIBLE and 2) NOT PROBABLE this is a low-probability high-impact event but one that any Bitcoin investor needs to understand – it is possible. Just as it was very weird and surprising how Bitcoin suddenly rose to 20,000 it certainly is possible, that it can really go to zero. Not because of selling but because the network can be brought down. Whether NSA created Bitcoin or not is really irrelevant, they are the only agency in the world with the computing power and intellectual human capital (Cryptographers) capable of 1) understanding Bitcoin and 2) through their surveillance network identifying the real Satoshi if it was in fact NOT NSA and 3) Capable of actually monitoring Bitcoin users and identifying a real human based on Stylometry, a technique for analyzing big data.\nTo understand how the NSA really operates, they record both data and raw data such as encrypted and un-encrypted internet traffic IN BULK for later analysis. The computing power of the NSA is ridiculous, China and Russia don’t come close, nor do any corporations.\nGoing back to their answer; what did we expect them to say? Yes, we did it? Well if they did it certainly would be easy to say it, they have thousands of active projects who cares about MONKEYROCKET. NSA was created and NSA can be destroyed, if it no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally intended. And practically if NSA was doing useful projects like Bitcoin it may be a benefit to their argument proving the need for their existence. As most of us know, there are no real enemies anymore to fight, so having such a big and complex military intelligence apparatus is harder and harder to justify as the new generation of global idiots gets more and more peaceful and dumbed down.\nSo, we’ll appeal it, but will likely get another canned response. In the meantime, we ask anyone who has any documents pertaining to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto to come forward.\nBloc10 is releasing this week Blockpad software; Blockpad is a private encrypted personal ledger, notepad, password manager, secure browser to access exchanges, one time pad, and more.

By May 14, 2018 0 shares\nThe value of the virtual currency bitcoin soared in 2017, reaching almost $20,000 – or £14,391 – in December, reported the Express . That was up from a value of only about $1,000 in March 2017, to cite a figure from CCN . Nonetheless, Bitcoin has recently faltered as state bodies have taken issue with the currency. Is this a sign that the bitcoin boom has now come and gone? Bitcoin’s value has risen more than a bit…\nIn January, reports that South Korean regulators were seeking to ban crypto trades led various top cryptocurrencies – as virtual currencies are otherwise known – to crash. The crypto market lost up to $300 billion – or £216 billion – in total market capitalization, as Ripple and Ethereum plummeted.\nThese tokens fell yet further in value in the wake of fears that the Indian government would also issue crackdowns. The incredible volatility of bitcoin has led financial experts to advise against buying and trading with this currency, which they have deemed a bubble on the verge of bursting.\nFinancial watchdogs of the European Union are also keeping a close eye on the currency. European Commission vice president Valois Dombrovskis has drawn attention to bitcoin’s “clear risks for investors and consumers associated with price volatility”. Will bitcoin stumble or keep rising?\nThere is a reason to believe that bitcoin’s value could be about to hit a ceiling. Referring to the value’s drop in January, financial expert David Garrity has commented: “From a trading point, the sentiment is driving the market because, as of yet, we don’t necessarily have mass adoption on the part of bitcoin for payment purposes.”\nNonetheless, Bitcoin appears to have weathered the storm relatively well by historical comparison. Chinese Angel Investor Cai Wensheng, who gathered 10,000 bitcoins after the January crash, has said that even a further fall for the currency’s value in March was not a major concern.\nIn an interview, he pointed out that, while bitcoin’s value touched a nadir of $6,000 that month, this remained six times the value in March a year earlier. Bitcoin trader Arthur Hayes has even forecast that the value will skyrocket to $50,000 this year.\nIn an explanation quoted by the Express , he insisted that “people will want to get involved”, adding that the $50,000 level is achievable because “more people are going to put small amounts of money into this base. This is a retail-led phenomenon.” How should you react to the bitcoin situation?\nAs a businessperson, you might understandably be unsure about how to react to bitcoin. Are you contemplating accepting it as a currency payable by your customers or clients? Alternatively, you might be considering investing in it, though you should probably tread with caution.\nHowever you treat bitcoin, you should remember its instability, which could increase the urgency that you help stabilise your company by properly insuring it. An insurance broker can help you to learn more about how to source insurance you want – or perhaps even legally need – at the right price. 0 shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bewiserbusinessinsurance.co.uk/", "https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/903826/Bitcoin-price-value-USD-cryptocurrency-market-Ripple-XRP-binance-coin-investment-video", "https://www.ccn.com/chinese-angel-investor-gathers-10000-bitcoins-during-bear-q1-2018/", "https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/908024/Bitcoin-price-value-worth-cryptocurrency-finance-Ripple-ethereum-futures-USD-Bit-XRP-video"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T17:38:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efc9039eae39da62ba7ca24f77ac0b058da68bd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ4648SdcVvvp2FqnD9N94MaIg--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=20", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Lan - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-14T17:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efc9039eae39da62ba7ca24f77ac0b058da68bd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ4648SdcVvvp2FqnD9N94MaIg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-14T17:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "text": " software for SEO/SMM\nXEvil + XRumer: NEW solving CAPTCHA program! , Google ReCaptcha2 BROKEN! , XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans , XEvil 4.0 + any SEO/SMM software = PROFIT!\n1.

Durch diese Kollaboration gibt es nun die Möglichkeit, ein Überweisungsnetzwerk aus den USA und Kanada in Länder wie Argentinien und Uruguay mit der Blockchain-basierten Geldtransfer-App „Airpocket“ zu nutzen. Dies spricht sowohl die großen lateinamerikanischen Arbeitergruppen an, die Geld nach Hause schicken wollen, als auch rund 65 Prozent der Lateinamerikaner, die sagen, dass sie mehr Transaktionen über ihr Handy tätigen wollen, so eine E-Marketer-Umfrage. Dies war der höchste Prozentsatz aller untersuchten Regionen. Da Digitalx noch relativ jung ist, liegt der Market-Cap gerade einmal bei 50 Millionen US-Dollar. Digitalx steht zwar gemäß Market-Cap ganz am Anfang, besitzt jedoch dank der Kooperation zu Telefonica und dem innovativen Ansatz des „Airpocket“ großes Potential – gerade in einem Markt wie Lateinamerika. TIO Networks hat, ähnlich wie Sia Tech, das Potential den Cloud-Markt aufzumischen – gerade bei den Themen Pricing und Security können beide Clouds klare Vorteile gegenüber Amazon S3, Google Cloud und Microsoft Azure bieten.🚀 0 Beitrag zu dieser Diskussion schreiben\nUm einen Beitrag schreiben zu können, müssen Sie sich anmelden!

Will bitcoin price surge once again during the event as it has in previous three years? RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BITCOIN PRICE AND CONSENSUS\nA look at the previous three Consensus Conferences shows significant crypto price movements during and immediately after. This trend has been maintained in all three conferences so far.\nThus, it stands to reason that the pattern could continue in 2018. Blockchain conferences create a lot of hype and buzz. Traders are less likely to sell during the duration of these important crypto gatherings as important announcements are expected.\nIn 2015, bitcoin prices increased by 23 percent during the conference and continued on a 121 percent rally in the two months that followed. About 500 people attended the 2015 gathering, which took place on September 10.\nThe following year, the attendance tripled to 1,500. Bitcoin prices increased by 10 percent during the Consensus week and 78 percent in the following two months. Then in 2017, attendance doubled. At the same time, Bitcoin price spiked by 69 percent at the time and 138 percent in the following two months.\nThe 2018 event is expected to have triple the attendance of last year with over 7,000 people expected at the conference. If the historical trend holds, bitcoin prices could grow by at least 50 percent during the conference and a further 100 percent rally till the start of summer.\nThis means bitcoin price could break the $10,000 mark this week and approach $16,000 by July. Though these figures are still shy of Tom Lee’s $20,000 mid-year bitcoin price prediction .\nAltcoin prices have also had spectacular rallies during and after previous Consensus Conferences as they tend to follow Bitcoin. In 2017, the average altcoin price increase during the meeting was 176 percent while mean prices spiked by 552 percent in the two months that followed. POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS\nHistorical figures are a vital analysis tool in the crypto market. However, the nascent nature of the industry makes it difficult to rely solely on these figures to establish a pattern.\nIt will be interesting to if the pattern holds as the situation in 2018 is a lot different from previous years with this year’s record attendance and unprecedented global attention.\nThis year has also seen an increase in regulatory oversight measures from government and financial regulators. Meanwhile, negative rhetoric from naysayers like Warren Buffett , Bill Gates , Charlie Munger, etc., has particularly been in the news as of late, while South Korea appears to be widening its probe on crypto exchanges in the country.\nCrypto enthusiasts and traders, however, will have their fingers crossed hoping for history to repeat itself. The market waits with bated breath to see what becomes of it as Consensus begins.\nWill history repeat itself causing a bitcoin price rally during and after the Consensus Summit? Let us know in the comment section below.\nImage courtesy of Twitter @Super_Crypto, Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-a-watched-pot-never-boils/", "http://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-consensus-conference-will-trigger-bitcoin-price-increase/", "http://bitcoinist.com/warren-buffett-calls-bitcoin-rat-poison-ignores-real-world-utility/", "http://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-strategist-bitcoin-is-still-bullish-will-hit-25k-by-year-end/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/", "http://bitcoinist.com/south-korean-authorities-raid-three-cryptocurrency-exchanges/", "http://bitcoinist.com/bill-gates-i-agree-i-would-short-it-if-there-was-an-easy-way-to-do-it/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "consensus conferences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:57:14.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45d572c59a4b3d1e74a7d0f947eb23082dd4d632", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRJju.flQuBvpkRttZ2GHeE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Reasons why Bitcoin is droping:", "title_full": "Reasons why Bitcoin is droping:", "published": "2018-05-14T16:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45d572c59a4b3d1e74a7d0f947eb23082dd4d632", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRJju.flQuBvpkRttZ2GHeE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mersterious", "published": "2018-05-14T16:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reasons why Bitcoin is droping:", "text": "because all of the people think that bitcoin is scam otherwise people drop it and Talks of crytocurrency ban by governments is contributing to the fall in prices", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T12:07:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20eafd760e25c5ac80f20196ca7863f5c04d37f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8Q59MzXaTdycm1oQ_BLMI5nnqygPrPxFFyAkjTzVuoPUXZNsLi2gF1_jtYtBfuwgVAOix79.8DkOxqX31DwocQI-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Learn more about Thailand's stance towards Cryptocurrency & how the government is planning on regulating Bitcoin", "title_full": "Learn more about Thailand's stance towards Cryptocurrency & how the government is planning on regulating Bitcoin : btc", "published": "2018-05-14T16:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.499, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20eafd760e25c5ac80f20196ca7863f5c04d37f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8Q59MzXaTdycm1oQ_BLMI5nnqygPrPxFFyAkjTzVuoPUXZNsLi2gF1_jtYtBfuwgVAOix79.8DkOxqX31DwocQI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cryptohype", "published": "2018-05-14T16:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Learn more about Thailand's stance towards Cryptocurrency & how the government is planning on regulating Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/cryptohype\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptohype.tech/bitcoin-exchanges-thailand/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:11:04.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03362d429e43bc0c58b3643bf14bd2a0d3684be5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftHSfDk6LtlO145lHOkQAD1jRBsbGiveW0vPqRQO_UtR3vFimQNt.7iilUsm_NAD31g--", "site_full": "www.rt.com", "site": "rt.com", "site_section": "http://rt.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RT -

Thessaloniki, Greece, October 4, 2017 © Alexandros Avramidis / Reuters Alleged bitcoin \"crime mastermind\" Aleksandr Vinnik, wanted in the US, has confirmed that he survived a murder attempt while in prison, adding that since then Greek authorities have beefed up security to protect him.\nWashington accuses Vinnik of laundering $4 billion with the help of the BTC-e bitcoin trading platform. The Russian denies any wrongdoing. Speaking to RIA Novosti via his lawyer, Vinnik confirmed that there is a threat on his life in Greece where he is currently in jail. The prison, however, beefed up security measures to protect him.\nREAD MORE: Greek ruling to extradite Russian Bitcoin expert to US violates int’l law – Moscow\n“These special measures have been taken since early February, the head of the prison told me in the presence of the Thessaloniki city prosecutor. He explained that someone wants to poison me, there is a kill order for me. This information was official,” Vinnik said in comments sent to RIA. The Russian stressed that he also received threats via phone.

He is escorted by a security guard in prison to exclude any contacts with other prisoners.\nVinnik was arrested in the resort area of Halkidiki, near the city of Thessaloniki in northern Greece in July 2017. It was claimed that he had links to BTC-e digital currency trading and exchange platform, which he allegedly used for money laundering. The US also claims that Vinnik is behind the hack of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.\nIn the meantime, Russian authorities have also requested Vinnik’s extradition, accusing him of stealing 600,000 rubles ($10,500) from an unidentified entity “using... deception and the internet.” Vinnik says that he is ready to be extradited to Russia, confirming that he wrote to the Russian Interior Ministry and General Prosecutor’s office.\nIn February this year the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a warning to all citizens about the threat of being detained or arrested in foreign countries at the request of US special services. Vinnik’s arrest was one of the examples given by the ministry.\nIt also warned that after being handed over to the US justice system, Russian citizens often encounter extremely biased attitudes. “Through various means, including direct threats, they attempt to coerce Russians into pleading guilty, despite the fact that the charges of them are far-fetched. Those who refuse get sentenced to long prison terms,” the statement stressed.\nThink your friends would be interested?

conference, Bitcoin's biggest event of the year, begins today, May 14, 2018. Will bitcoin price surge once again during the event as it has in previous three years?\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BITCOIN PRICE AND CONSENSUS A look at the previous three Consensus Conferences shows significant crypto price movements during and immediately after. This trend has been maintained in all three conferences so far.\nThus, it stands to reason that the pattern could continue in 2018. Blockchain conferences create a lot of hype and buzz. Traders are less likely to sell during the duration of these important crypto gatherings as important announcements are expected.\nIn 2015, bitcoin prices increased by 23 percent during the conference and continued on a 121 percent rally in the two months that followed. About 500 people attended the 2015 gathering, which took place on September 10.\nThe following year, the attendance tripled to 1,500. Bitcoin prices increased by 10 percent during the Consensus week and 78 percent in the following two months. Then in 2017, attendance doubled. At the same time, Bitcoin price spiked by 69 percent at the time and 138 percent in the following two months.\nThe 2018 event is expected to have triple the attendance of last year with over 7,000 people expected at the conference. If the historical trend holds, bitcoin prices could grow by at least 50 percent during the conference and a further 100 percent rally till the start of summer.\nThis means bitcoin price could break the $10,000 mark this week and approach $16,000 by July. Though these figures are still shy of Tom Lee's $20,000 mid-year bitcoin price prediction .\nAltcoin prices have also had spectacular rallies during and after previous Consensus Conferences as they tend to follow Bitcoin. In 2017, the average altcoin price increase during the meeting was 176 percent while mean prices spiked by 552 percent in the two months that followed.\nPOTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS Historical figures are a vital analysis tool in the crypto market. However, the nascent nature of the industry makes it difficult to rely solely on these figures to establish a pattern.\nIt will be interesting to if the pattern holds as the situation in 2018 is a lot different from previous years with this year's record attendance and unprecedented global attention.\nThis year has also seen an increase in regulatory oversight measures from government and financial regulators. Meanwhile, negative rhetoric from naysayers like Warren Buffett , Bill Gates , Charlie Munger, etc., has particularly been in the news as of late, while South Korea appears to be widening its probe on crypto exchanges in the country.\nCrypto enthusiasts and traders, however, will have their fingers crossed hoping for history to repeat itself. The market waits with bated breath to see what becomes of it as Consensus begins.\nWill history repeat itself causing a bitcoin price rally during and after the Consensus Summit?

Hardly any assets have proved to be as mysterious and alluring as the new digital cryptocurrency has over the last few years, with millions of investors jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon in 2017 and sending its price to record highs. Despite being one of the most volatile and exciting assets on the market, bitcoin has risen from just under $1,000 at the start of 2017 to over $19,000 towards the end of the year. Here is all you need to know about the mystery that is Bitcoin.\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nBitcoin is known to be a ‘decentralised’ currency, meaning it is not tied to any central bank or government regulator. It’s a cryptocurrency that has no physical form and it exists only in a set of encrypted code. The creators wanted to introduce a new digital currency that was not regulated and could pass national borders. Bitcoin ‘miners’ crack complex sections of code known as ‘blockchain’ and that can be used as a payment method. The limit introduced by the creators are 21m bitcoins.\nIn its early days, very few businesses were keen on accepting the new cryptocurrency but as its success has increased, more and more began to take it as an acceptable form of payment. With its growing popularity, its price also rose and in equal measure the criticism and wariness from major financial institutions around the world. People are increasingly beginning to accept the idea of a decentralised currency.\nROLLERCOASTER\nIn its relatively short life so far bitcoin has experienced more volatility than many of its currency counterparts have seen in several decades. Bitcoin has gone through several rockets up in price that are closely followed by damaging crashes.\nOpinions are very varied on bitcoin’s rallies, some believe it’s just another flash in the pan and others that it may be the start towards being recognised as a global currency and viable alternative to centralised systems. Only time can tell.\nINVESTING IN BITCOIN\nEven though a single Bitcoin is currently heading towards more than $9,300, online trading platforms such as eToro allow users to engage in fractional trading, whereby sellers and buyers can agree prices based on values of less than one full Bitcoin. Like with any other investment, it is key to pick a strategy and stick to it, especially with an asset so volatile as bitcoin. Using the eToro platform, users can also view the actions of experienced Bitcoin traders and replicate their strategies to achieve the best results.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://track.adform.net/C/?bn=22748016"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pete southern", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T22:48:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b77008b60ea53261b514e8277a84acccdc1d46e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR26XuBpgwr.CRDdaTMvplEkJZPotqn6OwN4Dr8tV48no74cHWVAkU8FSkIh6ZL3VA7qc9zu2kFrBWqTbpghRTGnX60_Ns7niLWxCr_HolOww--", "site_full": "bestaltcoin.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bestaltcoin.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin and Altcoins News", "title": "Zimbabwe Bans Banks from All Bitcoin Dealings", "title_full": "Zimbabwe Bans Banks from All Bitcoin Dealings", "published": "2018-05-14T16:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b77008b60ea53261b514e8277a84acccdc1d46e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR26XuBpgwr.CRDdaTMvplEkJZPotqn6OwN4Dr8tV48no74cHWVAkU8FSkIh6ZL3VA7qc9zu2kFrBWqTbpghRTGnX60_Ns7niLWxCr_HolOww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ali Reza Rahbari (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T16:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zimbabwe Bans Banks from All Bitcoin Dealings", "text": "The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has banned financial institutions in the country from processing cryptocurrency transactions for cryptocurrency traders and investors despite growing interest in digital monetary assets in the country. “In order to safeguard the integrity, safety and soundness of the country’s financial system, and to protect the public in general, all financial institutions are hereby required to ensure that they do not use, trade, hold and/or transact in any way in virtual currencies,” the Zimbabwean central bank said in a circular to banks on Friday. The decision has sparked debate in Zimbabwe over the central bank’s heavy handedness in regulating cryptocurrencies in the country, which has for long struggled for foreign currency and liquidity amid cash shortages at the banks. In December 2017, the Apex Bank said in a circular to banks that it was risky to trade in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. From the circular: “As monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is the custodian of public trust and has an obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems. Cryptocurrencies have strong linkages and interconnectedness with standard means of payments and trading applications and rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system.” Golix is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platform in Zimbabwe, and it also hosts a bitcoin ATM at its Harare offices. Officials at Golix say bitcoin trade is growing in Zimbabwe as it helps plug financial shortages in the country. Although Golix is the most popular exchange platform for cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe, the central bank has identified other exchanges such as Styx24. The decision by the Zimbabwean central bank to prohibit banks from facilitating trade in cryptocurrencies, it said, stems from other “financial regulators around the world (who) have identified the dangers and risks presented by virtual currencies to financial stability which include risk of loss due to price volatility, theft or fraud, money laundering and other criminal” activities. “Further, cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate tax evasion as well as externalization of funds in violation of a country’s laws,” the bank said. This is in stark contrast to South Africa , which said this year it intended to tax cryptocurrencies.

What that means is, companies can have more efficient supply chains. They can cut their back and middle office costs and that will allow businesses to flow more efficiently and will allow cost to be cut and that savings to be passed along. We think blockchain will one of five key technologies along with automation, robotics, AI, and the Internet of Things,” said Chiavarone in an interview with CNBC . Big Banks are in Crypto Major banks such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America cooperate with large-scale conglomerates and enterprises to provide banking services, loans, and business solutions. Other than that, enterprises also work with third party service providers and spend millions of dollars on a quarterly basis for audits, reconciliation, and manual labor costs to sustain their supply chains and minor operations. Chiavarone stated that many major banks have started to invest heavily in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector to facilitate the growing demand from banks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Initially, bitcoin was the only way to access blockchain technology. Recently, Chiavarone stated that banks have started to explore a wide range of blockchain networks and technologies. “A lot of investors went into bitcoin first because it was the first way to access blockchain. Big banks are investing in this heavily. Bank of America boasted at Davos that they’re investing the most,” he added. Blockchain startups like Bluzelle have already built trusted blockchain networks for large-scale conglomerates such as HSBC, KPMG, Microsoft, and MUFG, which have also continued to leverage blockchain networks like Ethereum and Ripple through several blockchain consortia. Chiavarone emphasized that if blockchain startups and networks can succeed in replacing back offices, extensive labor, and eliminate costs involved in running supply chains, blockchain technology could lead the next industrial revolution. “Any company that runs supply chains can benefit from blockchain technology and it is some of the tech names that underlie that kind of technology. Whether it be Nvidia or Intel, or any kind of company that’s around processing power that enables blockchain verification or the beneficiaries of it [are good investments],” said Chiavarone, noting that merely investing in companies that may benefit from blockchain technology is a smart investment strategy. Cryptocurrency Startups Some of the world’s largest investment firms like Federated Investors are exploring the stocks of conglomerates like Intel and Nvidia that could merely benefit from blockchain technology. The sole beneficiaries of the growth of the blockchain sector including cryptocurrency businesses, blockchain startups, and blockchain networks will likely experience an exponential increase in value, as banks like Bank of America continue to drive investments into the space. https://www.ccn.com/big-banks-are-investing-heavily-in-blockchain-and-crypto-364-billion-investment-firm/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve chiavarone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park won-soon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiavarone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federated investors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:25:00.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88316414d14ee630c810077e3a6ed0b19dda1e3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR26XuBpgwr.CRDdaTMvplEkJZPotqn6OwN4Dr8tV48nnNmL1B8sEn4S1LtoahKZmFI8Ci1wd4O__baiGuZGUrUhMizPLjsTvlB60IC6BOirw--", "site_full": "bestaltcoin.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bestaltcoin.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin and Altcoins News", "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile", "published": "2018-05-14T16:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88316414d14ee630c810077e3a6ed0b19dda1e3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR26XuBpgwr.CRDdaTMvplEkJZPotqn6OwN4Dr8tV48nnNmL1B8sEn4S1LtoahKZmFI8Ci1wd4O__baiGuZGUrUhMizPLjsTvlB60IC6BOirw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ali Reza Rahbari (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T16:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile", "text": "The cryptocurrency market has dropped $9 billion over the past 24 hours after demonstrating a $30 billion increase in valuation from $370 to $400 billion. Bitcoin Struggle at $8,500 The bitcoin price has struggled to surpass the $8,500 mark on throughout May 14, even after surpassing $8,700 on May 13. The market started to recover as the bitcoin price rebounded to the $8,500 and tokens like Ontology (ONT) recorded gains in the 20 to 30 percent region, but the market failed to sustain momentum at the $400 billion mark. In an interview with The Express, cryptocurrency analyst and researcher Matthew Newton stated that major banks have already invested heavily in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, and the entire cryptocurrency market, echoing a similar stance as Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at $364 billion investment firm Federated Investors. In the short to mid-term, Newton emphasized that the entrance of banks could trigger institutional demand for cryptocurrency to rise, allowing the market to recover to its previous levels. “Despite some initial posturing, the reality is most big banks have already invested significant amounts in research and development into blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies themselves. It will still take time for institutional investors to fully come around – and the fact that Goldman won’t be buying or selling actual coins suggest some scepticism remains – but there’s a growing acceptance that these assets are here to stay,” said Newton. Many traders believe that the Blockchain Week in New York marked by the start of Consensus 2018 will help the bitcoin price recover and the market to rebound. Over the past week, the market has not been able to record any major movement on the upside and if the bitcoin price remains below the $8,500 mark, it is likely that other major cryptocurrencies and tokens will continue to slump throughout the week. But, if bitcoin can secure the $8,800 support level and eye a move towards $9,500 by the end of the week, the cryptocurrency market could experience a surge in volume and inflow of new capital. Already, the volume of the market has increased to around $21 billion, up by more than $5 billion since May 11. Depending on the volume, the bitcoin price could regain momentum and move towards the $8,800 mark or test the $8,000 resistance level in the short-term. Tokens Several tokens such as Salt, Ontology, and Storm have been able to record major gains against both bitcoin and US dollar over the past week. Considering that tokens experience intensified movements on both the upside and downside, the value of most tokens will depend on the short-term trend of bitcoin and Ethereum. With the bitcoin dominance index below 37 percent, it is evident that tokens and other small cryptocurrencies have started to outperform major digital assets. As the market conditions improve in the upcoming days, tokens like Ontology, Storm, and EOS that have strong volumes on major exchanges like Binance will likely perform well against bitcoin.

That’s because bitcoin was never meant to be an investment vehicle, but a peer to peer version of electronic cash. It was meant to send money worldwide between two parties without the intervention of a financial authority.\nThings were meant to be bought with bitcoin and sold in bitcoin. It wasn’t destined to end up in the hands of fresh-faced investors HODLing their stash of coins. There are few advisers out there who would tell you to go spend your stash right now. But if you want to buck the trend and actually use it as a currency, here are seven of the coolest things you can buy right now.\n1. A Round-The-World Cruise\nAssuming you’ve got enough bitcoins in your virtual wallet, you can spend them on a round-the-world cruise. And you’ve probably earned it after the roller coaster cryptocurrency year so far. Fancy a luxury trip to the Bahamas or a culture fix in Europe? You can get it all through Expedia . You can also pay for hotels, buy flights, and any of their other services in the exchange rate on the day.\nExpedia teams up with Coinbase to make paying in bitcoin easier, and the dollar to bitcoin conversion is as accurate as possible. Your price quote is valid for a maximum of 10 minutes, after which point you’ll have to request a new one.\nDespite bitcoin transactions being irreversible, should you repent after you spend, you can still seek a refund, but you won’t get digital funds back. So, if the value skyrockets after your purchase, you’ll have to suck it up in a champagne cocktail out on the open ocean.\n2. An Apartment in Dubai\nYou may have seen the headlines earlier this year. A flutter of excitement rippled through the crypto community as young investors contemplated the possibilities. Buying a slice of real estate heaven in the world’s most luxurious city. Aston Plaza & Residences sold 50 apartments in bitcoin in February, but the rest are only available in fiat.\nIf you still want to get your hands on some real estate using bitcoin, it’s actually not just a passing fad, despite the volatility. The world’s first cryptocurrency is still gaining traction in the real estate industry , with a new report from Re/Max Action First hailing bitcoin as the perfect fit for the property market.\nIn fact, beyond wealthy property magnates with deep pockets in the UAE, some 37 homes have already been listed on realtor.com so far by sellers accepting bitcoin payment. That includes a small Kansas home and a multi-million-dollar Hawaii mansion.\n3. A Political Scandal\nIf you like the thought of exposing corruption or seeing the rich and powerful squirm, you can donate your bitcoins to Wikileaks . Keep on reading Hillary’s emails, find out about espionage orders during the French elections, or simply support keeping an eye on Russia–your bitcoins and satoshi can help.\nDespite the rather mysterious nature of its founder, Wikileaks is a registered non-profit and as such, you can give bitcoin as an in-kind donation . That means that you can help fund this controversial truth crusader–and write it off for tax purposes as well.\n4. A College Education\nCumbria University in the United Kingdom became the world’s first public university to accept bitcoin as payment for tuition fees in 2014–and who said the British were resistant to change? They may not have been thrilled about the euro, but the UK is surprisingly bitcoin friendly.\nSo if you really want to spend your hard-earned bitcoins on furthering your education, there are a handful of other academic institutions globally that allow you to do that. The list includes Mexico’s Universidad de las Américas in Puebla and Switzerland’s Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\n5. Sushi\nBitcoin may be dwindling as a payment method for everyday items, but you can still purchase your sushi with it in a few places around the world. Of course, you have pretty much no incentive to do so, other than showing your friends what an early adopter you are.\nAnd while Bitcoin has been declared dead as a currency almost 300 times , if that’s really the case, you may as well cash in your satoshi on sashimi.\n6. Bath Bombs and Bubble Bars\nIf you want to lie back and relax in a bath full of bubbles, you can use your bitcoin to do so. The maker of bath bombs, bubble bars and all things delicious, Lush cosmetics, accepts bitcoin in payment for its products.\nFinance Manager Mike West declared on their website last year, “Accepting Bitcoin is very exciting for Lush. With Bitcoin, customers from all around the world will pay the same for our products, free from volatile currency fluctuations and lofty bank charges.” Clearly, he was holding a bath ball, and not a crystal one, at the time.\n7. A Diamond Ring\nFrom digital gold to real gold, if you’re really hooked on living the high life you may as well go all out and get yourself or your partner a diamond ring. REEDS Jewelers is more than happy to accept your bitcoin as payment jewelry and watches, either online or in any of their 65+ stores in the United States.\nBitcoin-Purchased Bliss\nThey say money can’t buy you happiness, but maybe bitcoin can. From luxury travel to a soak in the tub, you can still buy quite a few things with bitcoin. But, as with any other article you read on the subject, you should properly assess the risks first.\nBuying high-ticket items in volatile digital currency is not without its risks. So, while you hopefully won’t end up standing outside a property without the keys or the cash, it’s unlikely that a bank will be giving you a mortgage in bitcoin any time soon.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.remactionfirst.com/", "https://coincentral.com/what-should-charities-know-before-accepting-bitcoin-donations/", "https://www.sushifaq.com/basic-sushi-experience-information/sushi-restaurants-that-accept-bitcoin/", "https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opinions.ng%2F7-coolest-things-can-buy-bitcoin%2F", "https://www.ccn.com/lingerie-tycoon-sells-50-luxury-dubai-apartments-bitcoin/", "https://wikileaks.org/", "https://www.expedia.com/", "https://www.reeds.com/bitcoin.html", "https://uk.lush.com/article/doing-our-bitcoin-lush-digital-accepts-cryptocurrency", "https://coincentral.com/7-of-the-coolest-things-you-can-buy-with-bitcoin/", "http://twitter.com/share?text=7+of+The+Coolest+Things+You+Can+Buy+with+Bitcoin&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opinions.ng%2F7-coolest-things-can-buy-bitcoin%2F", "http://www.idioms.in/", "https://coincentral.com/blockchain-real-estate-selling-property-is-getting-easier/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christina comben when sa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahamas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T17:48:58.085+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "160983be63bf4f9824b05e918f0cae42be46c381", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR26XuBpgwr.CRDdaTMvplEkJZPotqn6OwN4Dr8tV48nmbXtwA8mQBF_F5PZAlFkMAazVZtJixIvENW_cg6O7DlndsS5BwxRri3KDcUB_E4lQ--", "site_full": "bestaltcoin.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bestaltcoin.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin and Altcoins News", "title": "MMA Title Challenger Mei Yamaguchi Sponsored by Bitcoin Cash Fan Roger Ver", "title_full": "MMA Title Challenger Mei Yamaguchi Sponsored by Bitcoin Cash Fan Roger Ver", "published": "2018-05-14T16:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "160983be63bf4f9824b05e918f0cae42be46c381", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR26XuBpgwr.CRDdaTMvplEkJZPotqn6OwN4Dr8tV48nmbXtwA8mQBF_F5PZAlFkMAazVZtJixIvENW_cg6O7DlndsS5BwxRri3KDcUB_E4lQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ali Reza Rahbari (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T16:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "MMA Title Challenger Mei Yamaguchi Sponsored by Bitcoin Cash Fan Roger Ver", "text": "MMA fighter Mei Yamaguchi from Japan is set to fight Angela Lee for the Atomweight World Championship title at One Championship’s ‘Unstoppable Dreams’ in Singapore and, bitcoin cash promoter Roger Ver will be sponsoring her in that match. In a video announcing the sponsorship deal, Ver sat down with Yamaguchi to discuss MMA and cryptocurrencies. He was excited to demonstrate how Bitcoin Cash worked and sent her $1,000 in bitcoin cash (0.0642 BCH) in real time. Yamaguchi, in turn, discussed her MMA career. “I am the CEO of Bitcoin.com, and we are proud to sponsor Mei for this fight cause we want the whole world to know what a great athlete she is and she wants the whole world to know what a great currency bitcoin cash is,” Ver said.\nYamaguchi, who grew up in California initially learned karate after being inspired by Jackie Chan films. Then, she began practicing ju-jitsu and went on to become a mixed martial arts fighter. She now has 27 professional fights under her belt, with a 16-10-1 record. Towards the end of their sit-down, Roger Ver displayed Yamaguchi’s bitcoin cash address for people to donate. This wallet address is different from the wallet Roger Ver initially sent $1,000, and t the time of writing this article, the wallet only has 23 transactions and a total of 0.053 BCH ($77) in it. This is not the first time a cryptocurrency is being used to sponsor and promote Sports. In January 2018, Dash sponsored MMA fighter Rory MacDonald for his fight against Douglas Lima. Rory was paid 320 DASH ($271,000 at the time) for promoting the coin. He went on to win the fight and claim the Welterweight gold title for himself. Fans of another cryptocurrency — dogecoin — have crowdfunded multiple athletic sponsorships over the years. In 2014, Dogecoin raised $50,000 for the Jamaican Bobsled Team which had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but could not afford to go to Sochi, Russia. In the same year, the community successfully raised $55,000 to sponsor NASCAR driver Josh Wise. Wise took part in the event in a car which had Dogecoin branding and finished in the fifteenth position.

It was the first to use bitcoin to transfer credit in currency internationally, not only as loan collateral, and it’s currently processing about $1 million in loan payments per month. As the company explains on its website: “By innovating in the fields of payments and credit scoring, Bitbond makes financial inclusion a reality around the world. All payment transactions on Bitbond are conducted via the bitcoin blockchain. Therefore our service is available worldwide via the internet and is independent of banks.” While many outsiders (and even hodlers) see bitcoin as only a highly speculative asset , Bitbond has found a business model that competes with traditional systems. Using bitcoin came as a smart move for Albrecht as an alternative to the Swift payment system, which is slower and more expensive. “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Source: Shutterstock The downside, according to Albrecht, is the coin’s volatility. As CCN reported in December, businesses are reluctant to accept bitcoin as payment because of its wildly shifting exchange rates. Bitbond avoids this issue because clients only posses the tokens for their loans for a few seconds or minutes until it’s ready to be exchanged to the national currency that they prefer. Bitcoin’s core premises of cheap transfer and low fees drive the business’ success. Since 2013, Bitbond has grown in popularity. The company has been mentioned in Forbes and Lend Academy. The news has been stayed positive, with VC funding Currently, Bitbond employs 24 people from 12 countries. The lean team takes care of the bank’s 100 clients, which bring in $1 million each month. The clients are mostly made up of small businesses and freelancers who do not exceed loans over $50,000. The company also became officially licensed as a bank in 2016, solidifying its longevity and successful track record Germany is a global forerunner in Bitcoin adoption. While other countries remain skeptical and enact anti-crypto regulation, such as India, Germany, along with the United States, is open to crypto-related businesses. Germany is second to the United States, according to Bitnodes, a service that tracks the transfer information broadcast by Bitcoin nodes.
