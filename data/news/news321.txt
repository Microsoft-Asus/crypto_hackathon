This is an all too familiar popular phrase that is used as a general way of dealing with situations where you cannot control your oponent. In this case, the Federal Reserve of the United States might be destined to make a similar decision when it comes to dealing with Bitcoin (BTC) and the entire cryptocurrency industry. Anyone who is knee deep in this crypto and blockchain industry understands and knows that both entities are the future of investing, payment settlement and so many possibilities on the blockchain. A former top official of the Federal Reserve has seen the proverbial light and is also echoing this sentiment. Former Governor of the US Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, had this to say about crypto: Most central banks have a view that these crypto-assets are clever, like guys in the garage did it and it’s kind of cool, or risky…to think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin. Not that it would supplant and replace cash, but it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy This is some good news given the already known news that Venezuela has led the way with the Petro and China is considering its own State backed crypto to counter the current influx of regular cryptocurencies in its economies that could threaten their valuable Yuan. State control is something that the Chinese government wants due to the current political system in the country. The Communist party is firm in its ways to protect the well being of its citizens and the nation in general. One thing is for sure, once a FedCoin is considered, possible ways to back it would be through already present paper USD money, or the oil reserves in the country or even the Gold that everyone believes is in Fort Knox . A portion of the total FedCoin would be in circulation for the masses and possibly be used as legal tender. The Feds would then continue monitoring inflation and deflation like they would with regular fiat money. This would then challenge the King of Crypto – BTC – head on! Like two bulls in a fight. In conclusion, the world is changing through crypto and blockchain. Any government that does not have a taskforce to investigate a way forward, will be left behind as the rest of the world evolves and benefits through the new technology.", "highlightText": "",

May 10, 2018\nExchanges are the crux of any currency, stock. Exchanges play a major role in a currency’s lifetime, they help recognize the value of a currency and further help transact the currency in the market.\nThe US economy is highly dependent on its stock market exchanges. It is how men belonging to every economic class make money over their primary income. Millions of Americans are dependent on the stock market as their primary wealth-building tool. Without it, the ‘American dream’ would be even more unachievable than it is today.\nExchanges offer people a chance to invest in products, technology, and currencies that they believe in, it is how individuals, companies, and the economy grows financially. It connects the economy and allows people to grow at a higher pace with access to more capital.\nConsidering the importance of exchanges and the amount of money that exchanges host one believes its safety is of at most importance. The security must be well wrapped around an exchange so that the investment, the dream does not collapse.\nThe Cryptocurrency exchanges have not been as successful as the stock market exchanges in maintaining the digital security as required by an exchange considering it has developed in a time of decentralization, a more secure technological era. Before the readers start arguing in defense of Cryptocurrency exchanges, let’s look at some facts.\nThe stock market exchanges in the past have been hacked through the modes of phishing, the stock market exchanges run on a private network and the only available hacking tool is phishing. It allows hackers to access the data of the internal server. In the past, the US SEC has reported that their EDGAR was compromised multiple times.\nIn a statement, Clayton, the chairman of SEC said:\n“The system that was breached, known as EDGAR, is a popular way for investors to access the detailed financial reports companies that sell stock to the public must periodically release. It had a ‘software vulnerability’ that was exploited and resulted in access to nonpublic information.”\nAt the time, Clayton further added:\n“The breach didn’t lead to the release of personally identifiable information but may have provided the basis for illicit gain through trading. An investigation into the matter is ongoing.”\nSuch a type of hack in simple terms allows users to access non-public information prior to it becoming public and also allows them to generate fake information, giving them an advantage over the market.\nThe cybersecurity has been updated multiple times after such attacks and has become more secure but the point to notice here is that the government allows bailout on certain hacks and also that the security breach is fixed in a matter of hours.\nCryptocurrency exchanges have also been under attack multiple times, Bitfinex lost $72 million in 2016, Bitstamp reported that $5 million was stolen from the exchange in 2015, and Mt. Gox was also hacked. The thing common between these exchanges is that all of them operate on the same structure as stock market exchanges. They all utilize an internal server and third-party servers to host exchanges. They are centralized.\nHacking a cryptocurrency exchange is easy for many reasons. Firstly, they do not really hack the entire exchange but access the wallets of users and then utilize the stored fiat currency to purchase cryptocurrency and transfer it out. Next, the complicated process of storing cryptocurrency over a wide range of wallets which seem complicated to an everyday layman investor to differentiate between makes it easier for the hackers to make use of their vulnerability.\nBitcoin evangelists recommend steering clear of centralized exchanges, arguing that the whole point of decentralized currencies was to not hand over control to third parties, such as central banks, commercial banks, and exchanges, which raises the risk of mismanagement, scams or hacking.\nExperts say only money needed for upcoming transactions should be kept in hot wallets. Even then, trading one cryptocurrency for another can be done over decentralized exchanges, such as Shapeshift, Changelly or Waves Dex, directly from the holder’s wallet and not from a wallet controlled by an exchange in their name.\nRisks of fraud or hacking then only occur when a holder wants to exchange crypto assets for fiat currencies, but these can be minimized. Transactions can be done peer-to-peer in a safe, public place amongst members of the local crypto community rated by reputation on websites such as localbitcoins.com or via a centralized exchange, with the risk of hacking limited to the amount of time spent online to perform the transaction.\nRecently an investor, Kevin Pham reported,\n“Mt. Gox Hack, 750,000 BTC lost, No Bailout Bitstamp Hack, 19,000 BTC lost, No Bailout Bitfinex Hack, 120,000 BTC lost, No Bailout”\nSuch losses are of a huge concern because the entire argument of the crypto world is that it provides a safer, decentralized form of currency.\nYet another investor suggested the following precautions,\n“Never lose control of your seeds. Never input them into a close sourced wallet. Never reuse them after inputting them. Always move coins before attempting to split a fork. Never keep all your coins in one wallet.”\nNotably, he lost his Bitcoins while attempting to collect a fork. He tried all his old seeds, nothing happened and he forgot to move his BTC first and input his latest seed.\nBy now if you are new to cryptocurrency, you would have lost your way and be highly confused. That’s exactly why the crypto exchanges are more vulnerable than other traditional exchanges as the jargons and the complicated process causes people to make mistakes, these mistakes leave them wide open to hacks.\nIn January, Fortune reported instances where people were vulnerable and lost money as they did not understand the difference between hot wallet which is connected to the internet and cold wallet which is offline.\nBesides the point that the exchanges must be decentralized as a centralized exchange beats the point of a decentralized currency, it needs to be more easy to use and understand.\nThere lies an ideological difference between a centralized crypto exchange and a traditional exchange market. The government interference turns the light on the little, ordinary guy in traditional exchange markets, enabling a certain amount of security. The governments across the globe are trying to regulate the cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure little guy’s security.\nFor example, Japan’s government recognized bitcoin as a legally accepted means of payment and required exchange operators to register with the financial regulator.\nThe move which came in the wake of the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the then largest bitcoin exchange was designed to protect consumers and clamp down on illegal use of cryptocurrencies. It also formed part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push to stimulate growth via the fintech sector.\nThe Financial Services Authority’s requirements for would-be exchanges include robust computer systems and segregation of cash and cryptocurrency accounts, checks on traders’ identities and risk management systems.\nIn addition to this, the cryptocurrency community is also putting its best foot forward to make cryptocurrency more accessible and easy to use through its revolutionary wallets and crypto debit cards.\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Nick Colas , a wall street analyst said that any new technology requires new money to flow in to cross its saturation point in reference to Bitcoin. He asked investors to be cautious as the rate at which new investors are coming in has reduced over the period of time.\nThe above issues and the comments of Nick Colas help us draw a parallel between the two issues. If cryptocurrencies manage to make transactions, exchanges and investments as easy as say, mutual funds, fiat currency exchange, stock market exchange and provide the public with the ultimate security of a decentralized platform that it was set out to give it will see a lot more investment from the various economic classes across the globe.\n[Author’s Opinion]\nGiven the nature of cryptocurrency being in between a security and a mode of payment.\nThe day a common man working 9-5 who does not have much understanding of technology and just wants to utilize his savings can invest without the need of going through jargons and also perform cryptocurrency transactions without worrying about how and where should he store it with the security that a decentralized currency promises, Cryptocurrency will enter the mainstream. This will, in turn, bring in new money that Nick Colas talks about into the cryptocurrency market.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T07:23:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42b57629ebd96c551b706598e10a8b828acc9f0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDlcDL.Laxwtq2hAngUKbGPMqvTqC50ulSHcEqkqN4Mii0PLhnI_w7g577mDIj5sM8rrUFuGEq9_lYbGd2jsWtUecry5W4uC6FenBJJ0SIEy5m", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ahmedabad News, Latest Ahmedabad News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "CID seizes bitcoins worth Rs 7.30 crore | Ahmedabad News", "title_full": "CID seizes bitcoins worth Rs 7.30 crore | Ahmedabad News - Times of India", "published": "2018-05-10T02:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.471, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42b57629ebd96c551b706598e10a8b828acc9f0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDlcDL.Laxwtq2hAngUKbGPMqvTqC50ulSHcEqkqN4Mii0PLhnI_w7g577mDIj5sM8rrUFuGEq9_lYbGd2jsWtUecry5W4uC6FenBJJ0SIEy5m", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2018-05-10T02:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "CID seizes bitcoins worth Rs 7.30 crore | Ahmedabad News", "text": "AHMEDABAD: CID crime probing the multi crore bitcoin case have recovered 119 bitcoins worth Rs 7.30 crore from the Binance wallet of Kirit Paladiya , who was arrested last week and is currently in CID custody on police remand.\nInterestingly, CID crime had to trick the Binance company to seize the bitcoins which are virtual currency.\n“As soon as we raised a query about the Bianance e-wallet of Kirit Paladiya, the company froze his account and we could not access it.

We grabbed the opportunity and opened it with the password and user ID given to us by Paladiya during interrogation, and immediately changed the user ID and password. The virtual currency is in our custody,” said a senior CID crime official.\nMeanwhile, CID crime has also launched a search to locate Dhaval Mavani (Patel), the administrator of the bitcoin investment company who was allegedly kidnapped on February 1, 2018. Kidnappers posing as I-T officials had extorted 2,300 bitcoins worth over Rs 1,300 crore from him at gunpoint.\n“We have gathered his travel manifest.

We are in contact with central agencies to bring Mavani back to India to expose the alleged Rs 1,300 crore scam,” said a senior CID crime official.CID officials said they are also looking for Piyush Savaliya, who claims that he was not kidnapped. “We have to question him and soon we will track him and summon him for questioning,” a CID crime official said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dhaval mavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirit paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ahmedabad news", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T02:36:10.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15cbcd57e72c4a88c2c2fb9318211ff94b661454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdb8DuikEHxpdJiowJzK5PLdSOGTdAyRTYmBEqrSrUXxAUSqAb5HJOfI37nOO648Y5ROuBz9393TaolIXKZpDGIAmo2JEy_L5g--", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Japan’s Bitcoin King Poaches Wall Street Talent for Crypto Empire", "title_full": "Japan’s Bitcoin King Poaches Wall Street Talent for Crypto Empire", "published": "2018-05-10T02:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1200x800-3-1024x683.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15cbcd57e72c4a88c2c2fb9318211ff94b661454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdb8DuikEHxpdJiowJzK5PLdSOGTdAyRTYmBEqrSrUXxAUSqAb5HJOfI37nOO648Y5ROuBz9393TaolIXKZpDGIAmo2JEy_L5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-10T02:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Japan’s Bitcoin King Poaches Wall Street Talent for Crypto Empire", "text": "Yuzo Kano is trying to build a global cryptocurrency powerhouse, one former financier at a time. The\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. alumnus, who turned\nbitFlyer Inc. into Japan’s largest Bitcoin exchange, is scooping up traders and bankers from both his old employer and former rivals as he embarks on an ambitious international expansion.\nKano’s team, which includes a former fixed-income desk head at\nBarclays Plc and an ex-senior private banker at\nCredit Suisse Group AG, has doubled to more than 150 people in the past six months and is on pace to top 300 before year-end. While he’s far from the only crypto boss to poach talent from Wall Street firms, Kano has been among the most aggressive in taking advantage of recent Japanese regulations that make the finance-to-crypto leap less daunting.\nThe nation’s virtual currency exchanges are now licensed by Japan’s securities watchdog, giving the venues an official stamp of approval that’s largely absent from countries like the U.S. and Britain. For Kano, that makes Japan the ideal base for a growing global operation.\n“My target is to be number one in the world,” the former derivatives and convertible bonds trader said in an interview from his office in Midtown Tower, the tony Tokyo skyscraper that’s also home to Blackstone Group and Bain & Co. “To get there, I need to grow headcount.\nAnd those with the best skills come from global banks.” Read more about Japan’s unique crypto exchange regulations here. Kano’s four-year-old exchange is already the world’s fourth largest crypto venue by turnover, after BitMex, Binance and OKEx, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from exchanges, Coinhills and Coinmarketcap.com.

However, he doesn’t seem to believe that the latter will be bitcoin.’ ‘Not a big believer in bitcoin’\nIn an interview for CNBC on Tuesday, Gary Cohn said that he believes there will be a global cryptocurrency. He also shared that he’s not a Bitcoin believer but he does favor its underlying technology.\nHe said:\nI’m not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology. […] I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it’s not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that. ‘It Will Probably Have Some Blockchain Technology’\nExplaining his vision for the future global cryptocurrency, Cohn adds profound arguments of the kind:\nIt will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency […] It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it.\nIs Bitcoin that complex, though? Bitcoin successfully eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries–like Goldman Sachs–and makes long-distance transfers cheaper and more secure.\nOf course, it has run into a lot of issues along the way. Bitcoin mining truly is very energy-intensive, it has problems with handling high volumes of transactions and it has become slower as such. It’s also true that there are currently existing alternatives which perform better in certain aspects.\nHowever, ignoring the facts that Bitcoin is the first of its kind and that it has been field tested for almost a decade, proving its usability and performance capabilities in the process, is just inappropriate. What is more, Cohn’s old firm seems to have quite a lot of faith in Bitcoin itself. Goldman Sachs Recognizing Bitcoin’s Impact\nEarlier this month, Rana Yared, an executive at Cohn’s ex-firm, said that Bitcoin “is not a fraud”. What is more, she also seems to have revealed the bank’s intentions to offer Bitcoin trading. In a definitive statement, she noted:\nIt resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.\nFurthermore, responding to significant client interest, the bank has already hired crypto trader who will help the company expand into the markets for digital assets. The news came as no surprise, though, as the minimum trading sizes for Bitcoin , as well as other cryptocurrencies, had doubled up.\nIt’s obvious that Cohn’s ex-employer is deviating from the position of the former president, to which he responded briefly:\nThey should do what they think’s in the best interests of their shareholders.\nDo you think Bitcoin has what it takes to become a global cryptocurrency?

Darren Marble, CEO of&a;nbsp;CrowdfundX is one of them. &q;Although Warren Buffet has made the right call on many investments, he is dead wrong on Bitcoin, because he is totally clueless to the technology,&a;rdquo; says Marble. &a;ldquo;How could someone who doesn&s;t use email possibly appreciate Bitcoin? They can&s;t.&a;rdquo;\nMarble points to the strong performance of Bitcoin vis-&a;agrave;-vis Berkshire Hathaway over the last three years. &a;ldquo;For the record, if you had invested in Berkshire Hathaway stock three years ago, you would be sitting on a 30% profit, whereas had you invested in Bitcoin&a;nbsp;in three years&a;nbsp;ago, you would have done 100 times better literally.&q;\nAnd he makes a stark prediction. &a;ldquo;Years from now, when the dust settles, Warren Buffett&s;s miss on Bitcoin will be the biggest miss of his career and will make his misses on Amazon and Google look forgivable.&q;\nDaniel Rice, Chief Technology Officer of Sagewise, is another cryptocurrency expert that takes issue with Mr. Buffett. &q;We disagree with Warren Buffet that Bitcoin is a zero-sum game,&a;rdquo; says Rice.&a;ldquo;While it&a;rsquo;s true that Bitcoin acts differently from more traditional investments, this is not a negative in our view. Too often traditional investors forget Bitcoin is actually a technology infrastructure.&a;rdquo;\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\nDaniel Worsley, COO of LocalCoinSwap, agrees. &a;ldquo;Bitcoin has fueled huge amounts of innovation over the last few years. Its revolutionary blockchain technologies have shown that there are alternatives to many industries and assets,&a;rdquo; says Worsley. &a;ldquo;Money, Insurance, contracts, computing power and even voting are now more fair and efficient all thanks to Bitcoin and the blockchain.&a;rdquo;\n&a;ldquo;Warren Buffet has in the past quoted that you should &a;lsquo;invest in what you know&a;rsquo;.

(BTCRUSH) and Forex EA & Bitcoin Investment LLC — are accused of promising unrealistic returns.\nThus far, the Board has brought actions against nine cryptocurrency-related companies, including the aforementioned.\nFrom CCN :\nJoseph Rotunda, Director of the Enforcement Division at the Texas State Securities Board, told CCN that the latest emergency orders were part of a sweep that the agency launched at year-end 2017 when the bitcoin price was trading in the stratosphere. The sweep targets projects that raise red flags and that are promoting to Texas residents. The number of open investigations into cryptocurrency startups including ICOs has doubled since that time, from about 30 to approximately 60.\n“We’ve seen this before when a new market emerges and people want to get rich quick at the expense of others. They infiltrate the market we are trying to weed out those folks. Their schemes are very fragile, like a house of cards waiting to tumble. Something comes along to offers that gust of wind and everything collapses,” Rotunda told CCN.\nIn Texas, that gust of wind is increasingly taking the form of emergency cease-and-desist orders.\nThe suspect return promises included a “100% satisfaction guarantee” along with the freedom to change the interest terms at will at BTCRUSH.\nRotunda told CCN:\n“They weren’t just putting out a website and letting investors come to them. They weren’t just discussing investments on a message board. Their sales agents were specifically advertising and sending materials to Texas residents. They were communicating, ‘come to our website, register an account, purchase an investment.”\nNon-compliance with the cease and desist orders could result in up to a decade in a Texas prison.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/texas-securities-regulator-issues-two-emergency-orders-to-crypto-firms/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph rotunda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forex ea & bitcoin investment llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas state securities board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin trading & cloud mining ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T05:02:14.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a262e08ced5bffc8f16f6d138f9dd8cd4ee489cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0ll_t8WSZjwNKYkvzDCzyCzCzJT_rRcWOO70yURRbuentx7M8X4hYrlxv4OSCMCqBHpiDQbpwUIB1MzUaJT2sjrU9VfnVhfweR7GOgKTQXIRzVOJF_7X6RmAstfEci7_qFm0y4rEfIQ--", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128821153.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ahmedabad News, Latest Ahmedabad News Headlines & Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Bitcoin scam: Kotadiya seeks time from CID", "title_full": "Bitcoin scam: Kotadiya seeks time from CID", "published": "2018-05-10T01:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a262e08ced5bffc8f16f6d138f9dd8cd4ee489cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0ll_t8WSZjwNKYkvzDCzyCzCzJT_rRcWOO70yURRbuentx7M8X4hYrlxv4OSCMCqBHpiDQbpwUIB1MzUaJT2sjrU9VfnVhfweR7GOgKTQXIRzVOJF_7X6RmAstfEci7_qFm0y4rEfIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T01:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin scam: Kotadiya seeks time from CID", "text": "AHMEDABAD: Former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya , who has ducked CID summonses twice, faxed CID crime and asked for time till May 11 or 12 to appear before them.

AHMEDABAD: CID crime probing the multi crore bitcoin case have recovered 119 bitcoins worth Rs 7.30 crore from the Binance wallet of Kirit Paladiya , who was arrested last week and is currently in CID custody on police remand. Interestingly, CID crime had to trick the Binance company to seize the bitcoins which are virtual currency. “As soon as we raised a query about the Bianance e-wallet of Kirit Paladiya, the company froze his account and we could not access it. However, when we wrote to the company that the account has now been rendered useless for us, the company reactivated the account. We grabbed the opportunity and opened it with the password and user ID given to us by Paladiya during interrogation, and immediately changed the user ID and password. The virtual currency is in our custody,” said a senior CID crime official. Meanwhile, CID crime has also launched a search to locate Dhaval Mavani (Patel), the administrator of the bitcoin investment company who was allegedly kidnapped on February 1, 2018. Kidnappers posing as I-T officials had extorted 2,300 bitcoins worth over Rs 1,300 crore from him at gunpoint. “We have gathered his travel manifest. Mavani had left India on February 15, 2018 for Singapore, when all bitcoin transactions related to the kidnapping drama were taking place. We are in contact with central agencies to bring Mavani back to India to expose the alleged Rs 1,300 crore scam,” said a senior CID crime official.CID officials said they are also looking for Piyush Savaliya, who claims that he was not kidnapped. “We have to question him and soon we will track him and summon him for questioning,” a CID crime official said.

That was according to a speed camera citation mailed to him that said his Opel Astra (which is sold in the United States as the Chevy Cruze) was clocked doing 654 kilometers per hour in a 50 kph zone. The ticket came with a fine for 6,579 euros (approximately $7,800), but he didn’t have to pay it. According to DriveTribe, he brought the matter to the police and they admitted the malfunction and let him off the hook. — Fox News\nMayor arrested on DWI, gun charges hours after election win\nRobert Williams Jr. spent the night in jail — just hours after he was elected mayor of a small town in eastern North Carolina.

The National Sleep Foundation found some married couples choose to get a better night’s rest by sleeping apart. “Sometimes it’s so loud you just laugh, you know that’s all you can do,” said Nancy Scott. Scott tries to keep a sense of humor when it comes to her husband’s snoring. “I tried a new set of ear plugs last night. Well, they fell out,” she said. After too many restless nights, the Bloomington, Minn., couple decided it was time to sleep in separate rooms. — CBS4 Minnesota\nPlans appear to be moving forward for Miami-Dade mega mall\nA mega mall and entertainment complex in northwest Miami-Dade that would dwarf any other appears to be on course for approval, but not without controversy. It’s called the American Dream. It would be the largest mall in the world. A shopping and entertainment complex is slated to go up on vacant land south of where the Florida Turnpike and I-75 meet near Broward County. — CBS4 Miami\nThe wealthy are hoarding $10 billion of Bitcoin in bunkers\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete sit the encrypted computer servers — connected to nothing — that hold keys to a vast digital fortune. Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. — Bloomberg React to this story:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/05/08/plans-moving-forward-miami-dade-mega-mall/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin", "http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2018/05/09/driver-issued-7800-ticket-for-going-over-400-mph.html", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/09/north-carolina-mayor-arrested-on-dwi-gun-charges-hours-after-election-win.html", "http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/05/08/i-have-more-energy-1-in-4-couples-sleep-apart-for-better-rest/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "drivetribe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert williams jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chevy cruze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daily citizen-news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opel astra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T02:40:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "567a579c0a32a3c1f7b7a96281cb85d529316493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.soYq5r59CLqHq977.4MibFBNtBnEtn79zfTBHLJdTjfQX8NJXhIJLM8YwhNLsUcmxw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "No wonder they talk bad about bitcoin.

The course of action aids in confirming that enough computational effort is devoted to a block. The approach also creates new Bitcoins in every single block. Get extra details about crypto news To mine you ought to have a look at the transactions inside a block and then verify their validity. You must then pick one of the most current transactions inside the header of your most current block and insert them into the new block as a hash. Before a brand new block is added for the local blockchain, you need to solve the proof of perform problem. This can be a issue that's made to make sure that the new block to be developed is hard along with the data employed in creating the block satisfies the laid down requirements. Bitcoin makes use of the Hashcash proof of perform; for that reason, for you personally to resolve the problem you will need to create a hash. Ways to build a hash Should you understand how to do it it is pretty easy to produce a hash from a collection of Bitcoin blocks. The unfortunate point is that you cannot work out the data by just looking at the hash-you will need to test various blocks. Hashes are found in the blocks and also you must combine them to prove that your information is genuine. You'll find some miners who attempt to take the easy route by attempting to fake a transaction by altering an already stored block. You must note that every hash is exceptional and particular to a provided block; as a result, whenever you manipulate a given block, you change the hash. When a offered miner runs a hashtag function around the manipulated block, the block is located to become fake, and also you will not get any rewards. Mining reward If you successfully resolve a proof of work, you get a mining reward. The number of Bitcoins inside the reward is determined by several things which include complexity on the trouble. For you to make additional income you need to solve numerous problems. You also will need to possess higher speed computers to allow you to solve as a lot of difficulties as you can. Currently, mining pools have sprung up and are identified on a really straightforward notion. Here a group of miners come collectively and work on quite a few blocks. As soon as the problem is solved, the miners share the rewards. Conclusion With all the right facts and tools Bitcoin mining isn't only rewarding, it really is also a exciting and secure method to transfer funds across the online world. To produce as a lot cash as you can you need to have the proper software program and potent computer system hardware. # # #", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T11:17:07.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c171adb24b28dad26d2c33b78bf9ae7c9482dd21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkGTLGkzyMG.QYzSNjBm8BwRoL8x7tzTDnB5vTDTjbNIaxaL6ddjHfv5Dc6TDFqi3TdqM8TlKZh.uoMRBmFIWPzU_23zdaQtnauZmqXzxQX73I.4CtvIBtH.vHlmabMhTvPGy.c05LWA--", "site_full": "forum.hardware.fr", "site": "hardware.fr", "site_section": "https://forum.hardware.fr/hfr/Discussions/liste_sujet-1.htm", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Discussions - FORUM HardWare.fr", "title": "Blockchain et Cryptomonnaie • Bitcoin , Ethereum, etc 1820 - Société", "title_full": "Blockchain et Cryptomonnaie • Bitcoin , Ethereum, etc - Page : 1820 - Société - Discussions - FORUM HardWare.fr", "published": "2018-05-10T01:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8627, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c171adb24b28dad26d2c33b78bf9ae7c9482dd21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkGTLGkzyMG.QYzSNjBm8BwRoL8x7tzTDnB5vTDTjbNIaxaL6ddjHfv5Dc6TDFqi3TdqM8TlKZh.uoMRBmFIWPzU_23zdaQtnauZmqXzxQX73I.4CtvIBtH.vHlmabMhTvPGy.c05LWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "karionstre", "published": "2018-05-10T01:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockchain et Cryptomonnaie • Bitcoin , Ethereum, etc 1820 - Société", "text": "drap", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:51:04.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c97966e14d48c869c7c1173044f95e39824fece3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYDm7f0EDI.LyG5yywOWdD_Sy4chLgfqPgPm6AALNwEmCtMdKpbvgNmZ8bIf5GhVTEE-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Hovers Near 1-Week Lows", "title_full": "Bitcoin Hovers Near 1-Week Lows", "published": "2018-05-10T01:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PRqyfSjm3u05cEjY5HnpXg--~B/aD0yODY7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/81c4cb8962f1880494f0c798b55da950", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c97966e14d48c869c7c1173044f95e39824fece3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYDm7f0EDI.LyG5yywOWdD_Sy4chLgfqPgPm6AALNwEmCtMdKpbvgNmZ8bIf5GhVTEE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T01:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Hovers Near 1-Week Lows", "text": "Investing.com - Bitcoin struggled to recover on Wednesday after three straight days of declines that were fueled by a barrage of critiques from the investment world.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped following the criticism from the legendary investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger . This time, even the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates opined that he would short Bitcoin if he could. Contrary to his opinion, Microsoft continues to be supportive towards blockchain and cryptocurrency. While these statements might scare away a few investors planning to invest into digital currencies and result in a short-term dip, it is not going to have any material difference in the long-term trend. A few months down the line, these dips will be hardly even noticed on the charts. The New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange is considering the possibility to allow their clients to buy and hold Bitcoin. This shows that the traditional investors from Wall Street are warming up to the idea of investing in cryptocurrencies and it is only a matter of time before volumes increase. Gary Cohn, former chief economic advisor to US President Donald Trump believes that there will be a global cryptocurrency in the future, but it won’t be Bitcoin. BTC/USD On May 09, Bitcoin momentarily dipped below both the 20-day EMA and the small trendline support but it did not hit our stops at $8,900. Currently, the BTC/USD pair has again pulled back above the $9,000 levels, which is a positive development. This shows that the buyers are still keen to support prices at lower levels. Now, the bulls might attempt a rally back to $10,000 levels, which is a critical resistance. The digital currency will gain strength only above $10,000. On the downside, a confirmed break below the $9,000 levels will result in a drop to the 50-day SMA. The RSI has formed a negative divergence which is a bearish sign. We suggest maintaining the stops at $8,900 for now, we shall trail it higher in a couple of days. ETH/USD Ethereum has slowly clawed back to our purchase price. It should break out and sustain above the $745 levels to signal strength. A failure to do so will result in another retest of the 20-day EMA, which is currently at $693. A breakout above $745 can carry the ETH/USD pair to $838, which is the May 05 highs. Above this level, a rally close to $900 is possible. Though our target objective is $1,130, we shall take it one level at a time. On the downside, a slide below the May 07 lows of $685.18 will signal weakness. Therefore, we recommend raising the stops higher from $640 to $680. Let’s reduce our risk. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash broke below the support line of the ascending channel and triggered our proposed stop loss on half of the position at $1,500 . The stops on the remaining half kept at $1,400 is still intact. Currently, the BCH/USD pair has climbed back into the channel and has broken out of $1,600, which is a positive move. If it sustains above $1,600, a rally back to the May 06 highs of $1,849 should be on the cards. Above this, the rally should extend to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $2,000. On the downside, a breakdown of the 20-day EMA will signal weakness. Therefore, we recommend holding the remaining position with the stops at $1,400. XRP/USD Ripple continues to trade inside the range of $0.76-$0.93777. Currently, prices are bouncing off the lower end of the range. If the support holds, we should see a move back towards the upper end of the range. However, we already have a few open positions, which are close to our buy levels. Hence, we need to wait for a couple of days before recommending a long position in it. A breakdown of the range gives the XRP/USD pair a pattern target of $0.58223 on the downside. Inside the range, trading will continue to be volatile. XLM/USD Stellar is trying to hold the 20-day EMA. If successful, it can rally back towards the $0.47766719 levels, which will form a cup and handle formation. A break below the 20-day EMA can extend the decline to the next support level of $0.334. Though the XLM/USD pair is showing signs of bottoming out, we suggest waiting for the pattern to complete with a breakout above the overhead resistance at $0.48. Such a breakout has a pattern target of about $0.8. If the bulls fail to push prices above the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency can enter into a range bound action for a few days. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the support line of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA today, but the bulls purchased the dip close to $150 levels and pushed prices back into the channel. Now, a rally above $168 levels will indicate strength and a move to the May 06 highs of $184.794 is possible. If the LTC/USD pair fails to scale the overhead resistance, it can decline to the next support level of $141.026. Presently, we don’t find a high probability trade setup, therefore, we are not recommending any fresh long positions. ADA/BTC Cardano broke below the support levels and declined to 0.00003301 levels where buying emerged. Our suggested stop loss is placed at 0.000029 levels, just below the lows of the handle, in the cup and handle formation. If the ADA/BTC pair fails to break out of the 0.00003445 levels quickly, it will continue to slide lower. It has already broken below the trendline and is just about hanging on to the horizontal support. Due to the weakness, we propose raising the stops on half position to 0.000032 and retaining the rest at 0.000029. IOTA/USD IOTA held the support line of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA on May 07. However, the resulting rally faced a stiff resistance at $2.55 levels. Currently, prices have again declined to the horizontal support at $2.2117. If this level holds, it will signal strength and we can expect a rally to the resistance line of the channel at $2.9. Traders can wait for a rally above $2.5 to sustain before entering long positions. If the IOTA/USD pair breaks down of the channel and the 20-day EMA, it will indicate weakness and the fall can extend to the next major support at $1.63. Right now, there are no reliable buy setups, hence, we have not suggested any specific buy and stop loss levels. EOS/USD EOS has largely been consolidating between $16 and $19.67 levels for the past few days. We like the way it has held above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from $5.9610 to $23.0290. This shows that the bulls are in no hurry to close their positions and are not waiting for a larger dip to buy. If the EOS/USD pair breaks out of $20 levels, the bulls will attempt to push it to new highs once again. On the other hand, a break below the $16 levels can sink the digital currency to $14.495 levels. We shall wait for the consolidation to end before suggesting any long positions.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The title of the conference was Phenomenon Bitcoin: Journey through the world of cryptocurrencies, which is Fenomén Bitcoin: Cesta Světem Kryptoměn in the Czech language.\nThe main aim of the conference was to introduce the audience to the world of cryptocurrencies. We started with basics and during the whole conference we kept up with even more interesting topics such as how to use a technical and fundamental analysis or how to accept Bitcoin or Litecoin in a store. The highlight of the conference was the amazing speech on blockchain-based social site STEEMIT which has grown into the debate where every attendee could ask any speaker about anything that interested them.\nFor this conference, we gathered the best speakers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and also reserved a very inspirative venue – ImpactHub Ostrava. Our organizing team was a bit nervous, but people were so happy with the atmosphere of the conference, so we were happy as well! Also, they liked our catering and the possibility to talk with top-class speakers in Ostrava, since the majority of the crypto events in Czech Republic are mostly held in main city Prague.\nI would like to thank our organizing team and all Students For Liberty for the given opportunity to make this beautiful event happen. During the event, we had a chance to meet new inspirating people and also get lots of new contacts in Ostrava, so that now we are ready to kick off with other projects in Ostrava! we are already planning the next event to happen in June devoted to the use of psychedelics in therapy, research and self-development!\nYou can read the rest of this article at: https://www.studentsforliberty.org/2018/05/09/phenomenon-bitcoin/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.studentsforliberty.org/2018/05/09/phenomenon-bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cesta světem kryptoměn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liberty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slovakia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T03:23:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a3079dd06ead215e30ed626c003ecf1e48416ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3x_6OPwwmXXxz9N60bzNMmfy5wArVjuR2JSU.7bNQXSU8MTjT_CL1imPoFvSU88fnA--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "New Movies Featuring Bitcoin Hitting Theaters Soon", "title_full": "New Movies Featuring Bitcoin Hitting Theaters Soon", "published": "2018-05-10T00:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a3079dd06ead215e30ed626c003ecf1e48416ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3x_6OPwwmXXxz9N60bzNMmfy5wArVjuR2JSU.7bNQXSU8MTjT_CL1imPoFvSU88fnA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T00:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Movies Featuring Bitcoin Hitting Theaters Soon", "text": "Home » bitcoin news » crypto coin » crypto news » New Movies Featuring Bitcoin Hitting Theaters Soon New Movies Featuring Bitcoin Hitting Theaters Soon bitcoin news , crypto coin , crypto news #bitcoin #news # invest #money\nSeveral films featuring Bitcoin are coming out before the summer. The main character in “Superfly”, a remake of the 1972 crime drama “Super Fly”, is now “swapping cash for crypto.” Director X’s debut movie is scheduled for release on July 15. And in Russia, two college students are chasing a hard disk storing a fortune in Bitcoin, after they sold the wrong PC to a pawn shop. The film should be ready by the end of May.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency Gets Its Own Comedy In “Bitcoin”– the Movie Superfly – Swapping Cash for Crypto, Redefining the Hustle\nHave you heard of the “Exploitation” genre, exploitation film or fiction? It was created by authors tempted to, well, exploit themes that some might consider taboo. Others won’t, but in any case, exploitation works are often pushing against the limits of “the appropriate” in their respective times.\nSex, drugs, and violence are all part of the “exploitation” intended to attract attention. It’s basically the pulp fiction of the second half of the 20th century. Blaxploitation is a subgenre, which for the first time placed African-American characters and communities in the spotlight. The 1972 crime drama “Super Fly” is a good example which has been recently remade.\nThe 2018 version exploits the usual taboos, but also a modern hot topic – digital cash and crime. “Superfly” is the debut movie of Director X, or Julien Christian Lutz, best known for the music videos he made for Drake, Jay-Z, and Rihanna. Sony Pictures just released a full-length trailer of his remake of the Blaxploitation classic.\nThe action now takes place not in Harlem, but in Atlanta. Actor Trevor Jackson plays the main character, a drug dealer who wants to quit the dirty business. In the meantime, the 21st century Youngblood Priest would rather be paid with… cryptocurrency. “I swapped cash for crypto, and redefined the hustle,” he says. We’ll see how successful “Superfly” will be in exploiting crypto, when the movie hits theaters mid-July. Chasing 6,000 Bitcoins on a PC Sold to a Pawn Shop\nWhile some heroes are making money, others are losing it. A movie whose storyline revolves around a bitcoin-related plot, is being shot in Russia. Two young guys from the city of Kazan are chasing a crypto fortune. While trying to trace and retrieve a hard disk with the keys to 6,000 bitcoins, the main characters – college students Igor and Artur – find themselves in a series of comic adventures but also life-threatening situations.\nThe boys may have lost the crypto cash forever, when they made the fateful mistake to sell the wrong PC to a pawn shop . 6,000 in Bitcoin is about $55 million in dollars and a staggering 3.5 billion in rubles. With big money comes big trouble and there is always someone willing to stand between you and that kind of money. The film should be ready by the end of May.\nBy the way, a movie theater in the Russian city of Yaroslavl is now accepting cryptocurrency. The “Neft” cinema club currently sells tickets for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold and Zclassic. “Bring your crypto wallets,” its founders tell their guests thanks to a partnership with the local Blockchain Institute. They had to solve a small problem in order to take advantage of the digital payments – cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in Russia.\nThe project has been officially announced as a marketing campaign tailored to attract crypto-savvy viewers. Tickets are free for those who want to “experiment” with digital transactions. Unable to defeat even “ Telegram ”, the state will eventually legalize cryptocurrencies, the organizers say. It’s Funny When They Feature Bitcoin\nA couple of comedies are also featuring Bitcoin. In an episode of HBO’s series Silicon Valley , one of the characters reveals to his colleagues that he mines the cryptocurrency. Gilfoyle, the systems architect of the Pied Piper startup, has created a price alert that blasts out the death metal song “You Suffer” by Napalm Death whenever the price of Bitcoin rises above or drops below a certain value, so that he can remotely toggle his rig at home to mine only when it’s efficient. Hilarious! Bitcoin can be very volatile, as Gilfoyle says.\nA comedy titled “Bitcoin” tells the story of a suburban father who, after losing his job, sets off with his deadbeat brother to convert an anonymous bitcoin account into the hard cash he needs to support his family. The two brothers from Arizona get their hands on a Bitcoin wallet worth $20 million and try to sell the crypto on the black market. “Bitcoin” is the debut feature of filmmaker Christian Cashmir. It’s produced by Lauren Cribb and starring TV comedian Theo Von. The shooting was expected to start by the end of April, in New Mexico. According to IMDb, the comedy is still in pre-production.\nDo you think movies featuring bitcoin popularize cryptocurrencies?

You know, his primary area of expertise. The weed, however, is taking a backseat today because Ricky using astrology to make major life decisions is so much more fascinating.\nSeriously. The former running back told CNBC he’s in the cryptocurrency game — specifically, Bitcoin — because of Uranus entering Taurus. We’ll allow him to explain the logic behind that ( via CNBC ):\nUranus, he explains, “is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation.” And Taurus “is about resources and finances,” says Williams.\nThe revolutionary aspect of Uranus in astrology, combined with Taurus’ focus on wealth and finance, is leading Williams to predict that, in the near future, “we’re going to totally change the way we view and understand” finances, he says.\n…\n“I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action,” Williams adds.\nThe report says Ricky dropped $50,000 on Bitcoin and isn’t bothered about the extreme nature of crypto. His reasoning? More talk about Uranus:\n“Especially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning,” he says. “But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.”\nBasically Ricky can afford to lose $50,000 if Bitcoin randomly drops to $0 and becomes worthless. Must be nice to have that NFL cash to fall back on. Rate this: Assistant Editor of Busted Coverage.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\n...\nXapo's billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who's in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\n...\nXapo's solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.... At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client's identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid hoffman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "linkedin corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:31:42.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "823808a1e9639be1ca50531a4d377d87736d8c48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWvqME8kL7agB5DE0__LPII-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "I did it!

The main character in “Superfly”, a remake of the 1972 crime drama “Super Fly”, is now “swapping cash for crypto.” Director X’s debut movie is scheduled for release on July 15. And in Russia, two college students are chasing a hard disk storing a fortune in Bitcoin, after they sold the wrong PC to a pawn shop. The film should be ready by the end of May.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency Gets Its Own Comedy In “Bitcoin”– the Movie Superfly – Swapping Cash for Crypto, Redefining the Hustle\nHave you heard of the “Exploitation” genre, exploitation film or fiction? It was created by authors tempted to, well, exploit themes that some might consider taboo. Others won’t, but in any case, exploitation works are often pushing against the limits of “the appropriate” in their respective times.\nSex, drugs, and violence are all part of the “exploitation” intended to attract attention. It’s basically the pulp fiction of the second half of the 20th century. Blaxploitation is a subgenre, which for the first time placed African-American characters and communities in the spotlight. The 1972 crime drama “Super Fly” is a good example which has been recently remade.\nThe 2018 version exploits the usual taboos, but also a modern hot topic – digital cash and crime. “Superfly” is the debut movie of Director X, or Julien Christian Lutz, best known for the music videos he made for Drake, Jay-Z, and Rihanna. Sony Pictures just released a full-length trailer of his remake of the Blaxploitation classic.\nThe action now takes place not in Harlem, but in Atlanta. Actor Trevor Jackson plays the main character, a drug dealer who wants to quit the dirty business. In the meantime, the 21st century Youngblood Priest would rather be paid with… cryptocurrency. “I swapped cash for crypto, and redefined the hustle,” he says. We’ll see how successful “Superfly” will be in exploiting crypto, when the movie hits theaters mid-July. Chasing 6,000 Bitcoins on a PC Sold to a Pawn Shop\nWhile some heroes are making money, others are losing it. A movie whose storyline revolves around a bitcoin-related plot, is being shot in Russia. Two young guys from the city of Kazan are chasing a crypto fortune. While trying to trace and retrieve a hard disk with the keys to 6,000 bitcoins, the main characters – college students Igor and Artur – find themselves in a series of comic adventures but also life-threatening situations.\nThe boys may have lost the crypto cash forever, when they made the fateful mistake to sell the wrong PC to a pawn shop . 6,000 in Bitcoin is about $55 million in dollars and a staggering 3.5 billion in rubles. With big money comes big trouble and there is always someone willing to stand between you and that kind of money. The film should be ready by the end of May.\nBy the way, a movie theater in the Russian city of Yaroslavl is now accepting cryptocurrency. The “Neft” cinema club currently sells tickets for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold and Zclassic. “Bring your crypto wallets,” its founders tell their guests thanks to a partnership with the local Blockchain Institute. They had to solve a small problem in order to take advantage of the digital payments – cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in Russia.\nThe project has been officially announced as a marketing campaign tailored to attract crypto-savvy viewers. Tickets are free for those who want to “experiment” with digital transactions. Unable to defeat even “ Telegram ”, the state will eventually legalize cryptocurrencies, the organizers say. It’s Funny When They Feature Bitcoin\nA couple of comedies are also featuring Bitcoin. In an episode of HBO’s series Silicon Valley , one of the characters reveals to his colleagues that he mines the cryptocurrency. Gilfoyle, the systems architect of the Pied Piper startup, has created a price alert that blasts out the death metal song “You Suffer” by Napalm Death whenever the price of Bitcoin rises above or drops below a certain value, so that he can remotely toggle his rig at home to mine only when it’s efficient. Hilarious! Bitcoin can be very volatile, as Gilfoyle says.\nA comedy titled “Bitcoin” tells the story of a suburban father who, after losing his job, sets off with his deadbeat brother to convert an anonymous bitcoin account into the hard cash he needs to support his family. The two brothers from Arizona get their hands on a Bitcoin wallet worth $20 million and try to sell the crypto on the black market. “Bitcoin” is the debut feature of filmmaker Christian Cashmir. It’s produced by Lauren Cribb and starring TV comedian Theo Von. The shooting was expected to start by the end of April, in New Mexico. According to IMDb, the comedy is still in pre-production.\nDo you think movies featuring bitcoin popularize cryptocurrencies?

Bitcoin is getting no love from two of the world's wealthiest men. \"I would short if if there was an easy way to do it,\" Bill Gates said Monday in an interview on CNBC. Gates said he had previously received some Bitcoin as a birthday present, but sold those a few years later. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are not the biggest bitcoin fans. Photo: Daniel Acker \"As an asset class, you're not producing anything.\" Fellow billionaire and Gates pal Warren Buffett said the largest cryptocurrency is \"probably rat poison squared\" at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. The comments may be weighing on Bitcoin's price as the digital asset slumps 4.2 per cent at 9:30 a.m. New York time to $US9,273, its first decline in four business days. Advertisement Loading Bitcoin climbed as much as 50 per cent since slumping near $US6,500 four weeks ago, but the rally has lost steam before crossing $US10,000. Speculation that US regulators are meeting today to discuss whether Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is a security, may also be limiting demand for cryptocurrencies.

from cryptocurrency businesses targeting residents in the state. The agency has most recently issued a pair of emergency orders against two separate entities that according to the regulators were scamming investors, including a bitcoin mining operation and a bitcoin foreign exchange investment fund. Both startups — Bitcoin Trading & Cloud Mining Ltd. (BTCRUSH) and Forex EA & Bitcoin Investment LLC — were promising outsized returns, among other alarming behaviors, and were issued cease and desist orders, bringing the tally of such requests issued by the Texas State Securities Board to nine. Joseph Rotunda, Director of the Enforcement Division at the Texas State Securities Board, told CCN that the latest emergency orders were part of a sweep that the agency launched at year-end 2017 when the bitcoin price was trading in the stratosphere. The sweep targets projects that raise red flags and that are promoting to Texas residents. The number of open investigations into cryptocurrency startups including ICOs has doubled since that time, from about 30 to approximately 60. We’ve seen this before when a new market emerges and people want to get rich quick at the expense of others. They infiltrate the market we are trying to weed out those folks. Their schemes are very fragile, like a house of cards waiting to tumble. Something comes along to offers that gust of wind and everything collapses,” Rotunda told CCN. In Texas, that gust of wind is increasingly taking the form of emergency cease-and-desist orders. Unrealistic Returns The two blockchain startups are accused of violating the Texas Securities Act for a lack of transparency in their management structure and investment philosophy in addition to not making plain the risks associated with cryptocurrency investing, not to mention attempting to lure investors with the promise of unrealistic returns. BTCRUSH is a UK-based cloud-fueled bitcoin and altcoin mining startup. It created a video that was supposedly comprised of the interiors and exteriors of a trio of mining facilities, Rotunda explained. The Texas securities agency was able to quickly decipher that the video was actually stock footage from the internet that was spliced. That led the regulators to realize that the company was not in compliance and to issue the emergency order. Rotunda told CCN: They weren’t just putting out a website and letting investors come to them. They weren’t just discussing investments on a message board. Their sales agents were specifically advertising and sending materials to Texas residents. They were communicating, ‘come to our website, register an account, purchase an investment. According to the cease and desist order, BTCRUSH, which only became operational in March, says it’s been distributing “4.1% daily interest on a lifetime contract and they offer a “100% satisfaction guarantee” along with the freedom to change the interest terms at will. The investment schemes offered heightened, unrealistic returns. New York-based Forex EA & Bitcoin Investment may not be based in the Lone Star State, but it was marketing its business to Texas residents. They allegedly used a Houston area code attached to their phone number even though the company isn’t physically located in the region, which would deceive unsuspecting residents. According to the emergency order, My Forex Bitcoin Investment claims to run a $500,000 fund that’s “climbing”. The startup is allegedly guaranteeing that a $5,000 investment will generate returns of $50,000 in about three weeks and any losses will be offset by the growing portfolio. But they fail to disclose their investment strategy to deliver these outsized returns and made no mention of any investment risks associated with investing in digital currencies, the emergency order alleges. Texas Prison Non-compliance with the cease and desist orders could result in up to a decade in a Texas prison. “What I found in my experience is once we enter these emergency actions, it shakes things up. Companies collapse sometimes. Once word reaches the public, that’s when the complaints come pouring in,” Rotunda said. Cryptocurrency-related investigations are taking more of the agency’s time of late, but not every situation ends with an emergency order. In some cases, the Texas securities regulator is able to communicate with the entrepreneur behind a blockchain-based startup and explain that they’re not doing things in accordance with securities law, after which time many individuals cooperate. As for the Texas Securities Board, Rotunda said they remain objective about the market. “We want to foster business. And my concern is people will be turned off to cryptocurrencies when there’s so much fraud out there. If we can get the bad actors out, the legitimate businesses can prosper,” he said.

in its network of vaults, unnamed sources have told Bloomberg.\nBitcoin storage provider Xapo now holds about 7% of the world’s total Bitcoin supply in its vaults, “roughly” amounting to $10 bln, Bloomberg reports May 9 quoting unnamed sources.\nAccording to two clients, the wallet and cold storage provider currently looks after an estimated $10 bln in the cryptocurrency.\nA further source “close to” the vaults, which now encompass five continents, called the figure an “accurate approximation.”\nXapo has only been on the market since 2014, making headlines when it converted a Swiss bunker to a Bitcoin storage facility late last year. Prior to that, the startup had struggled to achieve validity during a move to the country from the US which proved troublesome with regulators.\nConversely, cryptocurrency funds now praise the storage concept, despite the arguable lack of complete control and more centralized setup it represents when compared to individual cold storage options such as hardware wallets.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” UK-based investment platform CoinShares’ CEO Ryan Radloff told Bloomberg. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nThis overwhelming demand for cold storage of bitcoins places the company’s “deposits” above those of 98% of the US’ 5,670 banks, according to Bloomberg.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T02:24:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db51c7067ba141cd9f08d055bb846605c0cd9825", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQJWq8kQQF9M7fHrQscOJMM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN][Main] Bitcore- BTX - SEGWIT - hybrid fork 1:0.5 of Bitcoin", "title_full": "[ANN][Main] Bitcore- BTX - SEGWIT - hybrid fork 1:0.5 of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-09T22:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db51c7067ba141cd9f08d055bb846605c0cd9825", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQJWq8kQQF9M7fHrQscOJMM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jackbox", "published": "2018-05-09T22:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN][Main] Bitcore- BTX - SEGWIT - hybrid fork 1:0.5 of Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: Estrange18 on May 09, 2018, 01:48:13 PM Hi guys ! does this new wallet mandatory upgrade ?

It’s the only way this is going to work. Shortly after his marijuana-themed Super Bowl party , former NFL great Ricky Williams had a reckoning of sorts. It had to include some high-grade wacky tobacky and an astrologist.\nThere’s no telling if this is how it went down, but we’re here for suggestions.\nEither way, Williams — known to be a bit of an odd duckling — just recently indicated that he’s studying astrology. Not only that, astrology itself told Mr. Williams to invest in Bitcoin.\nThis is a real story. In 2018. And it’s spectacular.\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” Williams told the financial outlet . “The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus,” Williams told CNBC .”\nGiggles uncontrollably while inserting Uranus joke.\nThough, this definitely begs one major question. Why did it take astrology to get Williams to invest in Bitcoin? Dude is a little late to the game. Cryptocurrency has been a thing for a while. Then again, he smokes marijuana. Those type of people usually aren’t on the up-and-up when it comes to the latest trends.

This system was called bitcoin . Advertisement - Continue reading below\nSince then, bitcoin has made a name for itself in the world of technology and business, and it’s been called the “future of money” on more than one occasion. Nowadays, more and more people are using it to shop for various goods and services, and there is a large number of digital currency exchanges out there where you can easily buy and sell your bitcoin.\nIf you’re not really familiar with bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, you might be wondering: how did this system become so popular in the last couple of years? What is its secret? Well, bitcoin offers a couple of great advantages in contrast to the traditional cash system, one of them being decentralization (no need for intermediaries) which we mentioned above. Also Read: Power of Positive Thinking\nAnother lies in the fact that it operates on peer-to-peer technology called blockchain, which makes all transactions incredibly secure. The gist of it is this: if you want to buy something, all other members in the bitcoin network need to verify your transaction first in order for it to be approved. That way, the system avoids fraud, double-spending, and any possible misuse.\nLast but not least: bitcoin is stored in digital wallets, which basically function like locks. Each wallet comes with a public and private key – the former represents your address in the wide bitcoin network, while the latter unlocks your funds, which means that you’re the only one who can access them.\nOf course, there are plenty of more reasons why this revolutionary cash system has become a favorite in the world of tech, so if you want to learn more about bitcoin, its history, and fun facts, make sure to take a look at our infographic. You’ll have the bitcoin basics down in no time.

The firm has said that expects year-over-year gross revenue to jump by more than 700 percent to 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion) in 2018.\nMost of that remaining market share belongs to Bitmain, who also produces mining rigs for a variety of other mining algorithms, including those used by ethereum, litecoin, and most other major Proof-of-Work (PoW) altcoins.\nAs CCN reported, Bitmain is said to have raked in as much as $4 billion in operating profit last year, ranking it favorably with chipmaking giant Nvidia — a firm that is currently valued at $153 billion.\nDespite these astronomical profits, the secretive firm often manages to fly under the radar, and founder Jihan Wu was not even named in the inaugural Forbes Crypto Rich List.\nIn March, reports emerged that Bitmain was starting a US mining operation through Washington-based subsidiary Ant Creek, and the firm has also revealed plans to expand into other regions including Canada and Switzerland.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan cre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kong jianping", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sehk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china morning post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T02:24:21.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e07497f593ba133de4c8a6d5a310693cc8c3a248", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR18_2I1r9Mb37TFMfz1K5serXXIZSOKtD_Alxr66j35pt7BuR2I3wEBmchkbgJhflFQznqv12OjNYaUaVvSfXzLlilR35ahg1LtTPtMwXD1jM_WPUsf5yG", "site_full": "toddakiramorikawa.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://toddakiramorikawa.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Akira Morikawa", "title": "The Wealthy Are Hoarding $10 Billion of Bitcoin in Bunkers", "title_full": "The Wealthy Are Hoarding $10 Billion of Bitcoin in Bunkers", "published": "2018-05-09T21:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e07497f593ba133de4c8a6d5a310693cc8c3a248", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR18_2I1r9Mb37TFMfz1K5serXXIZSOKtD_Alxr66j35pt7BuR2I3wEBmchkbgJhflFQznqv12OjNYaUaVvSfXzLlilR35ahg1LtTPtMwXD1jM_WPUsf5yG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Todd Akira Morikawa (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-09T21:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Wealthy Are Hoarding $10 Billion of Bitcoin in Bunkers", "text": "The Wealthy Are Hoarding $10 Billion of Bitcoin in Bunkers\nvia Tumblr http://bit.ly/2rwjaS4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T03:00:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de63d4c0a6c8b10d9c13d09a4af49c782db1c4f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmatYXPB4EynScnDynWxLttA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "what's dragging the bitcoin price down?", "title_full": "what's dragging the bitcoin price down?", "published": "2018-05-09T21:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.936, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de63d4c0a6c8b10d9c13d09a4af49c782db1c4f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmatYXPB4EynScnDynWxLttA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CryptoKing1992", "published": "2018-05-09T21:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "what's dragging the bitcoin price down?", "text": "Warren Buffett and Bill Gates , both billionaires' view of cryptocurrencies has an impact on retail investors.

( FB ) executive and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya came to bitcoin ’s defense after scathing criticism for the cryptocurrency by legendary investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) founder Bill Gates earlier this week. In a CNBC interview, Palihapitiya likened bitcoin to buying insurance against a financial crisis similar to the one that plagued markets in 2007. “It is a non- correlated hedge [to the stock market],” he said.\nMonday’s tirade against bitcoin by Buffett and Gates had halted its march toward $10,000 and resulted in a significant drop in its price. But a slew of positive news, including announcement of a new crypto index and Palihapitiya’s vote of confidence, this morning helped it regain some lost ground. At 17:04 UTC, the cryptocurrency was trading at $9,275.62, up 1.6% from its price 24 hours ago. That figure also represents a climb of roughly 3% for bitcoin’s price from this morning. A Case of Circle of Competence\nDuring his conversation, Palihapitiya cited Buffett’s theory of sticking to one’s “circle of competence” as a possible reason that the legendary investor himself might be wrong. “It’s been clear in his entire investing career that technology is not in his circle of competence,” he said, referencing Buffett’s earlier investment in International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ), a stock which reported 22 quarters of losses before returning to growth earlier this year.\nSocial Capital, the venture capital firm co-founded by Palihapitiya, is based in Silicon Valley , a hotbed for innovation in cryptocurrencies. According to him, a “passport” is required to navigate the divergence in thinking about cryptocurrencies between regular investors and bitcoin believers. “These are not the same people,” he said. Detailing strategy for his own portfolio, Palihapitiya said he was 99% risk on and 1% risk off. “In that 1% risk off bucket, bitcoin is really important because it is not correlated to the rest of the market,” he said.\nDuring the cryptocurrency’s spectacular run-up in December last year, Palihapitiya had predicted a $100,000 target for the cryptocurrency within the “next three to four years” and a $1 million price target for it in the next 20 years. He revealed that his average purchase price for bitcoin was $100 and claimed to have held 5% of all bitcoin in existence at one point in 2013.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

And his analogy to illustrate this point was looking at the growth of the tech sector from the early 1980s through today.\nBack in late 1970s before personal computers became ubiquitous, there was serious doubt (even within the industry) that consumers would ever adopt the technology.\nKen Olsen, founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, famously stated in 1977 that “there is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.”\nThat very year saw the introduction of the Apple II, Commodore PET, and Tandy TRS-80 personal computers, all of which proved extremely popular with consumers.\nBy 1982 the computer replaced “Man of the Year” by Time Magazine, and several dozen companies had jumped into the industry designing hardware and peripherals.\nTechnology stocks began to rise, and shares of companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard quickly doubled in the early 80s.\nBut at that point a bunch of investors and market analysts began musing that the technology trend had reached its peak.\nThey had no idea what miraculous advances were still to come, and instead viewed the entire sector as an expensive fad.\nShare prices languished for several years– IBM stock went nowhere from 1983 until 1986.\nBut then Microsoft went public in March of 1986. And suddenly the market realized there was a whole new component to technology: software.\nMicrosoft’s stock price exploded, doubling in its first twelve months, and increasing 10x in four years.\nBut by the early 1990s the tech boom had once again run out of steam. Investors thought that the big software trend was totally overdone and that there really wasn’t much room for the tech sector to keep growing.\nShare prices languished again, as the market had no idea what was coming next.\nThen, in the mid 1990s, people caught wind of this thing called the “Internet”, which back then they referred to as the “Information Superhighway”.\nPeople realized there was yet another component to the tech boom. And so the investment bonanza continued.\nThis cycle has repeated itself again and again… with mobile, social media, e-commerce, etc.\nAll along the way, investors occasionally went through periods believing that technology had nowhere else to grow… or that it was all just a fad. They never had a clue what was coming next.\nThis is a pretty reasonable comparison to cryptocurrency.\nIt’s similar to the early 1980s when people thought that these technologies were just silly fads… or that the tech stocks were already expensive and they had missed the opportunity to invest.\nA lot of folks probably felt that way about Microsoft stock in 1990, after it had increased 10x from its IPO price four years earlier: “I missed it, the opportunity is gone.”\nMicrosoft’s share price, of course, would grow by another 10x before the end of the decade. And it’s up 100x through today.\nPeople are saying the same thing about crypto. It’s either too expensive to buy (“I missed it”), or it’s some sort of passing fad that will eventually go away.\nMost likely neither one of those is true.\nNow, here’s where I started to strongly disagree with this past weekend’s speaker.\nAt the end of his remarks, he told the audience unequivocally that “Bitcoin will go to $40,000 this year.” (And some attendees in the room actually bought Bitcoin based solely on this statement…)\nCertainly there’s some data to support the assertion. Various cryptofinance companies are working on ways to open up more investment in the sector to large banks and institutions.\nRight now, crypto is dominated by small investors. If you want to by $1,000, or even $1 million, worth of crypto, you can.\nBut if you’re a large fund with $50 billion under management, and you want to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, it’s REALLY difficult.\nThe infrastructure doesn’t exist. Not yet. But they’re working on it.\nThe banks and funds themselves are designing their own platforms to trade crypto, and even NASDAQ is getting in on the game.\nOnce they succeed, there could be a flood of institutional capital into cryptocurrency. Bitcoin could certainly benefit. Or perhaps it won’t.\nRemember the old quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.”\nBottom line– you have to be able to understand both sides. There are ALWAYS risks.\nSpecific to Bitcoin, for example, a truly honest assessment of the core software may lead to the conclusion that it’s technologically inferior to newer tokens and coins.\nIt’s also possible that large investors may bypass Bitcoin altogether and buy newer generation tokens.\nNo one has a crystal ball, especially in crypto. And it’s inappropriate to make blanket assertions that the price will reach X by date Y.\nUnderstand the obvious big picture trend. But also understand the risks. Then, based on the balance of the two, and a long-term view, make a RATIONAL decision to invest.\nIf you are interested in speculating in Cryptocurrencies, I encourage you to download our free Crypto Currency Report – A Different Perspective on Crypto .

A decommissioned Swiss bunker, like those where Xapo houses its vaults. Getty Images FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Bitcoin is a digital currency, but it still has a physical presence. Private, cryptographic keys need to exists as ones and zeros on actually computer memory. So what do you do if you're a newly-minted Bitcoin billionaire? Maybe you store those crucial codes in a Swiss bunker. As reported by Bloomberg , bunkers run by a startup known as Xapo, are filled with computer servers that are entirely disconnected from the internet and any other sort of computer network. The company does not actually store Bitcoin, which exists on the public, distributed ledger known as the blockchain . Rather, the vaults store the private, cryptographic keys used to lay claim to particular Bitcoins. Xapo has vaults on five continents, including ones embedded deep within the Swiss mountains. Last year, Quartz got an inside look at one of them. Xapo's head of security, Carlos Rienzi, described the situation as being \"under attack 24/7. This is not a race. It is a chess game. You have to think about the opponent’s next movement. You can never relax.” Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Citing two clients, Bloomberg estimates that Xapo keeps the keys to around $10 billion worth of Bitcoin in its various vaults, subject to Bitcoin's rapidly changing values. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general have proven to be pretty disruptive technologies in a very literal sense. The electricity-heavy mining process has gotten kicked out of small towns , sent Russian nuclear scientists to jail , and pissed off UFO hunters . But some things, like burying precious things deep underground, will never change.

No-one cares as usual. I keep looking at the stupidest news pumping other coins 10-20% a day and, hmmm. Is that the crowd ignorance or a genius touch, I do not know. I personally a long time hodler, dump if you dare.\ndump the kmd and buy the coins witch promise atomicswap and dex and bla bla in Q3 Q4!! you will get more ... fure sure!!!! ===> bad ideea\nplease stop think for short time... every project want to creat an dex with atomicswap ... but only komodo platform have it working right now , right here .\n@ komodo team , is time to push the marketing, because to many project like the ideea but only komodo platform can deliver . spread the word and tell how to use dex,atomicswap and dICO.\n[/color]\nIt def feels as though komodo is swimming in a sea of me too. We have alot of duplication in the crypto world right now. Platforms devoted to smart contracts, platforms devoted to different chain relationships, platforms devoted to speed, platforms devoted to Ico, etc.\nMany of these it appears have gotten some type of venture capitalist money and market themselves accordingly to the traditional venues, such as forbes, business insider, bank capital company this or that.\nEth has Vitalik, he already had a news platform and spoke in smart sounding buzzwords, then did speech after speech around the world. Add in his multimillionaire family and some goldmansaches stooges and you have institutional pumping of this product.\nJust go down the list of projects that are hyped with big valuations and youll see a alot of wallstreet style money making big claims vs grassroots crypto ingenuity. If that is the difference, then the only way to compete nowadays might be to get some goldmansachs on board.\nIf komodo platform is like the swiss army knife of crypto in that it can do one of everything great, but the question becomes, how can it compete in a sea of the same thing when project xyz can just start up and say we are going to revolutionize crypto speed or ico or better whatever. It becomes information overload and then all of a sudden komodo is lost in a sea of me too as who has the time to research 60 plus blockchain projects.\nHype IS necessary. Hype through games, competition, prizes, community building exercises, beautiful girls, fancy cars, whatever. Vhs had more hype then beta, look how that turned out.\nPersonally, the single most important thing of komodo platform right now, in my opinion, is chips. I know its on the backburner no hype or updates page but man does it have the potential to be a rocketship and bring in many new people to crypto. Of course though, by the time it is ready, will 50 projects already be loudly advertising me too?\nI agree 100%\nI would like to add that I was following an exchange between kmd and a member on slack yesterday. Komodo, you should be ashamed of yourselves for the way you treated that person. I enjoyed what he said and for the first time saw somebody with common sense trying to get the Komodo team to think outside the box. But no, you had to flame him until he said enough and left. This makes me question why I should stay involved with komodo if this is how you treat people that bring a much different perspective to the table.\nI also liked what days was saying but there seemed to be some disagreement going on. things that happen in slack posted by community members are not any official KMD position. We dont censor people and with that policy at times some people will be rude to others. I can only hope that such rudeness is not happening in the future", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T12:28:57.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1711be71fcc19c39abf2ea0ea78e89e346dfc63b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZZmZEaplaPKtZ_hUOfmS7tIMi6KL8l6V5LiIsylCFhE2hpJZRxksQHDlGSJJTW2M3UVsvf9pQ7gWS5fkPOat3aghIlJCMx9Y8ixkuoegPJne2E9frBVdjWw3zoxdp6i7QgRqZ6z5mmLopXSgoUxR3.Q-", "site_full": "www.theglobeandmail.com", "site": "theglobeandmail.com", "site_section": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/globe-wealth/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Globe Wealth - The Globe and Mail", "title": "Bunkers for the wealthy are said to hoard $10-billion of bitcoin", "title_full": "Bunkers for the wealthy are said to hoard $10-billion of bitcoin - The Globe and Mail", "published": "2018-05-09T19:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.432, "main_image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/Gtyv8fJxB2sQ4TLhq4r1NW6Rymo=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XGA3CPRX2JKNXHZ6AMG4FNPDDA.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2729, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1711be71fcc19c39abf2ea0ea78e89e346dfc63b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZZmZEaplaPKtZ_hUOfmS7tIMi6KL8l6V5LiIsylCFhE2hpJZRxksQHDlGSJJTW2M3UVsvf9pQ7gWS5fkPOat3aghIlJCMx9Y8ixkuoegPJne2E9frBVdjWw3zoxdp6i7QgRqZ6z5mmLopXSgoUxR3.Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Metcalf", "published": "2018-05-09T19:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bunkers for the wealthy are said to hoard $10-billion of bitcoin", "text": "Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete sit the encrypted computer servers – connected to nothing – that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: How much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10-billion of bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colourful world of crypto the cache is remarkable – amounting to about 7 per cent of the global bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just four years old, has more “deposits” than 98 per cent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the United States. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Mr. Casares – a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in bitcoin – has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale Investments Inc. and CoinShares Group.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500-million of bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning bitcoin is to keep your private key secure – that’s the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defence.\nRetrieving bitcoin takes two days Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Mr. Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20-million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Mr. Casares persuaded him to buy his first bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transaction to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell bitcoin and created the first bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nMr. Casares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but has largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Mr. Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Mr. Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. chief executive officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital Inc., Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, based in Vancouver picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with president Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\n‘Tidal wave’ of money The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Mr. Najarian said.\nMr. Casares has made acceptance of bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529-million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43-million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Mr. Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to Digital Gold , a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\n‘High hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards bitcoin because of Mr. Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Mr. Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T06:19:39.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4aa8ca6dfca8e684b2b15c63058b58cac62ae28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIl6ffAJxV4yhjWDXe29GcrKKhDwgNSMD1zotqNwfGpnfSpgrlc9O5QCHACSNbLtFKUfK8R59MGDLZwZtejUKL1k-", "site_full": "www.thedailyeconomist.com", "site": "thedailyeconomist.com", "site_section": "https://www.thedailyeconomist.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "The Daily Economist", "title": "President Trump's former economic adviser predicts that a global cryptocurrency will one day emerge, but it won't be Bitcoin", "title_full": "President Trump's former economic adviser predicts that a global cryptocurrency will one day emerge, but it won't be Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-09T19:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4aa8ca6dfca8e684b2b15c63058b58cac62ae28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIl6ffAJxV4yhjWDXe29GcrKKhDwgNSMD1zotqNwfGpnfSpgrlc9O5QCHACSNbLtFKUfK8R59MGDLZwZtejUKL1k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kenneth Schortgen Jr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-09T19:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "President Trump's former economic adviser predicts that a global cryptocurrency will one day emerge, but it won't be Bitcoin", "text": "Former Goldman Sachs executive and economic adviser to President Donald Trump spoke on ABC's This Week over the weekend and gave his thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies in the financial system.\nCiting the potential and viability of the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Cohn believes that one day a global cryptocurrency will emerge, but that it will not be Bitcoin due to its current and ongoing limitations.\nThere is a pressing need for a global cryptocurrency – but it will not be bitcoin, according to a former advisor to Donald Trump.

The title of the conference was Phenomenon Bitcoin: Journey through the world of cryptocurrencies, which is Fenomén Bitcoin: Cesta Světem Kryptoměn in the Czech language.\nThe main aim of the conference was to introduce the audience to the world of cryptocurrencies. We started with basics and during the whole conference we kept up with even more interesting topics such as how to use a technical and fundamental analysis or how to accept Bitcoin or Litecoin in a store. The highlight of the conference was the amazing speech on blockchain-based social site STEEMIT which has grown into the debate where every attendee could ask any speaker about anything that interested them.\nFor this conference, we gathered the best speakers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and also reserved a very inspirative venue – ImpactHub Ostrava. Our organizing team was a bit nervous, but people were so happy with the atmosphere of the conference, so we were happy as well! Also, they liked our catering and the possibility to talk with top-class speakers in Ostrava, since the majority of the crypto events in Czech Republic are mostly held in main city Prague.\nI would like to thank our organizing team and all for the given opportunity to make this beautiful event happen. During the event, we had a chance to meet new inspirating people and also get lots of new contacts in Ostrava, so that now we are ready to kick off with other projects in Ostrava! we are already planning the next event to happen in June devoted to the use of psychedelics in therapy, research and self-development!

Bize düşen farkında olmak, öğrenmek, öğretmek\nDünya üzerinde insanlar iki yönde eğilim göstermekte. Gelenekçi ya da yenilikçi.. Gelenekçi tarafı ağır basanlar geçmişinde harika işler başarmış fakat şu anda masa üzerindeki bir bardak suyu almak için bile yardıma ihtiyacı olan yaşlı bir amca gibidirler. Gelenekçiler yeniliğe kapalıdır. Yenilikçiler de geleneğe çok bağlı kalmazlar. Mesela bir ingiliz, Amerika olabilmek için kimliğini,kıta dışında bırakabilir, kendine yeni bir milli marş ,yeni bir bayrak edinebilir ve bu feda ettiği geleneklerle dünyada süper güç olabilir. Yeni dünya düzeninde geleneklerini yeri geldiği vakit feda edebilenler dünyanın yeni hakimleri olmuşlardır. Biz ülke olarak,millet olarak geleneklerimize son derece bağlıyızdır. Son derece bağlı olmamız sebebiyle yenilikleri kaçırmışızdır. Yaşlı geçkin kişilerin teknoloji ile bağını incelerseniz bunu daha iyi anlayabilirsiniz. Yeniliğe kapalıdırlar.Öğrenmeye aç değillerdir. Dokunmatik telefon istemezler de tuşlu telefon isterler mesela. Bilgisayarın nasıl açılacağını bilmezler mesela. Ayıp mı bilmemek? Asla. Öğrenmemek ayıp, bilgiye,yeniliğe aç olmamak ayıp. Sizler geleneklerinizden vazgeçmeseniz de yeniliklere gözünüzü kapatmayın lütfen.
