Following approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Gemini will begin accepting deposits of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency o n Saturday, May 19 at 9:30am EDT.\nThe regulated exchange that serves its existing customers in 48 U.S. states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and the U.K. will then begin its first day of trading Zcash on May 22 at 9:30am EDT.\nIn addition to being approved to custody and trade Zcash the NYDFS has confirmed to Forbes that Gemini will also receive approvals for Bitcoin Cash, with a total market value of $25 billion and Litecoin, valued at $8.2 billion, though details about when these currencies might go live remain sparse.\nIn a letter from Cameron Winklevoss, the Gemini president explained that the addition of the new products was the result of working closely with the NYDFS.\nQuote: : : Our approval makes Gemini the first licensed Zcash exchange in the world. It also makes the NYSDFS the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise Zcash.\nLater in the letter, Winklevoss explained that part of the appeal of Zcash is a privacy-protecting feature that allows counterparties to engage in trade without knowing anything about each other. Called zk-snarks, the technology that can be added to any number of blockchains provides the same certainty of the bitcoin blockchain but doesn’t require that individuals using it know one another’s public addresses.

It was launched in 2015 in the United States by the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, and has now expanded its operations to Europe and Asia. (For more, see Winklevoss Interview: Bitcoin Payment System Worth $400 Billion .) They already offer Bitcoin and Ether Trading; commencing May 19, 2018, they are set to also offer trading in Zcash . Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are reportedly also expected to be approved. Zcash is considered a \"privacy coin\" and touts itself as \"the first open, permissionless cryptocurrency that can fully protect the privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography.\" What Is Gemini?\nCompeting directly against other leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase , Gemini allows its users to buy, sell, and store primary cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, and exchange them against one another and for fiat currencies. (See also, What Is Kraken? )\nThe Latin word \"Gemini\" stands for twins, and indicates duality. The Gemini platform is conceptualized to marry both forms of money – new-age cryptocurrencies and the old, existing fiat currencies – which are expected to be used interchangeably in the future with the growing adoption of virtual currencies.\nCrypto bulls the Winklevoss twins have thus far not received SEC approval for their bitcoin ETF, but they have managed to carve a niche for themselves in the cryptocurrency transactions space. (For more, see SEC Blocks Bitcoin ETFs Again; Rejected Winklevoss Bid In 2017 .)\nWorking on the core principles of security, liquidity , and trust, Gemini offers its retail and institutional customers a platform to buy, sell, and store two of the most popular digital currencies, bitcoin and ether, in a regulated and secure environment.\nThe Gemini marketplace offers trading between BTC/USD, ETC/USD, and ETF/BTC. Barring the advanced notified short-term maintenance windows, the exchange operates on a 24/7 basis. No Margin or Short Trading Allowed\nAll orders sent on Gemini have to be fully funded, as the exchange currently does not offer margin trading like that offered by competitor like Kraken. It also does not allow short trading.\nAlong with the standard market order that gets immediately filled at the best available market price at that particular instant, Gemini offers a variety of limit orders where a trader can choose to get his trade executed in a way that's best matched to his needs. They include the standard limit order, Immediate-or-Cancel ( IOC ), Maker-or-Cancel (MOC), and Auction-Only (AO) limit orders.\nAt present, purchases using a credit card, debit card, cash, or check are not available. A customer needs to link a bank account and initiate a wire transfer or an ACH deposit from a local U.S. or an international bank for trading requirements.\nOne can transfer bitcoin and ether tokens from his respective cryptocurrency wallet to his/her Gemini account, and vice-versa. To deposit the cryptocoins into their Gemini account, a customer needs to generate exclusive deposit addresses on the Gemini platform and then initiate the transfer from their wallet to the generated address. First-of-a-kind Custodian Service\nAlong with being a standard virtual currency exchange, Gemini also offers custodian services to its clients.\nIt was licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to hold a customer’s digital assets in trust on behalf of the customer. That is, your digital currency holdings are held to specified capital reserve requirements and banking compliance standards. Gemini is also obligated to maintain and fulfill required cybersecurity measures.\nGemini has a banking relationship with a New York State-chartered bank, where all customer funds are retained. Adherence to such requirements acts like a insurance of one’s funds and cryptocurrency holdings, and ensures that they are backed by adequate monetary reserves.\nWhile individual customers are given the default, zero-fee, depository account type, large institutional customers can opt for a segregated custody account type which offers an offline, secure, and auditable storage called Gemini’s proprietary Cold Storage system. The latter service is chargeable, and is ideal for institutional customers like mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and hedge funds. The Road So Far\nLaunched in January 2015, the exchange went live for customers in the United States in October 2015.\nBy June 2016, it started operations in Canada, enabling ETH/BTC trading for Canadian customers. Two weeks later, it opened its doors for U.K. customers, marking its entry in Europe.\nIn September 2016, Gemini introduced the first-ever daily bitcoin auction , a method popularly followed in all modern stock exchanges but was the first for a cryptocurrency exchange. Daily ether auctions were launched in July 2017.\nBetween October and November of 2016, Gemini further expanded to Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan to cater to the skyrocketing population of Asian cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\nIn December 2017, Gemini partnered with the CBOE which launched the first-ever cash-settled bitcoin futures contract whose prices are based on Gemini’s auction price for bitcoin, denominated in U.S. dollars. Recent Challenges\nAs with any standard marketplace or security exchange, Gemini has had its fair share of challenges along its two-year journey. Some were due to developments in the cryptocurrency world like hard forks and high price volatility , while others were due to Gemini’s infrastructure and platform performance.\nFollowing the Ethereum hard fork in July 2016, the exchange ran into issues and had to temporarily disable all ether deposits and withdrawals. (See also: An Introduction to Ethereum Classic .)\nPreventive measures were taken, but similar issues occurred during the bitcoin hard fork of bitcoin cash in August 2017. During the same month, Gemini’s production environment, which was set on Amazon Web Services (AWS), exceeded the allotted resource quota, and hit trading snags for many hours over a couple of days. The problem was resolved after Gemini opted for more web resources to address such issues.\nIn November 2017, due to an unprecedented increase in traffic amid surging bitcoin prices, customers lost access to Gemini’s Web and API interfaces for a number of hours.\nAnother issue erupted in December 2017, when Gemini had to extend its earlier announced maintenance window by several hours amid high volatility in bitcoin prices that shed $1,500 during the downtime, drawing customer ire. The Bottom Line\nWith the recent successful settlement of the first-ever Bitcoin Futures (January series) at a price of $10,900.00 as determined by Gemini’s 4 p.m. Eastern Time BTC/USD auction, Gemini continues to surge ahead in the cryptocurrency transaction marketplace.\nGemini’s current offerings allow only among bitcoin, ether and USD pairs, and with limited trading options without any short selling or margin trading. However, customers can look forward to a secure and regulated trading environment as the firm's operations and holdings adhere to necessary regulatory standards.\nGoing forward, Gemini may need to expand its product offerings and look for expansion options around the world as it competes against established players like Kraken and Coinbase.

By partnering with iExec, RSK pushes these capabilities further by allowing its decentralized applications to access on-demand and scalable cloud computing resources. Smart contracts are coming to Bitcoin The world of smart contracts has emerged in recent years and is disrupting how modern business and trade are conducted across the globe. These self-executing virtual agreements have been popularized by Ethereum, but developers quickly saw the potential to enable them on the most famous blockchain platform as well: Bitcoin. While the traditional purpose of Bitcoin is to establish itself as a payment alternative, the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to its ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability. RSK is therefore the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency, thanks to a 2-Way Peg system that ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). iExec’s smart contracts deployed on RSK Meanwhile, iExec is developing the first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network. This marketplace allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications. iExec’s technology relies on Ethereum smart contracts and allows the building of a virtual cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand. However, decentralized apps will ultimately rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains, which has led iExec to adopt a blockchain-agnostic stance. RSK will allow developers around the globe to create decentralized personal and corporate solutions that work in the safest and most popular blockchain protocol, with low transaction costs that fit an ample range of needs. For these reasons, iExec has successfully deployed its V1 smart contracts on RSK as well. This SDK allows developers to build applications that will benefit from scalable and free cloud computing capabilities. The next steps of the partnership On May 29, 2018, iExec will release its V2, the most-awaited component of iExec. This release consists of a decentralized marketplace for trading cloud resources, and marks the very beginning of the possibility of monetizing one’s cloud resources in a peer-to-peer market. Once V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. About RSK RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability. About iExec iExec aims to decentralize the cloud computing market by building the future of the Internet infrastructure. We are developing the first blockchain cloud computing platform, to support the most compute-intensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, big data, fintech, cryptography, or 3D rendering.

LLC bitcoin exchange , famously founded by entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to trade in the cryptocurrency Zcash.\nThis authorization makes Gemini the first regulated exchange in the world to accept the currency. The exchange will also be adding Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, two other popular cryptocurrencies, to its trading manifest with approval from NYDFS in the near future.\n“With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,” said Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo.\nGemini became a limited trust charter organization with the NYDFS during 2015 when it gained approval to exchange bitcoin for U.S. dollars. That followed the final draft of a regulatory policy by the NYDFS known as “ BitLicense ,” a framework which would pave the way for licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in the state.\nAs a cryptocurrency, Zcash was developed with privacy in mind by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Co., better known as Zcash Co. Two types of transactions are possible on the Zcash network: transparent and shielded. Both types are published on a public blockchain, the same type of underlying protocol that bitcoin uses.\nTransparent transactions operate similarly to bitcoin and any transaction made this way is publicly visible on the Zcash blockchain. Shielded transactions, however, use a system called z-addresses, which are entirely private. Through a specialized protocol that encrypts information related to z-address transactions, it’s possible for Zcash to acknowledge an exchange of Zcash tokens without revealing any information publicly about the sender-receiver pair or the amount exchanged.\nTyler Winklevoss, chief executive of Gemini, called Zcash “an incredible new form of digital cash.” He added that as the world’s first licensed exchange for this currency, he looks forward to “to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash.”\nAccording to CoinMarketCap , the total market capitalization for Zcash is around $1.2 billion with a daily volume of approximately $230 million. In comparison, bitcoin, Gemini’s current primary currency, holds a global market capitalization of approximately $150 billion and a daily trading volume in excess of $7.4 billion.\n“Zcash picks up where bitcoin left off,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “Bitcoin has many strengths, but privacy is not one of them.”\nIn a press release, Gemini announced that the exchange will begin accepting deposits for Zcash starting on Saturday.

All the cryptos have CRASHED. Good call!”\nI didn’t address the crypto situation much as it unfolded because I didn’t want readers mistakenly buying into the bubble. Now that the air has come out of the crypto-mania, I hope it’s safe to talk about the real opportunity.\nI’m not talking about bitcoin. I’m talking about the blockchain – and the dividend growth opportunities that will unfold as this “megatrend” plays out in the coming years and decades.\nThe blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, I’m going to introduce you to five pioneering income plays that boast a “blockchain kicker.”\nFirst, a quick primer on blockchain.\nThe simplest way to describe the technology is to call it a digital ledger of sorts. It’s essentially just a group of encrypted records (“blocks”) that can be used to record transactions and other interactions.\nThe utilization of blockchain that people are most familiar with are cryptocurrencies – products such as Bitcoin that are meant to serve as digital currencies, but have quickly become extremely speculative investments as they’ve gained thousands of percent in just a few years. But companies are increasingly learning that blockchain can be used for so much more, from tracing medical histories to keeping voting records.\nAs a result, companies from Amazon and International Business Machines to Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are becoming increasingly involved in trying to exploit this technology. That has given rise to a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on this space, including one that’s surprisingly rife with dividend growth names.\nThe Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF is a portfolio of companies expected to benefit from blockchain in some way, with the stocks actually graded by their “potential for increased economic profit, operational efficiencies, and transformational business practices.” In short, it holds “companies working to utilize and incorporate blockchain technologies into their businesses.”\nWhat fascinates me about this fund, however, is the dividend growth potential in some of its component stocks.\nReality Shares’ BLCN is a deviation from its main focus: income. The ETF provider boasts another quartet of funds, all of which hold dividend stocks, and three of which are centered around the company’s proprietary “DIVCON” system.\nThe DIVCON system essentially measures a stock’s dividend health, assigning a score of 1 to 5, “where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.”\nAnd right now, this system is flashing a ringing endorsement for five blockchain-linked stocks, which are all at “DIVCON 5.” In other words, they’re in the best position for dividend growth going forward:\nVisa\nDividend Yield: 0.6%\nBLCN Weight: 1.39%\nA stock like Visa that yields just 0.6% hardly screams “income opportunity,” but it is. Visa has juiced its payout by 154% in five years. But it’s not just a prolific dividend grower – it’s a perfect example of the share-price growth you should expect when a company puts its shareholders first via increasingly generous cash payments.\nVisa already is elbow-deep in blockchain. The company launched a pilot phase of a blockchain-based B2B payments service called B2B Connect last year in partnership with banks in the U.S., South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines. The service will allow institutions to make payments to one another directly, and the second phase of the project is expected to go live later this year.\nMasterCard\nDividend Yield: 0.5%\nBLCN Weight: 1.40%\nVisa rival MasterCard also has its hands in blockchain, making its moves through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In early April, the credit-card processing company filed a patent to help verify and store identity data on a blockchain system. Later in the month, it filed another patent, this time to create “fast track flags” within the blockchain that would allow nodes (any electronic device that performs a task within the blockchain network) to more quickly verify data, making the system work more efficiently.\nMasterCard might be an even more intriguing opportunity. While Visa’s share price and dividend growth have been roughly in line, MA shares – despite more than tripling over the past year – still haven’t caught up with the pace of the dividend, which has quadrupled and then some over the same time frame.\nTexas Instruments\nDividend Yield: 2.2%\nBLCN Weight: 2.04%\nTexas Instruments isn’t exactly known for being the flashiest of chip stocks. Its analog chips and embedded processors, which make up 80%-plus of revenues, are found in some of the simplest of devices, from calculators to alarm clocks. But they have a wide array of uses, from appliances to displays to motors drives and even avionics.\nThe company is increasingly delving into more cutting-edge technologies, however, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. And its position as a chipmaker also puts it square in the world of enabling the devices that make the blockchain possible.\nThat said, TXN’s positioning in the less glamorous world of analog chips makes it a cash cow with the few companies that even want to compete with it. And Texas Instruments makes good use of that cash, more than doubling its dividend over the past five years.\nIntuit\nDividend Yield: 0.8%\nBLCN Weight: 1.31%\nIf the blockchain acts as a ledger of sorts, what better company to research its applications than Intuit – the well-known purveyor of accounting software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks.\nIntuit clearly spells out the blockchain opportunity in a post about the technology’s potential:\n\"Some accounting and auditing firms already embrace blockchain technology. Blockchain transactions are simpler, more visible, and more transparent. Improvements in operational efficiency mean that much of the work accountants do, such as collecting and inputting data, sampling, and proving provenance, takes place automatically. This leaves accountants more time to provide valuable services to their clients.\"\nAgain, this is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years. And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well-armed enough to continue the upward march.\nNvidia\nDividend Yield: 0.3%\nBLCN Weight: 2.06%\nOne of BLCN’s most exciting holdings is also one of the “healthiest” from a dividend perspective.\nNvidia , maker of high-performance chips, is among the stocks most commonly connected with the booming blockchain technology. That’s because its GPUs are widely used by cryptocurrency “miners,” who need extremely powerful computers to do the processing necessary to generate new digital tokens.\nIn fact, demand is so intense that Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently said the company needs to crank out more of the GPUs to catch up, as video gamers (Nvidia’s bread-and-butter market) are finding it difficult to procure the graphics chips their advanced games require.\nThe sky seems the limit, then, for its blockchain potential, and the same goes for NVDA’s income opportunity. Because despite the fact Nvidia has powered up its dividend by 76% since 2014, it currently boasts a mere 11% payout ratio. That’s a large reason why Nvidia boasts DIVCON’s top score of dividend health, and why investors should be licking their chops over this dual-threat stock going forward.\nDisclosure: none", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:10:35.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85b2384ceae0ae130a665b8ebe62c31d16a3af1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseALaBymDkb_be_SZ4vJlP9xg0v7jXVMAxakgLBvcjSL_8VO800gaTSRZho5WjkhPOPW20rmrmDAasifvfr4silZJKl6DSMAIAjrexdXPCDKC7hdDr9md2KBQ--", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/markets/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes - Markets", "title": "5 Bitcoin-Powered Dividend Growers To Buy Now", "title_full": "5 Bitcoin-Powered Dividend Growers To Buy Now", "published": "2018-05-14T21:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fthumbnails%2Fblog_3961%2Fpt_3961_2205_o.jpg%3Ft%3D1526303164", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 50, "comments": 0, "shares": 50}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85b2384ceae0ae130a665b8ebe62c31d16a3af1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseALaBymDkb_be_SZ4vJlP9xg0v7jXVMAxakgLBvcjSL_8VO800gaTSRZho5WjkhPOPW20rmrmDAasifvfr4silZJKl6DSMAIAjrexdXPCDKC7hdDr9md2KBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brett Owens", "published": "2018-05-14T21:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 Bitcoin-Powered Dividend Growers To Buy Now", "text": "My college buddy AC wrote to me after the bitcoin bubble crashed: “You were very right!

The reason for this debate stems from the theory that such concurrent currencies would, through the market pressures of competition, lead to a more sound money system and more stable currencies in the long run. This advocate view is held most strongly by Austrian Economist Friedrich Hayek. The general argument states that since currencies would be allowed to compete, just as any other good, consumers would seek out the best investment; the one that is most stable and secure. This would encourage the backing of certain currencies with commodities to compete with fiat currencies (which the Austrian School believes are suspect to great inflationary pressures and political whims). Its opposition has most recently been led by the economist Milton Freedman. Freedman argues that the benefits of competing currencies would be less than expected, mainly because the process of establishing such a system would be inhibited by network effects and transition costs. Network effects refer to the theory that the value of money or a currency is partially derived from the number of other people holding that currency. Transition costs refer to the cost of both holding wealth in two different currencies and the costs associated with moving from one currency to another.\nThis has been proposed by many scholars and politicians before. Libertarian oriented individuals have suggested that allowing a commodity based currency to compete with the US dollar, and allowing the market to decide the value of the currencies would benefit stability. Recently, the first modern example of competing currencies took place in Somalia. After the collapse of Mohamed Siad Barre’s regime in the Democratic Republic of Somalia, the Central Bank of Solamia collapsed, bringing about a system of four operating currencies. These included the Na’Shilling, the Somaliland Shilling, the Balwayn I, and the Balweyn II. However, this situation did not end the way that advocates such as Hayek hoped. Though Somalia had many other social and economic issues that could have affected the concurrent system, it appeared that the network effects and transition costs that Friedman suggested had taken place. For instance the Na’Shelling circulated mainly within one clan and thus failed to gain significant usage by others in the country. This exhibited network effect limited ability to trade in the Na’ Shilling. In addition, even in the face of extreme depreciation, 67%, the Somali Shilling maintained its status as the dominant currency. This suggests that there were increasingly large psychological and economic transition effects. Similar effects were present in the other currencies.\nAs was shown in the Somalia example, it appears the Milton Freedman was correct in that transition costs and network effects inhibit the system of concurrent currencies from establishing and functioning correctly. However, my opinion is that this may soon change. The creation of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, eliminate many of the transition costs associated with concurrent systems as well as provide more of an opportunity for more wide spread usage.\nIn January of 2009 Bitcoin emerged as a new virtual currency. More correctly, it is defined as a cryptocurrency. The creation of the currency is the result of an open-source cryptographic protocol which is not linked to any central bank or government. Bitcoins are totally virtual (no tangible store of value) and can be transferred via computer or smartphone. They are essentially a new form of fiat currency. They act as any other means of exchange – you can exchange your Bitcoins for products, trade them like any other currency, and exchange them for other currencies in the market. This new cryptocurrency has many advantages such as its volume being capped at 21 million (to combat inflation). It is also produced using a stable algorithm which makes it impossible to create more money with little notice, which usually is thought to lead to instability in common currencies.\nIt is possible that this new cryptocurrency could solve or at least lessen the network effects and transition costs associated with concurrent currencies – making it a much more reasonable system within which to operate. Since Bitcoin, as well as other virtual currencies, can be obtained and stored via the internet, the cost of switching currencies is much less. No longer must an individual have to make their way to a currency exchange to make a physical transaction. Switching currencies becomes less costly also because you no longer have to pay the premium for a physical location and workers at such currency exchanges. Furthermore, since Bitcoin is centered on the internet, both buyers and sellers are less likely to suffer from the negative network effects present in other cases of concurrent currencies. This is because people from all over the world now have the ability to possess this currency. It is not limited to a certain geographic location. Such a spread in availability makes the currency more likely to be used and desired because the quantity of producers and consumers using the currency has increased.\nThough past examples have showed that concurrent currencies may only be desirable in an ideal world, it is possible that the emergence of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, which reduce network effects and transition cost, will change this. The next few years will serve as the time period for this great currency experiment, shedding light of the long going debate of whether or not it is likely that two currencies can effectively exist at one time, competing directly against one another. Lastly, as the global economy continues to see low growth and instability in the US Dollar and Euro, we may see virtual currencies take a strong foot hold as a major medium of exchange. This is not to say that virtual currencies will be a panacea for stability, only that their emergence is a great opportunity for us to try out a system of competing currencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "friedrich hayek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milton freedman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "austrian school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:04:34.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77096a247f44ace33f44ca373ae169a43a043810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFR7DPIBFa5pvVJ6Wi3FCHAgb7oD6jFeXD6wRb4Ufd.WuS1aovirzjUnd9ikq.5P9wIzJrc1mPp0Q8pu_b8WEyQ8DkTrESxKkW2zdBprK5_16_x2TFTb2Bis-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "A French Street Artist Made $1000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals", "title_full": "A French Street Artist Made $1000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals", "published": "2018-05-14T21:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2zLpsGvU.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77096a247f44ace33f44ca373ae169a43a043810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFR7DPIBFa5pvVJ6Wi3FCHAgb7oD6jFeXD6wRb4Ufd.WuS1aovirzjUnd9ikq.5P9wIzJrc1mPp0Q8pu_b8WEyQ8DkTrESxKkW2zdBprK5_16_x2TFTb2Bis-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-14T21:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "A French Street Artist Made $1000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals", "text": "A French Street Artist Made $1000 After Adding a Bitcoin QR Code to His Murals by 0\nSarah Cascone, May 14, 2018 Even if you don’t quite understand cryptocurrencies, you’ve probably heard that Bitcoin and its many siblings are the way of the future. Now, one artist has come up with a new way to benefit directly from this still-nascent technology by inviting passersby to donate to him using a Bitcoin QR code, which he affixed to his murals.\nThe brainchild behind the idea is French street artist Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, and the artist’s embrace of the digital currency is already paying dividends. As of this writing, Boyar has made 0.11 Bitcoin (about $1,000) from 23 donors thanks to his clever embrace of cryptocurrency.\nThe feat has even caught the attention of Reddit. Boyart was intrigued by the idea of being able to connect directly with the public and to receive money for his work without going through a middleman.\nSo, he took six months off from painting to learn about this new technology. The donation process that resulted is decidedly simple: Anyone with a smartphone and a Bitcoin wallet can scan the QR code on the mural and make a digital payment that goes directly to the artist.\n“I think that the times we are living are difficult for free-minded artists,” the artist told artnet News in an email. “It looks like the Impressionist era, with an official art of academic artists and the others that you have not much chance to see in an international art fair.” Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, Rembrandt dos au mur, a mural in Paris featuring a QR code that allows the public to donate to the artist using Bitcoin.

Most are still reluctant to support the view that bitcoin and other digital assets belong in investment portfolios. Citing concerns over liquidity, price volatility and regulatory issues, by and large, they seem to agree that bitcoin in asset allocation falls in the “not yet” category .\nMeanwhile, on the product side, the Winklevoss twins acquired a patent for cryptocurrency ETFs. It’s still unclear what this patent means to issuers looking for ways to bring to market bitcoin ETFs, but it adds another wrinkle to the ongoing conversation about bitcoin’s role in the world of investing.\nSmart Beta vs Factor ETFs\nTo many, smart beta and factor ETFs are one and the same. But that’s an assumption that could actually be costing investors, say experts.\nPut simply, smart beta and factors come from very different roots, and according to Research Affiliates’ Rob Arnott, “ because factor investing begins by using a market-capitalization weight and then adds a factor tilt, it isn’t smart beta.”\nSome say the term “smart beta” has gotten “stretched” beyond its original purpose; the same can be said about factor investing if you go back to the original Fama-French research.\nFor quick reference, check out ETF.com’s latest article on the topic , outlining these broad characteristics of each:\nWhat Is Smart Beta?\nSmart beta ranks companies by their size rather than by their market capitalization When creating an index, the company’s size is used as an anchor to determine its weighting; that weighting is rebalanced if prices move extravagantly If a company’s price is soaring but the fundamentals of the company have changed, the index will trim the position; if the prices fall and the fundamentals haven’t changed, the index buys the stock. Takes into account alternative ways to measure worth, e.g., volume, liquidity, momentum Sometimes called equal weight, fundamental weight, alternative beta No single approach Usually long only What Are Factors?\nAn asset pricing model created by University of Chicago professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French (now at Dartmouth) Fama and French found 5 main factors are associated with higher returns: value stocks, size momentum, low volatility and quality (also known as dividend payers); A 6th factor, yield, is sometimes included in the main factor definition count Different factors work during different times in the market cycle, but they can’t be timed Usually a long/short strategy Usually market-cap weighted, but can be used with fundamental weighting Nontraditional factors such as share buybacks, and environmental, social and governance tilts are becoming more popular as factor investing grows in use.

The bloc agreed on Monday to force cryptocurrency exchanges to identify users. That will make it harder for criminals to use virtual cash to hide their ill-gotten gains.\nThe EU's bitcoin assault is part of a broader attack on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. To do so, the bloc is updating the existing anti-money laundering directive to shed light on opaque areas of the financial world. One key novelty is a requirement for the dozens of European exchanges which trade in currencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, and the technology companies that store the money in so-called wallets, to carry out the same know-your-customer checks as ordinary banks.\nThe European transparency push could help change things. If transactions are no longer secret, this should deter usage for illicit means, and facilitate the work of law-enforcement agencies. It may also make it harder for criminals to hack exchanges, as happened with Slovenian group NiceHash last year.\nCriminals can still use exchanges outside the EU. There's also a danger that more trading simply moves off exchanges. But Europe is not alone in the fight. South Korea imposed similar rules earlier this year, and the United States may not be far behind. If more trading happens out of the shadows, virtual currencies could become more respectable.\nOn Twitter\nCONTEXT NEWS\n- The European Council, which represents EU national governments, on May 14 approved stricter rules to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The rules include provisions to make it harder for users of virtual currencies such as bitcoin to remain anonymous.\n- Under the new rules, which EU member states will have to transpose in national legislation, providers of cryptocurrency exchange platforms and custodians of wallets that can hold virtual money will have to verify the identity of users.\n- The Financial Action Task Force, a global anti-money laundering body, has expressed concern about the use of virtual currencies as a means of financing terrorism and Islamic radicalisation.\n- The market for virtual currencies reached a peak of $432 billion earlier this year, Reuters reported on May 14, citing European Central Bank governing council member Yves Mersch.\nEU Council press release\nAmendments to EU anti-money laundering directive (graphic) .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://api.trkd.thomsonreuters.com/api/topnews/topnews-images/2018-05-04T065814Z_1421941598_RC1E19D30B80_RTRMADP_2_CRYPTO-CURRENCIES-INDIA.JPG.ashx", "http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/05/14/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-new-rules-adopted/", "http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-72-2017-INIT/en/pdf", "https://twitter.com/LJucca"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisa jucca", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters breakingviews", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:49:32.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5efa162cf5898f67bd27a288e3148922ee7647a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8bUGUcazfyNBhaE0qreXSF4lcDid3PdhJCKhPpmpDXmTEAwwb4..jVRSy2zwhIansA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Is Bitcoin cash legal and halal?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin cash legal and halal? : btc", "published": "2018-05-14T20:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.31, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5efa162cf5898f67bd27a288e3148922ee7647a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8bUGUcazfyNBhaE0qreXSF4lcDid3PdhJCKhPpmpDXmTEAwwb4..jVRSy2zwhIansA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "redditLibertariansuk", "published": "2018-05-14T20:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin cash legal and halal?", "text": "submitted by /u/redditLibertariansuk\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:09:01.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3780a8be6070b29f2348cb611af6b8d6a06f9a25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb45RQr7LWKpC4RIZfOiMDrredonC2.NtcRjZ4LwGGAZEL5WNVo038oew--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin News Portal CoinIdol.com Announces Its Expert Members Club", "title_full": "Bitcoin News Portal CoinIdol.com Announces Its Expert Members Club", "published": "2018-05-14T20:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3780a8be6070b29f2348cb611af6b8d6a06f9a25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb45RQr7LWKpC4RIZfOiMDrredonC2.NtcRjZ4LwGGAZEL5WNVo038oew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T20:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin News Portal CoinIdol.com Announces Its Expert Members Club", "text": "Bitcoin News Portal CoinIdol.com Announces Its Expert Members Club\nTom Clancy\nThis is a submitted sponsored story.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\nThe state’s Department of Financial Services said it also approved Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the future.\nZcash’s market value was roughly $1.3 billion on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap.com, while Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin’s respective values were $25 billion and $8.3 billion. Bitcoin’s market value was about $150.1 billion.\n“With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,” Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.\nLast month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures.\nZcash incorporates the technology “zk-snark,” short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity.\nGemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.\n“We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,” Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo’s office.\nThe Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website.\nThey also competed in the men’s rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis Share Or Comment On This Article Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Capitalbay.

In such a case, bitcoin risks falling below $8,000.\nView BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and could then drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).\nBullish scenario : Another rebound from $8,207 and a break above $8,760 would open doors for a move back above $9,000. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $9,038 would confirm the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.\nBitcoin and U.S. dollars Â image via He Paid How Much?!

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below.\nThe Bitcoin economy has not only boosted the fintech sector but it has also allowed room for bloggers, social media personalities and newsrooms to flourish. There are many top-of-the-line cryptocurrency news outlets that are useful for traders, investors and general crypto enthusiasts for analyzing the future of the decentralized space.\nCoinIdol.com is one of the top crypto blogs in the world with over 250,000 views per month . The magazine mostly deals with fintech, Bitcoin and blockchain news, and has recently announced the opening of its exclusive members club for crypto enthusiasts and experts around the world. The Industry Red Carpet\nWith Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, it is usually the top voices that seem to matter in the magazines and smaller, possibly more promising voices are often ignored. Coinidol.com is offering a rare opportunity for everyone involved in the cryptocurrency space to become a well-known source in the crypto circles like the ones we like to hear from week in week out.\nThe members club is going to be like a competition of minds and ideas in the crypto space. Just being in the club doesn’t qualify one of being a crypto expert. All the contributions from the members are scrutinized by the Coinidol team and they approve only the best of the best among them. There is also a strict code of ethics that members have to adhere to in there contributions and promotional wording, etc will be subject to censorship and membership possibly canceled.\nCoinidol CEO George So had this to say over the argument between trust and money:\n“We keep our ethics. That’s why we do not change anything in our official editorial policy. We refuse publication of any advertising inside editorial articles. If you want to publish any advertising, the only way to do that is to order an official sponsored article, marked with the disclaimer “paid advertising”. Members’ Club Exclusive Privileges\nWhile becoming a member of the Coinidol.com experts members club requires a small payment that is one-time, by no means the club is restricted to just people who are ready to dole out some money to be recognized in the cryptocurrency space. To fight scammers and promoters and to keep the quality of the material top notch, all applicants will have to chat with the editorial team and tell them what proves them to be a valuable addition to the club and what they will bring to the table.

May 14th, 2018 Karmen Wielunski, DO Karmen Wielunski, DO, is a 2017-18 Chief Resident in Internal Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, WI What’s the big deal about Bitcoin and digital currency? For the past year, my husband (who has a business background) has been enthusiastically researching digital currency. Thus, the terms Bitcoin (BTC) and MaidSafeCoin (MAID) have become commonplace in my household for some time. But, to be honest, I hadn’t been paying much attention to any of it until recently. Don’t get me wrong — it’s not that I don’t listen when my husband talks. Rather, my medically trained mind tends to wander due to an inaptitude for many business and technological concepts. With all the Bitcoin buzz and a New Year’s resolution to be more up to date on current events, I attempted to become informed. I asked my husband to, once again, break down this whole digital currency thing for me. About 2 minutes into his explanation (I’m sure he could see my mind wandering), he paused and said, “You know what, why don’t I just show you how it works.” And, with that, I was buying (a fraction of) a Bitcoin. I started by creating an account on Coinbase. This was easy and only required verification of my email address and phone number. I then linked it to my bank account. With a click of a button, I was the proud owner of 0.0021 Bitcoin (worth US$25). Actually, I had to wait a few days for the transaction to process, but it was less complicated than I imagined. By creating an account, I also acquired a public address that consists of a long string of numbers and letters (for example, mine is 166ZUjHuWRGBFm71irtEXLhJRKCv4JooqM). While I won’t be committing this to memory anytime soon, I learned that the public address allows for easy transfer of digital payments from one party to another. A Frightening Revelation With my newly acquired (though, admittedly still minimal) knowledge, I wondered how Bitcoin might affect healthcare. It only took about 30 seconds of internet research to realize that Bitcoin and digital currency are already very much affecting healthcare. I read an article that detailed a cyberattack on the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS). During the attack, hackers created an electronic lockdown that affected the NHS and then demanded a Bitcoin ransom to release it ( N Engl J Med 2017; 377: 409 ). Another article detailed a very recent cyberattack on a hospital in Indiana that targeted more than 1400 files. The hospital paid 4 Bitcoins (about $47,000) to hackers to regain access to their files ( Health IT News 2018 Jan 16; [e-pub] ). The reports of these attacks went on and on — institutions in Texas, California, and Kentucky are all recent victims. Each story detailed some combination of patient record and computer access involvement, and many involved Bitcoin ransom requests. WHAT? This is a big deal! My simple quest to learn about a trendy form of currency led me to recognize a very serious threat to healthcare system security. As I continued to read through more accounts of recent cyberattacks, I felt embarrassed about my obliviousness up to this point. I worried about the seemingly routine nature of these attacks. Are we all just sitting ducks waiting for our healthcare information to be breached? Hope For The Future With a sense of urgency, I again consulted my husband. “Did you know this was happening?” I asked. He was excited about my continued interest in the topic and began catching me up. It turns out other people are (understandably!) worried about this, too. Many companies are attempting to create programs using Blockchain — the technology upon which Bitcoin is based — to improve data security. One company called MaidSafe, he explained, is taking an entirely different and exciting approach to solving this problem. They are currently developing a new technology using datachains to create a SAFEnetwork which is, essentially, a decentralized, anonymous internet. The network data is encrypted, broken into pieces, and stored across many locations, making it anonymous and secure beyond existing systems. The live version could possibly launch in 2018 and holds great promise for countless applications including the safe keeping of healthcare information. As previously noted, my knowledge of technology is limited at best, and I don’t claim to be an expert on this topic. The above explanations are likely drastically oversimplified, but I feel it is important to discuss the concepts and what is being done to combat this threat to healthcare security. In the meantime, I still feel like a sitting duck.

Quoting: Anonymous Coward 75509684 You honestly don't know how drug dealers do their job, huh?The first sample is ALWAYS free (that's why Silk Road was created).The second, was the run up to $18k as another psychological hook.They got everyone talking, looking into and converting to bitcoin and Crypto now.Where debit, credit cards and online banking and Internet purchasing wasn't enough to kill off cash, Crypto will be the final blow before a collapse.Think about this for a moment... What actually backs the U.S. dollar? And so what actually backs Cryptocurrency?Difference is, cash can be hidden, undetectable and washed as necessary. Block chains can't and won't and when they are government or country owned, or worse, run on THEIR INTERNET, THEIR 5G and through THEIR CPUS, as well as every smart device???Do the math. 10-15 years ago, people were worried about RFI strips in everything? This far surpasses that.Crypto, secure and untraceable? You people who believe that really are gullible sheep.They aren't going to provide ANYTHING that will ultimately give you the keys to your own Freedom, including President Trump, lol.As for Trump, as much as I want to like or love him, he's been groomed for this job for a very long time. Since the 80's when first asked on Oprah if he would become President, to being an icon and actor in the Hollywood scene, along with what famous phrase of his? Oh yeah, \"You're Fired!\". How many people has he fired since he got into office? Exactly, this is all more bread and circuses.Australia is limiting cash transactions to $10k and if they allow the USD to tank, they have to have something the American people (and it's wealth) can convert over to. You think they are going to allow them to invest and use Yuan or some other foreign currency? You think there's a printing press with some other devalued paper or will the USD still be used at a devalued amount?No, Crypto is the ULTIMATE Mark of the Beast as in, without it, no man shall do business.

The transaction was an end-to-end trade between a buyer and a seller and their respective banks that was completed on one shared digital application rather than multiple systems, according to HSBC. It was the first scalable live trade finance transaction using blockchain, it added. Blockchain helps to streamline the traditional paper-intensive process in trade finance, which normally requires between five and 10 days to exchange documents, HSBC said.

These are words that a lot of people have heard and don’t understand. But bitcoin sounds like money, that’s the only thing everyone knows for sure.\nOK, here’s how it works. If you buy bitcoins you don’t receive physical coins. What you get is an entry in a ledger kept on the internet, an entry that says you have that many bitcoins and only you can access and spend them.\nBitcoin – an internet ledger entry representing the monetary value which the buyer paid in conventional money for the entry – is the brainchild of a person or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins became available in January, 2009, and you could have bought one for $2.89. The value of bitcoin rose rapidly over the next eight years and by the end of 2016 buyers were paying around $1,000, an astonishing 300-fold increase! Then the real fun began. In the next twelve months bitcoin soared to about $20,000. Now, you know what’s coming next. Like the tulip bulb mania in 1637, people stopped buying, owners began selling, and the market for Bitcoin fell in a steep jagged plunge.\nBitcoin had been designed as a medium of exchange, a global internet currency, but instead it had clearly become an asset, like tulip bulbs, coffee beans or Impressionist paintings, a thing people were buying with the expectation that they could turn around and sell it at a higher price later.\nBitcoin had been designed as a currency that would facilitate global trade without the use of middlemen. Conventional currencies work well enough, but to use them in national or global trade means using of banks, and paying banks for their service adds to the cost of doing business. Furthermore, governments can manipulate and in some measure control the flow of currencies, and that can bring unpredictable costs to business, too. What makes, or made, bitcoin so attractive is that it isn’t controlled by anyone.\nNot only that. Bitcoin transactions are done without banks or governments even seeing what’s going on. The transactions are extremely secure. The system which is used to keep the ledger online, safe and private, is called blockchain.\nWhen you purchase bitcoin, that transaction is recorded in the online ledger and the record of that transaction is distributed to other computers in the blockchain network and validated by certain protocols to becomes part of an ongoing chain of transactions. You receive a unique digital “key” that gives only you access the your account. If you forget it or lose the paper on which you wrote it down, there’s no way to recover or regenerate it.\nNow you can use your bitcoin account to buy something — say a commodity like rice — from a person who sells rice and accepts bitcoin in exchange. By the rules of the blockchain game, the record of your bitcoin disbursement must refer to the earlier record whereby you acquired those bitcoin funds. Your current transaction, paying to purchase something, is gathered into a block with other transactions and that block has a cryptographic reference to a previous block and an encrypted digital “fingerprint.” When it’s completed, the block is sent to the other computers in the network and becomes part of the blockchain.\nPutting together a block of bitcoin transactions requires a lot of heavy mathematical lifting and an enormous amount of computer time. The end product is a series of blocks of transactions chained together in such a mathematical way as to make them extremely secure from hackers, thieves and governments.\nBitcoin and blockchain couldn’t exist until the digital age. Working together the two make a global currency system that has no central bank and no governmental backing. In that fashion it resembles one of the earliest and longest lasting global currencies ever, cowrie shells. A cowrie is a small mussel; something like a little clam with a single shiny decorated shell that’s curled around itself, leaving a small open slit. Cowrie shells were used as currency in China beginning three thousand years ago and have been used in different parts of the globe up into the 19th century. They didn’t have computers, that’s all.

The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n“What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?” said Rich Myers, goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.”\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n“We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,” SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . “The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like ‘net-neutrality.’\n“The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,” said SW. “We’re making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.”\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou.

Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion.\n\"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.\nLast month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures.\nZcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity.\nGemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.\n\"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office.\nThe Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website.\nThey also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Led by Mr. Donald D’Avanzo, Director of Datacenter Operations, approximately 20 Antminer S9 Bitcoin Mining units were installed and have been running for approximately three weeks.\nAfter successful Phase I implementation and operational execution of the initial mining units, the Company has invested in 20 additional S9 antminers plus 82 new L3 Litecoin antminers to improve the project hash rate. 32 new GPU mining rigs consisting of a total of 192 Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 cards will be brought online to diversify the portfolio of cryptocurrency altcoins mined. The new units will allow the Company to mine the top five most profitable GPU altcoins; Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Monero, ZCash, and Ubiq.\nAdditionally Teraforge is working closely with ColocationGuard executive leadership to secure one of only three available anchor tenant slots in a new state-of-the-art dedicated mining facility located within the Northeast, currently referred to internally as ‘Site 4’ for security purposes.\nJonathan Read, Chief Executive Officer of TimefireVR, d/b/a TeraForge, stated, “We are pleased with the successful implementation of our bitcoin mining strategy with Donald and his team at their first class, secure, facility in New York. The seamless integration in a relatively short amount of time has offered us the luxury of exploring further investment and expansion opportunities. This phase is to thoroughly test our integration and predictive systems before we enter into a much larger build out of our capacity. We look forward to getting all of our new mining equipment up and running allowing us to diversify into other cryptocurrencies.”\nThe Company terminated its letter of intent (‘LOI’) to make a strategic investment and acquire a license in Cryptogram, LLC.\nMr. Read continued, “After careful review, in the best interest of the Company’s future and its shareholders, the Company has decided to terminate its LOI with Cryprogram. The Board and management agree to focus all of its efforts and working capital on its mining strategy.”\nAbout ColoGuard Enterprise Solutions, LLC As Brooklyn’s only data center and carrier-neutral hotel for all major fiber providers, ColocationGuard Enterprise Solutions, LLC (ColocationGuard) operates over 60,000 square feet of colocation space in both Brooklyn and Northern New Jersey.
