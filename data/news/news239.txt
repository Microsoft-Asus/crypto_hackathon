On Tuesday, CFTC regulated derivatives exchange, LedgerX, launched a Bitcoin savings account, the latest in a slew of traditional banking products made available for the digital currency.\nLedgerX is an institutional trading platform that touts itself as the first federally regulated exchange to offer and execute Bitcoin swaps and options for institutional investors. Although their management team derives from some of the most recognizable institutions in finance, unlike derivatives exchanges like Cboe and CME Group, LedgerX is entirely crypto-focused.\nTheir latest product breaks new ground for the investment products available for digital currencies. Regulated Bitcoin Savings Accounts\nThese savings accounts will have a holding duration of three, six, or twelve-months periods, and the company expects annual returns as high as 16%.\nFor investors, these accounts pay interest in dollars rather than additional Bitcoin, and the rates vary by account, although the company didn’t specific details on the variance. Moreover, the company will charge a transaction fee for each service provided to the investor.\nIn a nod to the potential for high-yield volatility from Bitcoin, the account’s product page reminds investors that they have the potential for investments to double in value if Bitcoin prices increase while in the savings account.\nIn this way, investors see savings accounts as a way to earn additional returns on their Bitcoin investment or as a way to hedge against loss should the value of the digital currency depreciate while in the account.\nMost importantly, it diversifies the crypto investment opportunities by moving beyond buy and hold strategies or futures contracts. New Norms in Bitcoin Markets\nIn comments to Forbes , LedgerX co-founder, Juthica Chou, notes that their new savings account is just a more streamlined version of the activity already happening on their platform. She estimates that half of the platform’s activity is the long-form workaround of this same scenario.\nChou conveyed that they company completes $30 million in monthly transactions and 70% of that derives from options trades. Before the savings account, platform users use a call overwrite where an investor issues an option for a later time with at a higher rate. The new account simplifies this workaround.\nAs a result, Chou acknowledge:\n“This interface will definitely be skewed to long bitcoin holder who will likely only deposit bitcoin and who will want to earn interest off of that bitcoin.” Related Story: Bitcoin Futures Posting New Highs In Daily Volume\nIn contrast, Bitcoin futures contracts offered by Cboe and CME are most popular among Bitcoin bears who bet that the digital currency will decrease in value over time.\nThere is an expanding repertoire of institutional investment products for Bitcoin, which can further increase digital currencies by making them available to more people with more money to spend.\nLedgerX’s new product announcement occurs during what many dubbed “blockchain week,” in conjunction with Consensus , a three-day conference taking place in New York City. What’s more, at a time when speculation and concern about crypto regulation is at an all-time high, LedgerX understands that a fully regulated and audited product that should provide protection for the company should new norms be established in the future.

Set up the software by linking it to your worker created in Step 7. “Click Settings” > “Account…”. Beside “User Name:” use the username you created when creating the BitMinter account. Beside “Worker Name:” and “Worker Password:” enter the worker name and worker password you created in Step 6. If the window is small, click the button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then click the “Engine Start” button beside each of the devices you want to use. For reference, I get about 65 Mhps (million hashes per second). 1000 Khps = 1 Mhps. Test all of your devices, but you should really only bother running devices that get you 25 Mhps or above. You will also want to change a few settings regarding automation. I leave my computer on all day and all night. I normally turn off the mining as soon as I get home from work (around 6:00) and have the miner start on its own at night in case I forget to start it when I’m done with my computer. Go to Settings > Options to change these settings. Look at the fourth picture to set it up like how I have it set up. The picture has explanations.\nAutomated devices are a list of devices that you set so that you can start them on their own automatically when the software starts. I have selected one of my devices as automated so that when the software starts, only that device starts. See fourth picture for more details. Step 9: Mine. Let your computer run while it mines! Running it at night is a good idea as it will double the amount of money you make. Good luck making money. Step 10: Spend Your Bitcoins. What good is a currency if you can’t spend it? The answer is it’s not. There are lots of things you can do. Below is a list: Gamble. SatoshiDice. Bitzino. Peerbet. RoyalBitcoin. Buy various merchandise. Some online vendors are starting to accept bitcoins s a way of purchasing items. Buy Coffee at http://bitcoincoffee.com/ . Trade it for PayPal money. Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange. The last one I want to talk about it Mt. Gox. It is the most common website used to trade (buy or sell) bitcoins for dollars or any other national currency. You can receive this money through PayPal or many other online currency transfer services. I am not going to go through the details of this, but to send bitcoins to anyone or any service, follow the instructions in the next step.\nStep 11: Send Bitcoins to Someone. To use bitcoins, you must send bitcoins to another address. To send bitcoins, the service will give you a specific address to send bitcoins to. Copy this address. Open up your bitcoin wallet. Click on the “Send coins” tab. Enter the address you want to send the coins to in the “Pay to” field. If you are going to send coins to this person or group multiple times, you can enter a label for this person so that you can find them in your address book again. Enter the amount in the next field (for easy math, remember that 1 BTC is $10). Click send when you are done. If you just want to practice sending bitcoins to someone, you can test sending them to me. Just send 0.01 BTC to me (approx. 10 cents). Good luck. Step 12: Done. And that is just about all the basic information about bitcoins. If you have any questions, or there is something really obvious and important that I had missed, drop me a comment. I’ll try to respond as quickly as possible. If you want to donate, send me a bitcoin or two at 16bVf7XX3dKN2zW6ut8FRSQaGZZBHAFYZt. Any donations, no matter how big or small, will be appreciated.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martedì giugno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network author", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T09:03:34.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "569c98c32471a2c82b646fd551c3c7356564cf02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0aEKOnd72wQxOTVVjV6nt55JfLyvxq4jRLxNOTXi4BzVBOHKqMv9QKlsYdNxkc4rtVQnBXobJuMpLQmWuQi9xRv98mgKpvOyA80cz1d73k9s.pjaCd.0m7gw--", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "Better Than The Bolivar, But Bitcoin Is Far From The Perfect Solution", "title_full": "Better Than The Bolivar, But Bitcoin Is Far From The Perfect Solution - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2018-05-17T09:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "569c98c32471a2c82b646fd551c3c7356564cf02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0aEKOnd72wQxOTVVjV6nt55JfLyvxq4jRLxNOTXi4BzVBOHKqMv9QKlsYdNxkc4rtVQnBXobJuMpLQmWuQi9xRv98mgKpvOyA80cz1d73k9s.pjaCd.0m7gw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Guest Contributors", "published": "2018-05-17T09:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Better Than The Bolivar, But Bitcoin Is Far From The Perfect Solution", "text": "Better Than The Bolivar, But Bitcoin Is Far From The Perfect Solution May 17, 2018, 01:02:00 PM EDT By Guest Contributors Shutterstock photo\nBy Eiland Glover, Co-Founder and CEO of Kowala\nPrices in Venezuela rose 454 percent in the first three months of 2018 and hyperinflation is expected to hit 13,000% by year’s end, so it’s no surprise that many local businesses now refuse to accept the bolívar, Venezuela’s national currency.\nVenezuela’s current financial crisis is the creation of its socialist autocracy, founded in 1998 by the now-deceased Hugo Chavez and led today by his acolyte, Nicolas Maduro. Chavez took power using an age-old mass brain hack: amid the pain of economic crisis, he concocted scapegoats to trigger tribal group-think among a constituency and get himself elected.\nOnce elected, Chavez exacerbated the crisis and consolidated power. He changed the constitution, neutered the legislature, abolished term limits, expropriated private property, and manipulated the currency. Maduro now follows a similar playbook. The government’s currency manipulation has turned Venezuela into an ATM for the over-fed Maduro and his cronies and a hellscape for its citizenry, many of whom now eat out of garbage cans.\nMaduro, who will undoubtedly win the upcoming sham election , recently claimed to join our ranks as a fellow cryptocurrency pioneer. His Petro cryptocurrency is intended to help the regime skirt U.S. sanctions and source foreign investment.\nBut the aims of the centralized, (supposedly) oil-backed Petro fly in the face of the crypto industry’s ethos. While cryptocurrency is dedicated to decentralization, empowering individuals, removing intermediaries, and increasing human freedom, the Petro is maximally centralized, relying squarely on the central authority of the Maduro regime.\nWhat’s more, the Petro could be engineered to allow fine-grained government control far beyond what is possible with traditional fiat currency. Indeed, financial advisory company Weiss Ratings does not even recognize the Petro as a cryptocurrency, declaring it instead a fiat currency.\nA better solution for Venezuelans would be a true cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, which could potentially bring unparalleled financial freedom to citizens of Venezuela and those of other autocratic countries. With digital currencies, those living in places with serious inflationary problems (in large part caused by extreme government centralization), can now, for the first time, have access to alternative stores of value.\nOn a secondary level, with the adoption of digital currencies, those marginalized from the international financial system also gain the ability to transact globally despite established government restrictions. Theoretically, the ease with which people can now transfer value will have huge implications for the quality of life of citizens suffering within the confines of broken economies. The decentralized public ledger means that access to cryptocurrencies should translate to access to global job roles as well.\nYet Bitcoin is a flawed fix.\nLast month Bitcoin surged 14 percent in an hour after falling nearly 70 percent in under a month at the start of the year. With the bolívar, Venezuelans can see the price of milk double by the time they reach the checkout line in a grocery store. Adding Bitcoin to the mix introduces a whole new level of instability over very short periods of time.\nForced to choose between the lesser of two financial evils, many in collapsing economies have nowhere to turn.\nThe solution lies in the emergence of “stable” coins.\nThis next generation of cryptocurrencies aims to maintain stable price pegs through innovative measures like supply management algorithms, or, in some cases, through physical asset backing (such as gold, silver, or even the USD). Stable coins offer the best of both worlds. They bring with them the financial freedom from centralized authorities so desperately needed by those in countries with collapsing economies while at the same time bringing the stability needed to function as a consumer or business with tight margins. With a reputable stablecoin, a Venezuelan citizen can avoid fears of hyperinflation, meaning they’ll be able to confidently store their wealth and transact freely and predictably.\nAs the crypto market develops, it seems likely that the winners will emerge where cryptocurrencies are needed most acutely, in the economies such as Venezuela with collapsing fiat currencies.

Although the block size increase is quite a feat, BCH developers have also expanded the network’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some old Satoshi OP_Codes that were previously removed from earlier codebases. Now over the past 24-hours, lots of people have been playing around with the new BCH features.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features Experimenting With the New Bitcoin Cash OP_Codes\nLots of BCH community members have been discussing the new OP_Code features and the additional space added to the network’s default data-carrier-size. The first signs of people messing around with the new features came from the Memo and Blockpress developers as both platform’s increased posting character limit from 79 to 217. Both Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters.\nThis means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain.

The script is <String1><String2> OP_XOR OP_HASH256 <hash1> OP_EQUAL. It’s solved by finding the secret String1 that when XORed with String2, after hashing should be equal to hash1.

This address is etching the entire Bible into the blockchain.\nUK Cryptocurrency estimates that the entire Bible may cost around $100 USD (0.08 BCH) and add around 8MB to the BCH chain.

Although the block size increase is quite a feat, BCH developers have also expanded the network’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some old Satoshi OP_Codes that were previously removed from earlier codebases. Now over the past 24-hours, lots of people have been playing around with the new BCH features.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features Experimenting With the New Bitcoin Cash OP_Codes\nLots of BCH community members have been discussing the new OP_Code features and the additional space added to the network’s default data-carrier-size. The first signs of people messing around with the new features came from the Memo and Blockpress developers as both platform’s increased posting character limit from 79 to 217. Both Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters.\nThis means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain.

For an obvious reason: It will help address multiple barriers to investing in major cryptocurrencies.\n“Investing in cryptocurrency is complicated for the majority of investors,” explains Jonathan Benassaya , CEO and Founder of IronChain. “The four main barriers to invest are custody, liquidity, diversification and fees. IronChain’s solution addresses those four issues by allowing daily liquidity to all investors without any lockup, with an annual fee of 1% (the most economical of the market). There are no performance nor loading or redemption fees, an index-based portfolio of 10 of the largest protocols with a market cap weighting, and an institutional grade custody through xapo, kingdom and ledger. With this product, investors can invest in the cryptocurrency market in a product as close as possible to a regular mutual fund.”\nMEDIA Protocol CEO, James Tabor agrees. \"This approach will make crypto more accessible to new investors, and any influx of money is good for the wider market.\"\nEiland Glover, CEO of Kowala, an autonomously stablized cryptocurrency is also positive on the introduction of index funds, though he thinks they benefit mostly accredited investors. “While this move will definitely increase accessibility, at this stage, it will mostly affect accredited investors rather than retail investors,” says Glover. “Billions of dollars of accredited investor money has remained on the sidelines because investing in crypto has thus far been difficult and has felt quite risky. An entire class of investors has been listening to buddies tell stories over beers about the ways they’ve made 4000% returns, and as such, are likely to eagerly embrace a simpler and more secure way to enter the market. Ultimately, we hope this kind of product can be made available to retail investors, as such an evolution would drive growth and industry comfort levels as the pool grows larger.”\n7d Performance of Major Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrency %24H %7d Change Bitcoin -3.18 -7.54 Ethereum -3.22 -4.24 Ripple -5.41 -13.32 Source: Coinmarketcap.com 5/15/18 at 3.30 p.m.\n[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

IronChain’s solution addresses those four issues by allowing daily liquidity to all investors without any lockup, with an annual fee of 1% (the most economical of the market). There are no performance nor loading or redemption fees, an index-based portfolio of 10 of the largest protocols with a market cap weighting, and an institutional grade custody through xapo, kingdom and ledger. With this product, investors can invest in the cryptocurrency market in a product as close as possible to a regular mutual fund.”\nMEDIA Protocol CEO, James Tabor agrees. \"This approach will make crypto more accessible to new investors, and any influx of money is good for the wider market.\"\nEiland Glover, CEO of Kowala, an autonomously stablized cryptocurrency is also positive on the introduction of index funds, though he thinks they benefit mostly accredited investors. “While this move will definitely increase accessibility, at this stage, it will mostly affect accredited investors rather than retail investors,” says Glover. “Billions of dollars of accredited investor money has remained on the sidelines because investing in crypto has thus far been difficult and has felt quite risky. An entire class of investors has been listening to buddies tell stories over beers about the ways they’ve made 4000% returns, and as such, are likely to eagerly embrace a simpler and more secure way to enter the market. Ultimately, we hope this kind of product can be made available to retail investors, as such an evolution would drive growth and industry comfort levels as the pool grows larger.”\n7d Performance of Major Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrency %24H %7d Change Bitcoin -3.18 -7.54 Ethereum -3.22 -4.24 Ripple -5.41 -13.32 Source: Coinmarketcap.com 5/15/18 at 3.30 p.m.\n[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,340 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is facing many hurdles on the upside near $1,340 and $1,350 resistance levels. Bitcoin cash price is slowly recovering from $1,220 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may correct in the short term, but gains above $1,350 won't be easy.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance Yesterday, there was a sharp downside move below $1,300 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price even traded below the $1,240 support level and almost tested the $1,200 support. A low was formed near $1,220 before the price started an upside recovery. It moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,490 high to $1,220 low.\nIt also succeeded in clearing the $1,300 resistance, but there are many barriers on the upside. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,340 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,490 high to $1,220 low is placed near the $1,360 level to act as a crucial resistance. In short, it seems like there is a major barrier forming near $1,340 and $1,350 resistance levels . A break and close above $1,350 may well push the price towards the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is the next resistance before $1,400.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing positive signs above $1,240. However, a break and close above $1,350, $1,380 and $1,400 won't be easy. On the downside, supports are seen at $1,300 and $1,240.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,240\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,350\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Facing Uphill Task appeared first

annual Blockchain conference Consensus failed to spark the wave of buying pressure that some analysts had anticipated.\nBitcoin fell 3.25% to $8,255.2 on the Bitfinex exchange and remained close to session lows of $8,100.0.\nNew insights into the current crypto environment from market participants attending the conference were few and far between, providing little reason for investors to pile into bitcoin.\nSome participants claimed the general takeaway from the conference was \"Blockchain continues to be in an embryonic phase, with speculators eager to cash in.\"\nIn the run up to the conference, some had claimed it would act as the touch-paper for a rally in bitcoin but the \"consensus pump\" failed to materialize as sentiment on cryptocurrencies remained negative following renewed regulatory fears.\n“Bottom line: We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus,” Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors said prior to this week’s Consensus conference in New York.\nThe topic of regulation was hotly debated at the conference, media reports suggested, but it lacked fresh perspective drawing a muted a reaction from cryptos.\nThe drop in total crypto market cap further below $400 billion signalled the lack of the demand for cryptos amid widespread selling.\nRipple XRP fell 2.78% to $0.67836 on the Poloniex exchange, while Ethereum fell 2.32% to $695.77.\nBitcoin Cash fell 6.48% to $1,263.60, while Litecoin fell 1.57% to $138.19.\nRelated Articles\nHomemine ICO Review: Plug in Your Appliances and

Those lucky guys who purchased or mined just a few bitcoins at the start of the age of cryptocurrency nowadays can boast about their savings. However, some of them are now in a painful limbo，because they can't remember the complex security passwords needed to get to their bitcoin wallet. Unlike a bank, bitcoin has no central hotline to call for a reset. This is really a bad thing，it's like forgetting a bank account password, but there's no bank to call to reset it. That money is lost forever. That might be a lot of money at today’s exchange rate.\nActyally, this bad thing happened to me last year, and my friend recommend this website： http://recovermybtc.com/ to me，she said she has retrieved her bitcoin wallet password through it，and I download this software，it really works after I used it，and you need to pay some service fee to them, but it's not high,and I had retrieved my password through it,but I'm worried that after I use this software, my trading will be recorded in the software in the future,is it affected the money in my bitcoin wallet?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://recovermybtc.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T07:44:54.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1cba33b57b6de67482a0a66a675d2aa0e0d50fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQg.jO.w9prhE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-05-17T07:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.084, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1cba33b57b6de67482a0a66a675d2aa0e0d50fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQg.jO.w9prhE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BobLawblaw", "published": "2018-05-17T07:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Meanwhile, in BCash Land, many lulz are being had.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T03:08:14.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e69a19f31c1d2b2fe425de47703e9799545a15eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTRNdeBdf9XB3US1UuZBP9tg3phYDuqdr0NjdTgvfUa19liEjbBGQNw75KYoPljxUakN93Hf2ASPcoGFVxfMvF_GcyuV36DqWsA6GKwa73Ct_oKlA9JHNo7", "site_full": "www.gearfuse.com", "site": "gearfuse.com", "site_section": "http://www.gearfuse.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gearfuse", "title": "Which of These Fascinating Bitcoin Uses Could Change the World?", "title_full": "Which of These Fascinating Bitcoin Uses Could Change the World?", "published": "2018-05-17T07:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gearfuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-cash.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e69a19f31c1d2b2fe425de47703e9799545a15eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTRNdeBdf9XB3US1UuZBP9tg3phYDuqdr0NjdTgvfUa19liEjbBGQNw75KYoPljxUakN93Hf2ASPcoGFVxfMvF_GcyuV36DqWsA6GKwa73Ct_oKlA9JHNo7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andrew", "published": "2018-05-17T07:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Which of These Fascinating Bitcoin Uses Could Change the World?", "text": "Which of These Fascinating Bitcoin Uses Could Change the World? Share tweet\nMany people still view bitcoin as being a temporary trend or niche product. Yet, with new and innovative uses for this cryptocurrency appearing all the time, it seems to be just a matter of time before it is considered a mainstream currency.\nThe following are some of the fascinating new uses for bitcoin. Some may change the world while others simply make life easier for us. Will any of them persuade you to make the switch to this digital currency? Source: Pixabay Online Gaming Made More Secure\nOne of the huge advantages of using a digital currency like this is that it is safer and more secure. This is because bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, meaning that there is no need to link your online spending to a real-world bank account or credit card.\nDue to this, an increasing number of players are making the switch to bitcoin casino playing. In this way, they can fund their account and make withdrawals solely in bitcoin. This makes gambling online easier as well as more secure.\nThankfully, the selection of games on these sites is just as impressive as at other online casinos. If we look at the VegasCasino site, for instance, we can see that it is possible to take online spins on dozens of games, such as Satoshi’s Secret, Wolf Gold, Queen of the Seas, and 888 Dragons. Freer Societies\nA way in which we can see the vast potential of digital currencies is with the free societies and breakaway communities being set up all over the world. One such example that has been in the news lately is Fort Galt in Chile.\nThis is described as being a start-up community for entrepreneurs. It is just one of a number of similar communities that have sprung in different corners of the planet, with Liberland, Free Society, and Seasteading among the most well-known to date.\nA note of caution came with the collapse of a similar attempt called Galt’s Gulch Chile , though. One of the founders of the new project is called Gabriel Scheare, and he says that they have learned a lot from the failure of the earlier attempt. Source: Pixabay Bitcoin Hotels\nOne of the main benefits of using a cryptocurrency is that you can spend money freely anywhere in the world where it is legal to use it. This means that bitcoin would appear to be the ideal choice for anyone who plans to travel the planet freely and without any worries.\nCan you imagine being able to set off from home with just your bitcoin account to fund your travel adventures? A big move towards this becoming possible has come with the introduction of travel services that can be paid for with this currency.\nOne of the latest examples to hit the news headlines was El Tiburón Hotel in La Carihuela, Spain. This place recently became the very first hotel in Andalusia to accept cryptocurrencies payments. Indeed, they now accept bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash , Ether, and Litecoin.\nWith new uses for bitcoin appearing all the time, it is likely that more people will decide to start using it. Will it change your world if you give it a try?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://panampost.com/rebeca-morla/2015/12/23/defrauded-investors-file-lawsuit-to-recover-galts-gulch-chile/", "https://pixabay.com/es/bitcoin-kryptowaluty-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%B0-3006247/", "https://vegascasino.io/casino", "https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/world-cryptocurrencies-country/", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://pixabay.com/es/poker-as-fichas-dinero-juego-1999643/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:14:16.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5923feaa2967891d34074f3782e6ce48a8c350fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipF2YZiB_H.5io4yqPQ3y34PP4qzQK2XZbdgV2l.Q7AXfevfUMhCYRN1ApRTN8GU2hU.NP7_p5EaVsEzYqDnxsLoroSAcfzLHhhLWQIjnyDwDStkwpXSpO_xq_zPk7KX30lXjSWvyjLlE-", "site_full": "www.asit.com.es", "site": "asit.com.es", "site_section": "http://www.asit.com.es/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News As It Comes!", "title": "Bitcoin price CRASH: Cryptocurrency price falls to almost $8,000 after turbulent 24 hours", "title_full": "Bitcoin price CRASH: Cryptocurrency price falls to almost $8,000 after turbulent 24 hours", "published": "2018-05-17T07:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.asit.com.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/960933_1-1-150x150.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5923feaa2967891d34074f3782e6ce48a8c350fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipF2YZiB_H.5io4yqPQ3y34PP4qzQK2XZbdgV2l.Q7AXfevfUMhCYRN1ApRTN8GU2hU.NP7_p5EaVsEzYqDnxsLoroSAcfzLHhhLWQIjnyDwDStkwpXSpO_xq_zPk7KX30lXjSWvyjLlE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-17T07:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price CRASH: Cryptocurrency price falls to almost $8,000 after turbulent 24 hours", "text": "Business | By admin Bitcoin price CRASH: Cryptocurrency price falls to almost $8,000 after turbulent 24 hours\nBITCOIN has dramatically crashed to almost $ 8,000 in a major drop as it loses almost three per cent of its value in 24 hours, after a shocking 6 per cent decrease the day before.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:04:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c9f18352711464c23f1a43882931b8d29df381d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8YNb_9Hqnh6xhf6rW8xrcE4E3z.HSHC6z.Ck6lb4J9dym1eVQGK9ittLckREzeWvQu9n88WcNicgCqgAG1Wbyrc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

Price has quite a way to go before testing the neckline at $8,800. An upside break could lead to an uptrend of the same height as the double bottom formation. Bitcoin price formed a double bottom pattern on its 1-hour time frame and needs to break past the neckline to confirm the climb.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the downtrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 200 SMA lines up with the pattern's neckline to add to its strength as a ceiling. If it holds, another bottom could be formed.\nRSI is on the move up to indicate that buyers have enough energy to push for more gains, but the oscillator is also nearing overbought levels to reflect exhaustion. Stochastic is also heading north but could be due to turn back down form overbought levels soon, so bitcoin price might follow suit.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nInvestors continue to hold out for positive updates in the industry but until those come out, caution has prevailed after bitcoin price was rejected at one resistance level after another. Traders are also keeping close tabs on the investigation into South Korea's largest crypto exchange as this revives issues on regulation and security.\nIn contrast, the dollar has been firmly supported by stronger rate hike hopes, particularly for the Fed meeting in June. Although some data points have fallen short of estimates, traders are paying closer attention to positive figures on inflation and shrugging off downbeat remarks from FOMC members.\nLooking ahead, it could be all about market sentiment from here as a week without industry developments could draw more sellers in.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Eyes on This Classic Reversal Pattern appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T07:18:38.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "753c7cc283d8b3f792d67b31ea96436f4156ca88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU3UVLa5ALjcbmGr7xRLa6o-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN][ICO][AIRDROP] BICOTI (BIC) ✔ THE FASTER BITCOIN PAYMENT ✔", "title_full": "[ANN][ICO][AIRDROP] BICOTI (BIC) ✔ THE FASTER BITCOIN PAYMENT ✔", "published": "2018-05-17T07:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "753c7cc283d8b3f792d67b31ea96436f4156ca88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU3UVLa5ALjcbmGr7xRLa6o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tathagatas", "published": "2018-05-17T07:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN][ICO][AIRDROP] BICOTI (BIC) ✔ THE FASTER BITCOIN PAYMENT ✔", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://etherscan.io/token/0xdbf60d2e1727c0b412aae78b9a243f7c0c10936f", "http://bicoti.com/", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG3IEcptSlqWGnUmMH9kgdG4ULmnlzZdbWxNiM4alGET4xKA/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://twitter.com/BICOTI1/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:26:34.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3a2e1ff6f47cdd15e7202005ce1d10f57340857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Tr06Fv2Oeyh4WRt83cf6R8tFhF8VaEwKNb5Lia3O4Yb4.ZwJeK4TKZ1tC7o.7xMol7RumUjwj.feTzvGnKlXQex5diYe7d4tvJ8wJ6.YHVwofJ_O9Y3oJLojwHn3SplrOi4MQdmyzBHZOVJHbIzbOk", "site_full": "ads.googler7ty.com", "site": "googler7ty.com", "site_section": "http://ads.googler7ty.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "ads r7ty", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, May 16", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, May 16", "published": "2018-05-17T07:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3a2e1ff6f47cdd15e7202005ce1d10f57340857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Tr06Fv2Oeyh4WRt83cf6R8tFhF8VaEwKNb5Lia3O4Yb4.ZwJeK4TKZ1tC7o.7xMol7RumUjwj.feTzvGnKlXQex5diYe7d4tvJ8wJ6.YHVwofJ_O9Y3oJLojwHn3SplrOi4MQdmyzBHZOVJHbIzbOk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-17T07:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, May 16", "text": "18 0 The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said that Bitcoin could emerge as a possible competitor to the US dollar in the future. He also did not rule out the prospects of the FED launching its own cryptocurrency, though he said that there was no plan at the moment. Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the fifth largest bank in the world by assets, is exploring options to launch its own cryptocurrency, known as MUFG Coin . It plans to test it by the next year. The existing cryptocurrencies are gearing up for a likely competition by introducing upgrades that can improve operations. Additionally, the crypto exchanges are launching new products targeting the institutional investors. All of these point to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the acceptance that the blockchain technology can be a game changer. The long-term investors should welcome any fall in prices as it offers an opportunity to buy the digital currencies at a discount. Let’s see if we find any buy setups today. BTC/USD Bitcoin has broken below the 50-day SMA after holding it for the past four days, which is a bearish development. The only major support now is $7,941.68. If this level breaks, a drop to $7,000 is likely. If the $7,941.68 level holds, the BTC/USD pair might enter a period of consolidation between $7,941-$10,000. Once the range is confirmed, we shall try to trade it by buying close to the support and covering the position at the resistance. Currently, there are no buy setups, hence, we suggest waiting until a reliable pattern develops. ETH/USD Ethereum failed to break out of $745 on May 14 and turned down from there. It has broken below the 20-day EMA today. The small neckline of a possible head and shoulders pattern is providing a strong support level. Today, prices have rebounded sharply from it. The ETH/USD pair might consolidate between the neckline of the bearish pattern and $745. A break above the overhead resistance will be a positive move. Therefore, we suggest long positions above $750 with a close stop loss. The immediate target is a move to $838. This is a risky trade, hence we recommend traders to take a small position (about 30 percent of usual). If the bears succeed in breaking and closing below the neckline, the bearish pattern will complete, giving it a target of $418. However, we believe that $600, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-day SMA will act as strong support on the downside. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has broken down of the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If it closes (UTC) below the neckline, it will have a pattern target of $650. However, the bulls are unlikely to give up without a fight. The levels to watch out for on the downside are the horizontal support at $1221 and the 50-day SMA. We anticipate a bounce from either of these two levels. However, it is difficult to predict whether the rebound will sustain or fail. Though the 20-day EMA is turning down, the 50-day SMA is still trending up. Hence, we believe that the BCH/USD pair is unlikely to sink to $650. If the $1221 support holds, a range bound action is probable. It is not clear whether the digital currency will go up or down from the present levels. Hence, we would prefer to watch from the sidelines. XRP/USD Ripple could not scale above the $0.76 levels on May 14, resulting in a slide below the 50-day SMA. The next support on the downside is the May 12 lows of $0.632. A break below this will sink the digital currency to the $0.562 levels. If the XRP/USD pair manages to stay above the $0.63 levels, the bulls will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.76. The 20-day EMA is turning down while the 50-day SMA is flattening out. As prices are quoting below both the moving averages and are some distance away from the critical support of the large range, we shall not propose any long positions. XLM/USD Stellar turned down from the 20-day EMA as higher levels lacked buyers. Currently, prices are back at the 50-day SMA, which is critical support. If this level breaks, the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern is the final support. The bearish pattern will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below the neckline. The pattern target of such a break is way lower at $0.2. If the XLM/USD pair either holds the neckline or the 50-day SMA, a range bound action will ensue. Any more above the overhead resistance of $0.47766719 will be very bullish because it will invalidate the bearish pattern. We shall look for buying opportunities above $0.373 levels. LTC/USD The recovery in Litecoin hit a brick wall at the 20-day EMA on May 14. Currently, prices are again back below the horizontal support at $141. A break below the May 12 lows of $132.163 will open a downside target of $115. Both the moving averages are turning down. This increases the probability of a drop to the critical support levels of $115, which is expected to hold. If this support breaks, the LTC/USD pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern on a breakdown below $107, which will be very negative. The digital currency is showing weakness; hence, we have no buy recommendations. We shall change our view if the bulls manage to hold the May 12 lows and break out of $170. ADA/BTC Cardano is unable to find buyers at a higher level. The bounce off the trendline and the 50-day SMA on May 12 did not even break above the 20-day EMA. Prices are again back at the supports, increasing the chances of a breakdown. The 0.000025 levels had held up nicely from April 13 to April 15. So, if the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline, it can drop to this level. The 20-day EMA will continue to act as resistance on any up move. The digital currency will pick up momentum after scaling 0.00003445 levels. IOTA/USD IOTA has not done a great deal in the past five days. It is stuck between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. On the upside, immediate resistance is at the 20-day EMA and once this level is crossed the next hurdle is at $2.2117 levels. On the downside, supports exist at the 50-day SMA and $1.63. Both the moving averages are flattening out, which increases the possibility of a range bound action. We don’t find any buy setup on the IOTUSD pair, hence, are not suggesting any trade on it. EOS/USD EOS continues to correct. It is currently at the 50-day SMA, just below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. This is a critical level and should hold. The subsequent bounce will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. If the EOS/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to the next support at the bottom trendline at $10. The digital currency has lost momentum and is likely to remain range bound for a few days before starting a new trend. We shall revisit our view if it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel for a couple of days.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

There are many reasons for that, a major one being that bitcoin simply wasn’t designed to move money on that scale. But Square, which was one of the earliest of the major financial services companies to introduce bitcoin capabilities, wants to make the user experience of its bitcoin wallet simple enough to scale what has so far been quite complicated.\n“We want to go back to that original idea of having people purchase a coffee with it,” Dorsey said at Consensus, the New York blockchain and cryptocurrency conference happening this week. “Our focus is [on] how we get this to an everyday currency… We won’t necessarily be the company that comes up with the right framework, algorithms or technologies, but I do believe we’ll help with the simplifying of it, making it more straightforward and helping educate” consumers as well as regulators.\nTo do that, Square is leaning on its original approach of helping people complete sales and move money, rather than bucketing itself as a card reader or a software company.\nSquare was initially dedicated to building bitcoin in Square Cash so merchants could accept it without even knowing it; they’d be able to convert that bitcoin back to dollars using Square’s point-of-sale system. The company soon learned that was too difficult and went in another direction, buying and selling. The interfaces that existed were so complicated it felt inaccessible to everyday users.\n“The thing Square is good at is speed and simplicity,” Dorsey said. “We want those same lines in everything we do. … Where we have done well — credit card systems — is complex, scary and can be emotional. We did a good job making the seller side more down to earth, something you don’t have to think about at all. We want that same approach with bitcoin.”\nSquare has been expanding its product line over the last eight years. Initially a provider of payments hardware and software it has added the 6-year-old peer-to-peer Square Cash app, created an optional debit card (which users are increasingly using as their main checking account, Dorsey said) and cashback rewards feature. Walmart and McDonald’s are the two most popular places people use Square Cash; several of the top 10 places showing highest transaction volume are also fast-food restaurants, Dorsey said. It launched bitcoin trading through the Cash app in January and sold $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter. And earlier this month the company introduced a restaurant-specific POS system that would focus on hospitality needs. It also provides business financing to merchants using Square Capital.\nDorsey said he resists articulating a grand vision for the next five to 10 years but that it’s imperative that Square and other companies in the bitcoin and crypto ecosystems need to have the patience and give the air for applications on blockchain technology to grow and be adopted.\nFor Square, it’s crucial to continue watching how people use bitcoin today. There’s incentive built into the technology to just hold it, encouraging saving over spending, Dorsey acknowledged, but making it easy to spend and transact everyday is where Square is focused.\nBeyond Square’s business, the internet needs a native currency that’s invented, evolved, critiqued and developed on the internet — and it will have it, Dorsey said.\n“The internet deserves a native currency; it will have a native currency,” Dorsey said. “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin or not. I hope it will be.”\nThat will pave the way for companies like Square to release different apps in app stores globally rather than the five markets Square operates in today, removing the need to find banking partners in each market and work through the regulations specific to each jurisdiction. As a centralized corporation, however, it can be difficult to continue to encourage the openness of the blockchain ecosystem. Dorsey said he wanted to make sure nothing on the corporate side ever hinders development.\n“If it was truly global for us today, we could release Cash worldwide,” Dorsey said. “That’s our intention but its going to take some time and education.”\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "how square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T07:00:30.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "662543b9f73c584aea25557818ee49b56ed482ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va71sgsiS1Rjf4N3vWzi7gqtVYTMkUhQTQ2Lc_pTXADN2bm4_awk9QWlOd28zHBWio4l9Z71PXrOsZSa.zWElQ0K7aH86Ks9DHB2N_Dm53n7WD", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Are there some websites about brands of Bitcoin miners or Asic miners?", "title_full": "Are there some websites about brands of Bitcoin miners or Asic miners?", "published": "2018-05-17T06:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "662543b9f73c584aea25557818ee49b56ed482ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va71sgsiS1Rjf4N3vWzi7gqtVYTMkUhQTQ2Lc_pTXADN2bm4_awk9QWlOd28zHBWio4l9Z71PXrOsZSa.zWElQ0K7aH86Ks9DHB2N_Dm53n7WD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mocaco", "published": "2018-05-17T06:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are there some websites about brands of Bitcoin miners or Asic miners?", "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite\nHere I would like to find some websites that list the detailed information of mature brands or start-up brands of Asic miners or Bitcoin miners, but what I can get is quite a few.

2018\nBitcoin mining will use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by the end of the year, according to newly published, peer-reviewed study.\nWritten by economist and PricewaterhouseCoopers blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, the paper, “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” calculates bitcoin’s current energy use and its likely direction. The findings: At a minimum, bitcoin mining — the creation of bitcoin as well as the process by which transactions are verified — is now consuming 2.55 gigawatts a year, roughly the amount of energy used by the Republic of Ireland over the course of a year.\nIn the paper, published in the journal Joule, de Vries emphasized repeatedly that his estimates are on the absolute low side of how much power bitcoin mining is consuming. They come from estimating the number of devices connected to the bitcoin network, estimated to be around 10,000 nodes, but each node could be a single device or a group of machines at a mining facility.\nThe paper does make some presumptions, with the calculation marking “the first time that bitcoin miner production has been estimated with the help of upstream [chip] production numbers,” de Vries wrote. “Given the ongoing secrecy of bitcoin miner manufacturers, this could prove to be a valuable addition to the toolkit for substantiating trends in bitcoin’s electricity consumption.”\nAlthough de Vries tries to remain conservative in his estimates, he does believe that the amount of energy being used by bitcoin mining is multiple times higher, saying that mining operators could be sucking down as much as 7.67 gigawatts annually by the end of this year.\n“With the bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018,” de Vries noted. “Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duncan riley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "republic of ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T06:54:38.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbf6ec0ed25112253755c49cbabaf372f543b6f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZloVH3CzvuKeNponxP3tEqPg_E_RtHDvWAZTlcDJoQLakeQ.SMqIn7Nsw--", "site_full": "bitco.in", "site": "bitco.in", "site_section": "https://bitco.in/forum/forums/bitcoin-discussion.2/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion | Bitcoin Forum", "title": "Bitcoin Investment", "title_full": "Bitcoin Investment | Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-17T06:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.101, "main_image": "https://bitco.in/img/opengraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbf6ec0ed25112253755c49cbabaf372f543b6f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZloVH3CzvuKeNponxP3tEqPg_E_RtHDvWAZTlcDJoQLakeQ.SMqIn7Nsw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aminarh", "published": "2018-05-17T06:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Investment", "text": "Hello everyone join me on whatsapp for a seminar on how to invest in bitcoin\nJoin the seminar using below link\nhttps://chat.whatsapp.com/H8kp9u0kioAIxLikZo2DWP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://chat.whatsapp.com/H8kp9u0kioAIxLikZo2DWP"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T07:27:15.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dd8a93df7ef99f0e9cc022281781971a606ea89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8XQmxHdBwuqVXge1uPKjzDH2DWcL3o9UB1KqN4toI73GBusY_3vr7U407cEYLVNPrd2.xLZeULQa", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

This had been tried many times before but the main point of difference between Bitcoin and previous efforts like Digicash was that it was to be entirely decentralised. Without an overarching entity controlling the currency, the notion of “trust” would be removed from the system.\nTo combat “double spending”, the major flaw in all digital cash systems at that point, Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a revolutionary technology known as the blockchain to record all the transactions made with his currency.\nFor any single balance, transaction, or change to the network to take place, there would need to be consensus amongst those validating the network – the miners. Since Bitcoin’s invent, many other programmers have attempted to use the model and tweak it to provide what they consider to be a more functional form of digital cash.\nOther cryptocurrencies include Litecoin, Monero, Ether, and New Economy Movement. Many of these efforts tailor their currency for a special purpose.

This is why, bitcoin and blockchain-based markets give me faith in the future.\nsubmitted by /u/mariegiangrande\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T06:06:52.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1722b7e3cd4818b86f816dab20fa3c37d1b2383", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfWf.k8fMdHzCkwim5FmFSbnigQrIqQUroXr1EYGomKu_.Ap4FO5.5WfdE78Y3RITo8irn0JaXL95pApy4TC_R8ggQdDbzCWGVAC3mfClkEw--", "site_full": "squa.re", "site": "squa.re", "site_section": "http://squa.re/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SQUARE LUXURY", "title": "BlockBox Shipping Container Bitcoin Mining Datacenter", "title_full": "BlockBox Shipping Container Bitcoin Mining Datacenter", "published": "2018-05-17T06:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1722b7e3cd4818b86f816dab20fa3c37d1b2383", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfWf.k8fMdHzCkwim5FmFSbnigQrIqQUroXr1EYGomKu_.Ap4FO5.5WfdE78Y3RITo8irn0JaXL95pApy4TC_R8ggQdDbzCWGVAC3mfClkEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Uncrate", "published": "2018-05-17T06:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BlockBox Shipping Container Bitcoin Mining Datacenter", "text": " Men’s Lifestyle ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "blockbox shipping container bitcoin mining datacenter  men’s lifestyle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:36:12.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24bdbf192e1b0b15faf86827c86314fb72a3b4e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQK4CHUfMaTGKYn.N1K6LzdD5R9kbgSwBdPeDLUNP9zY9HgholStChRMd6xwVLdR3HjS3PyXBdkgNkE5YXqgcajA5tOthwClB0Hu10gtNB45qwsqJUCNu.sE9Y760mpXINgL3fvDN.1w--", "site_full": "btcihowtoinvest.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://btcihowtoinvest.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Is That a Bullish Reversal Pattern? – How to invest with bitcoin 2018", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Is That a Bullish Reversal Pattern?", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Is That a Bullish Reversal Pattern?", "published": "2018-05-17T06:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24bdbf192e1b0b15faf86827c86314fb72a3b4e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQK4CHUfMaTGKYn.N1K6LzdD5R9kbgSwBdPeDLUNP9zY9HgholStChRMd6xwVLdR3HjS3PyXBdkgNkE5YXqgcajA5tOthwClB0Hu10gtNB45qwsqJUCNu.sE9Y760mpXINgL3fvDN.1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcihowtoinvest", "published": "2018-05-17T06:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Is That a Bullish Reversal Pattern?", "text": "\nBitcoin failed in its last two attempts to break below the $8,000 level, creating a double bottom formation on its 1-hour chart. Price has yet to test the neckline around $8,800 and a break higher could draw more buyers in.\nThe chart pattern is around $700 tall so the resulting upside break could spur a rally of the same size. However, the 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the moving averages might also hold as dynamic resistance.\nRSI is on the move up to show that there’s still some bullish momentum left for a climb to $8,800 but the oscillator is nearing overbought conditions. This suggests that buyers could soon take a break and let sellers take over, possibly leading to another test of the bottoms.\nA recovery in risk-taking helped support cryptocurrencies in recent trading sessions as trade war fears began to ease. So far, though, there have been no industry updates that could be enough to sustain a strong rally.\nMeanwhile, the dollar remains supported by rate hike expectations as industrial production beat expectations. US building permits and housing starts dipped, but these didn’t seem to douse tightening hopes.\nIt looks like technical factors are mostly in play for bitcoin action these days as the downtrend line and rejection at another test of $9,000 has led to some profit-taking. The investigation into South Korea’s largest bitcoin exchange is also hurting sentiment as this brought back issues on regulation and security.\nTo top it off, a recently released study on the amount of energy that bitcoin mining consumes also drew some bearish pressure in.

(NYSE:TWTR) and Square Inc.(NYSE:SQ), said Wednesday at Consensus, a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in New York City. “I don’t know if it’ll be Bitcoin or not,” he said, but “I hope it will be.” Currently, Bitcoin is trading at: 8,356.9854, +163.641, or +2.00%, a s of 7:35a BST, the market is open. It is not the 1st time Mr. Dorsey had spoken fondly of digital currencies. The executive Tweeted in Y 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In Y 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family. Not everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move. “I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Mr. Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies. “This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,” Mr. Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s “Blockchain Week.” “We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.”\nGot questions on Bitcoin , Ethereum , Ripple or BitConnect?

From a high of $8,824.17 on Tuesday to a low of just $8,292.10 just after midnight on Wednesday, a 6 percent decrease. However, it is still above the $8,000 level. Bitcoin reached a high of just under $20,000 just before Xmas last year. It started to drop in price as early as last January. It is now less than half of what it was and appears unable to regain ground at present. The CoinDesk analysis Bears seem to have taken over after a minor rally last Saturday. Technical charts indicate that the price of bitcoin (BTC) may drop below the $8,000 level. There were some minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204 but there was no cut through the falling trend line hurdle. Earlier on Wednesday the price fell to a 3.5-week low of just $8,100 on Bitfinex. As the article went to press the price was $8,366 down 4.7 percent in just 24 hours. The price stayed above the $8,100 level for the rest of the day and closed at $8,340.30. The daily chart shows that the price of BTC had dipped below the 50-day moving average (MA) currently at $8,290. This indicates a resumption of the sell-off from a recent high of $9,990 and this could result in a deeper sell-off to $7,800. The inability to rise above the descending trend line and the drop to $8,100 strengthens the bearish view. This view is also supported by the fact that both the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are sloping downward. The retreat from $8,884 down to $8,100 has also established a falling top or lower highs pattern which is also a bearish sign. The relative strength index is also bearish at below 50 and trending lower. The analysis shows a high probability that the close today will be below the 50-day MA of $8,290. However, this did not happen as the close today was about fifty dollars above that level. The four-hour chart reinforces the bearish trend showing that the sell-off is continuing and could yield a drop to as low as $7,254. The major moving averages are now all sloping downwards another bearish sign. The CoinDesk prediction The article outlook is as follows: \"BTC will likely close below $8,290 (50-day MA) today and confirm a bear revival. The cryptocurrency looks set to test support at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from April 1 low to May 5 high) and could go as low as $7,524 (expanding channel breakdown target) in the next 24-48 hours. An unexpected break above $8,884 would abort the bearish view.\" The present situation The close on Wednesday was $8,340.30 above the 50-day moving average (MA) but the price never came close to the $8,884 level that would abort the bearish view. At a little over two hours into May 16 UTC the price was at $8,365.96 up about 25 dollars from the open. It remains to be seen if the price will continue to recover or drop down below the $8,000 level. So far it seems to be trading in a narrow range still close to the $8,000 level. The present price can be found here.
