The survey was a fake, and respondents were actually sending their personal details back to Grant so that he could sell them to the dark black market – the phishing scam alone netted West £180,000 or $240,000 which he then converted into Bitcoin. BBC reports that the scam cost the Just Eat company £200,000 or $265,000.\nWest also directly targeted over 100 other companies including major firms like Barclay’s, Asda, Ladbrokes, Uber, and British Airways, hacking them for more customer data to sell. His Barclay’s attacks resulted in West’s clients fraudulently removing £84,000 or $110,000 from customer accounts and costing the bank £300,000 or $400,000 to remedy through new security measures. Similarly, West cost British Airways £400,000 or $530,000 after he hacked Avios accounts.\nHe reportedly used the money to pay for a new Audi worth £40,000 or $53,000 and several trips to Las Vegas among other luxuries.\nWest was arrested in 2017 on a first-class train to London in September 2017. Detectives from the Scotland Yard cybercrime unit chose the moment to end their two-year investigation carefully, making sure Grant was logged into his computer so and grabbing his arms before he could log out of his heavily encrypted cryptocurrency wallets and dark web accounts, which otherwise would be very difficult to link to him legally.\nOn the laptop, which belonged to West’s girlfriend, police found the financial information of 100,000 people. A subsequent raid on his home revealed an SD card with the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards as well as 7 million email addresses and passwords, along with £25,000 or $33,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis, which West was also selling on the dark web.\nWest went by the username Courvoisier, after the top-shelf brandy, selling stolen information and drugs on the now-defunct site Alpha Bay. He pled guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offenses on 2 May and on Friday May 25 Judge Michael Gledhill sentenced West to 10 years and eight months in prison.\nPolice accessed and seized over £500,000 or $667,000 worth of ill-gotten Bitcoin from West’s girlfriend’s device, and she was sentenced to community service for unauthorised access of computer material – however, according to Judge Gledhill, over £1.6 million or $2.13 million worth of West’s cryptocurrency is still unaccounted for.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Reports that Bank of England is considering a bank-run cryptocurrency garnered some attention.\nBitcoin was trading at $7,123.6 by 12:05AM ET (04:05GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange, down 3.9% over the previous 24 hours. Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, plunged 8.8% at $524.8 on the Bitfinex exchange. Ripple’s XRP token fell 8.8% higher to $0.55654 on the Poloniex exchange.\nMeanwhile, Litecoin slumped 5.4% to $112.27. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday that he would consider a digital currency run by the central bank, according to reports, although Carney then added it is not currently a pressing concern.\nHis comments contradicted with Bank of England’s announcement earlier this year, in which the bank said it would not issue a central bank-run crypto. The bank expressed concern at the time that the introduction of a bank controlled virtual coin might lead to a loss of the ability to use its interest rate policy to maintain financial stability.\nCarney argued that there are upsides in utilising blockchain technology for central banking. He said it brings financial stability and could potentially save computational energy output.

Verge Coin was recently under siege and now Bitcoin Gold, a fork of Bitcoin is the latest victim to come under a 51% attack. Can this woe befall Bitcoin? - Advertisement -\nThe nightmare of every cryptocurrency is to become victim to a 51% attack. This attack is only possible in a situation whereby an entity controls 51% of the cryptocurrency's network hash rate. This gives them the power to manipulate the network as they wish. Most attackers immediately go after the money, spending a number of times the same coins they've already spent. - Advertisement -\nThis phenomenon is called double-spending.\nThe Bitcoin Gold (BTG) incident took many by surprise. For most investors, it's the first time they'll witness a 51% attack happening in the real world although they are familiar with the term and what it means.\nThe attack came at a time when cryptocurrencies are still trying to rally from huge drops experienced early in the year and crypto exchanges are getting hacked. The BTG attackers made away with millions of dollars and the team is still scrambling to put things back in control.\nThis has led many to wonder- is it possible Bitcoin fall victim to a 51% attack?\nThat possibility is very low, considering how strong the Bitcoin network is. According to Bitcoin evangelist and veteran software engineer Andreas Antonopoulos, it is very very unlikely that Bitcoin undergoes a 51% attack.\n“I don’t worry about that [51% attack on bitcoin] at all. This cannot be done with bitcoin anymore. This is something that could only be done with nascent altcoins. \"\n\"Bitcoin has achieved a level of computing that no single nation-state can overthrow it with computation alone. The effort to do so would require a massive covert operation of chip fabrication then the coordinated assault that would give them dominance over the next block for 10 minutes until we kick those bastards off the network, rework the protocol around them, they would be revealed, they would have lost a billion dollars doing this and all they got to do is one double spend.” This email address is being protected from spambots.

Altcoins Bleed", "text": "FOMO Moments The rout has continued today following a mass Ethereum selloff in a couple of hours yesterday. Markets are tumbling precipitously towards $300 billion, their lowest point since mid-April and a key support level. Failure to hold this could send all cryptos down towards their end of March yearly lows. Bitcoin has floundered again losing 3% on the day and falling to $7,150. Ethereum has also been battered and all altcoins are currently bleeding. There are no cryptocurrencies showing gains in the top 50 during the morning's Asian trading session.\nWe have to go back to the end of March to the last time every single crypto currency was bleeding. Technical analysts are warning of a bearish breakout as Bitcoin closes below a long term consolidation pattern. Ethereum has fared worse losing 6% on the day and falling to $530. There is a high probability of it falling further, below $500 which is currently a major support level.\nIn the top 25 the altcoins suffering the greatest losses at the time of writing are Bitcoin Cash down 9.5%, Tron crashing 13.5%, Nem losing 10.3%, VeChain down 10%, Bytecoin dropping 13.4%, Zcash down 12%, Icon losing 10.5% and Zilliqa shedding 12.5%. Looking at Coinmarketcap's gainers and losers for the day shows a few obscure altcoins making positive moves signaling pump and dump action.\nTotal trade volume has increased a little over the past day from $13 to $17 billion but market capitalization has fallen 6.7% as $22 billion left the crypto space in 24 hours. Bears are currently smashing the markets which look like they could be heading back to the $270 billion level the same time two months ago. Since the monthly high of $470 billion on May 6, crypto markets had hemorrhaged 35%. Bitcoin market dominance is up to around 40% as Ethereum and all altcoins take a heavy beating for the third time in 2018.\nThe post Asian Cryptocurrency Trading Roundup: Bitcoin Dominance Approaches 40% as Altcoins Bleed appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:04:03.498+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f5add5cdd8fa8a5c714f1ae87657e465a89eafe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3LVerw4TB1wVOIOQkL.k_spPe6jjSxhKtEgeKgHkp6AlzvrxrWT6vE_dTM5eRNZPcxG.OTBCn95LO8ih1sCXlAiRdJtLgwJCrH", "site_full": "alzibluk.com", "site": "alzibluk.com", "site_section": "http://alzibluk.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Al Zibluk:  Just Keeping It Real", "title": "A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin", "title_full": "A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T08:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f5add5cdd8fa8a5c714f1ae87657e465a89eafe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3LVerw4TB1wVOIOQkL.k_spPe6jjSxhKtEgeKgHkp6AlzvrxrWT6vE_dTM5eRNZPcxG.OTBCn95LO8ih1sCXlAiRdJtLgwJCrH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Zibluk", "published": "2018-05-29T08:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin", "text": "Al Zibluk Leave a comment A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin\nBitcoin's lightning network may be just starting to send transactions over the blockchain, but already its developers are looking to rearchitect the technology.\nThat's because, while touted as a way to significantly boost bitcoin's capacity, the network itself does require users to store a significant amount of data, which makes it difficult to download and run. As such, several lightning developers – Lightning Labs co-founder 'Laolu' Osuntokun and Blockstream's Christian Decker and Rusty Russell – have published a new proposal which imagines an alternative, \"simplified\" way of making off-chain transactions called eltoo.\nBut the new proposal isn't only about condensing the amount of data users need to store, it's also about keeping users' cryptocurrency safe.\nFor instance, all this data poses another problem in that if users accidentally broadcast older data, they might lose money. As such, this data has been coined \"toxic information.\"\nEltoo, on the other hand, only stores the most recent off-chain transaction data, solving the well-known \"information asymmetry\" problem – that is if something happens to the device you're running your lightning app on – say your smartphone – you might lose access to the whole history of data.\n\"With eltoo, we reduce the risk of funds being swept away. We remove this toxic information,\" said Decker, who noted that the proposal's name is a joke of sorts – the phonetic spelling of \"L2,\" which stands for layer-two, what many people call technology like lightning that pushes transactions off-chain.\nAnd this is something Decker is very interested in since he's experienced the problem personally.\n\"This actually happened to me,\" he said, adding:\n\"I had an old lightning node on my laptop. I restored it. I didn't know I didn't have the newest state. The guy closed the connection because they knew it was an old state! Because he could steal it. Which he did, by the way.\"\nAll about revoking\nDevelopers have long been trying to come up with a way for users to make a bunch of transactions using bitcoin, without bloating the blockchain with unnecessary data.\nThat's really what most of the scaling debates are all about.\nBut the first attempt to do this was way at the beginning of bitcoin's history when off-chain transaction capabilities were experimented with using so-called \"sequence numbers\" to keep track of which off-chain transaction is the most recent.\nThe idea was simple – if Alice has $10 and sends a $1 transaction to Bob, obviously her balance dwindles to $9.00. This then gets a sequence number \"1.\" If later, she sends Bob $4, her balance is now $5, and this most recent transaction gets a sequence number \"2.\"\nBut according to Decker, the mechanism \"didn't work out,\" because miners didn't have any reason to enforce the rules and replace old transactions with the more recent ones.\nMiners could just broadcast the one transaction where Alice's balance drops to $9 (even though she had made another transaction that dropped her balance to $5). While it's unclear why a miner might want or decide to not revoke a transaction for another one, they could decide to do so since there was no enforceability.\nIn this way, revoking old transactions in crucial otherwise Bob might not get the second transaction and Alice could run away with the money.\nThis \"lack of enforceability\" is a problem that wasn't solved until 2015.\nAnd the lightning network is the best-known solution to this problem so far. Today, revoking old state is accomplished with the \"L2-penalty\" model – whereby a lightning wallet or node stores all of these intermediary states, then, if someone tries to broadcast an earlier, now-invalid state, this is detected and the cheating user is punished by losing money.\nEltoo and L2\nBut, three years on, the researchers are, in fact, going back to the idea of using sequence numbers to revoke old transactions.\nUnlike bitcoin's old code, which didn't have an enforcement mechanism for these sequences, eltoo adds a procedure that makes every state update prescribed. Every state update – Alice sending Bob money, for instance – is composed of two transactions, each of which both parties store and which totally replace the prior update transaction.\n\"Only the last settlement transaction can ever be confirmed on the blockchain,\" the introductory blog post explains.\nThe tangential advantage of this system is that it increases lightning's scalability. With eltoo, each lightning node doesn't need to store all the intermediary states, rather, it stores only the most recent version and some information about the transaction itself, such as it's corresponding settlement transaction and potentially the HTLCs that spend from that settlement, the post notes.\nWhat's perhaps the most beneficial part of the proposal, though, is that it isn't built on a \"winner takes all\" model.\nInstead, eltoo and older L2 penalty schemes can be used side-by-side.\n\"Eltoo has quite different tradeoffs. I'm not implying it's better in all senses,\" Decker told CoinDesk, pointing to some arguments on the bitcoin developer mailing list about the technology increasing waiting times for transactions to be settled.\nStill, overall, he's pretty excited about eltoo and the simplicity it brings, adding:\n\"We don't know which one is nicer, but I would like eltoo as the better option. I think eltoo is easier to explain and to extend later on.\"\nCode obstacle\nNot only are developers still discussing the proposal's merits, but there's another thing standing in the technology's way –\"sighash_noinput.\"\nThis long-anticipated code option needs to be added to the bitcoin codebase for the cryptocurrency to be able to support eltoo (at least in an efficient form).\nTo understand why, it's important to know what the basic sighash function does. It works as a flag of sorts that specifies what part of the transaction data needs to be signed when it's transferred over to someone else. Users can choose from a range of options – for instance, the default flag, sighash_all, indicates that all parts of the transaction need to be signed, meaning that none of these parts can be changed throughout the process.\nThe proposed \"sighash_noinput\" function could flag that the \"input\" data going into a transaction doesn't need to be signed. And in turn, that the input data can change over time, from when the transaction was created to when it's written to the blockchain.\nAnd this is exactly what eltoo needs, since the concept is that all the state in between the beginning and final transaction will be deleted, meaning the input will be different from the start and the end.\nWhen asked whether he thinks the sighash_noinput proposal will get merged into the bitcoin codebase, Decker laughed and said, \"Ever since SegWit, I stopped making these predictions.\"\nHe's pointing to the fact that Segregated Witness (SegWit) had broad support from the bulk of bitcoin's most active developers, but ended up stirring up a years-long battle within the community. The code change was only added to bitcoin last August, even though it was proposed more than two years prior.\nStill, even though it's early, the sighash_noinput function is a relatively easy change to make to bitcoin's codebase, Decker said.\nPlus, it's been theorized for some time that the change would have many positive implications for developers, he continued. Because of these potential benefits, a handful of Twitter users have begun adding the code change to their profiles to express their support, much like Twitter users did during the scaling debate (with #No2X becoming popular among those who were opposed to the Segwit2x initiative).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian decker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eltoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusty russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laolu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockstream", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T01:20:21.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e25760cbddeb64d82c843d198e78013d99986843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.spZ4nEji1RzjJGcusZFhdYVvPG0VKbgUr5Rex8D3MP1t3lnEB2.P628qxBdHsjOCpw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide", "title_full": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide", "published": "2018-05-29T08:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e25760cbddeb64d82c843d198e78013d99986843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.spZ4nEji1RzjJGcusZFhdYVvPG0VKbgUr5Rex8D3MP1t3lnEB2.P628qxBdHsjOCpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T08:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide", "text": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide\n/u/Suberg\nsubmitted by /u/Suberg\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T08:42:55.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f36c25015c9972fd1a205887b19a99dce074070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5sREv7VYv7PmsoEt3ddM2jXSnPvSROG0VL5gYaZReV08OlQx.N2mdJQxZL9mez.xGLKBhfx88_RQuG2hAFp.ebo-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "title_full": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "published": "2018-05-29T08:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f36c25015c9972fd1a205887b19a99dce074070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5sREv7VYv7PmsoEt3ddM2jXSnPvSROG0VL5gYaZReV08OlQx.N2mdJQxZL9mez.xGLKBhfx88_RQuG2hAFp.ebo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-29T08:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:04:15.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "100f19af843fe8c496702fa976e1638a183e5592", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNMdtLtrL7OMNfoGLr3lrOEyLBx6qsL4.jrgYlJr9xRdbx0_qc7LWQWYCZyb3GYEvDeZjef.vl9_MiHiOvTB3FBVltOjaW02yJ8qUlYqNrTuCfCWgvKYLI_MdnANEXLRsyA--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC -

As more people adopt the cryptocurrency, the digital currency has exhibited cracks in its ecosystem, mainly due to the scalability issues. While the rapid growth of the community is one of the contributing factors, the major issues are said to lie with the Bitcoin Core development team and their inability to rapidly introduce scaling solutions. The conflicting views of the developers and mining community have further exacerbated the situation. \\n\nAs the Bitcoin Core community struggle to score the necessary consensus to improve the protocol, various teams have decided to take the matter into their own hands to preserve the \\u201clegacy\\u201d of Bitcoin by creating improved hard forks of Bitcoin blockchain. Advancing in this sphere is Lightning Bitcoin, a Bitcoin hard fork by the Lightning Team. The Lightning Bitcoin, LBTC, in short, is forked at Block 499,999 of the Bitcoin blockchain and adopts a more efficient Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism instead of the native Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. \\n\nWith the implementation of \\u00a0DPOS, the platform includes the best of two strong cryptocurrency networks\\u00a0 — Bitcoin and EOS. The use of DPOS, not only increases the security but with 2MB block size, it also increases the speed of transactions and optimizes smart contract support. The DPOS consensus mechanism has already been successfully implemented with BitShares and EOS platforms which has further increased the confidence in LBTC\\u2019s capabilities. \\n\nWhile the POS consensus mechanism has been hailed by many for its various obvious advantages, including the low processing power requirements and cost-efficient minting solution, it has also shown a fair share of vulnerabilities including the susceptibility to attacks and the possibility of node desynchronization with malicious intent. The Delegated Proof of Stake mechanism implemented by LBTC overcomes most of these vulnerabilities, but still being a synchronous network module exhibited potential loopholes. \\n\nTo overcome the issue, the LBTC developers have introduced DPoS consensus mechanism which can not only provide the benefits of a DPoS blockchain but also presents a Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol which can eliminate the possibility of node dissynchronization due to UTXO. By doing so, LBTC is on its way to position itself as the best cryptocurrency blockchain for not just transactions, but also dApps development. \\n\nMore information about Lightning Bitcoin is

Gaven Andresen dies off and doesnt pass on the alert/control features that Satoshi bestowed to him, would community have to legit hard fork to even stay in the realm of new development not sure how that works as Im not a dev at all, hence my question. Not sure how the BIPs are actually approved or implemented and ATM believing is all basically comes down to getting Gavins ultimate approvi. Which like I said I worry may at some point ultimately be a issue.\nAnother thing Ive wondered since getting into BTC is what happens when all BTC are mined, people hodl, and people die? Is there any contingency in place or being planned to recover stale or dead bitcoins in wallets that are OBVIOUSLY non active addresses? Or will everything that is owned by dead investors or give up investors be doomed to simply be a burn loss?...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

and is currently trading below $920 against the US Dollar. There is a short-term bearish trend line formed with resistance at $900 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may continue to move down and it could soon break the $875 support level. Bitcoin cash price is in a bearish trend below $1,000 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD could accelerate declines towards $800 as long as it is below $960.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline There were further declines noted in bitcoin cash price below the $1,000 level against the US Dollar. The price corrected a few points yesterday, but the upside move was capped by the $1,000 level. A fresh downward wave was initiated and the price settled well below the $1,000 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It even broke the $950 and $900 support levels.\nA low was formed at $872 and the price is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,000 high to $872 low. There is also a short-term bearish trend line formed with resistance at $900 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Above the trend line, the next hurdle for buyers is near the $935 level. It is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,000 high to $872 low. Moreover, there is another crucial bearish trend line with resistance at $970.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly in a major downtrend. If sellers remain in control, the price may break soon break the $875 and $850 levels. On the upside, the $960 and $970 levels are important resistances.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is near the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $850\nMajor Resistance Level – $960\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Accelerating Declines appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:02:50.231+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fb65c1648b5b84d6c6d13db7429bfecba51240e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0_gnS_FOiTE6qRkVo6dKlqe20IHIzOp8kZIinS6tY9Vvfqilcira30r3imMeIsi_A--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide", "title_full": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide", "published": "2018-05-29T08:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fb65c1648b5b84d6c6d13db7429bfecba51240e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0_gnS_FOiTE6qRkVo6dKlqe20IHIzOp8kZIinS6tY9Vvfqilcira30r3imMeIsi_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T08:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "There Are Now Over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide", "text": "The number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has surpassed the 3,000 milestone in the month of May at an accelerating pace of 6 new installations daily.\nBitcoin ATM Count Breaks 3,000 Despite the lackluster price action of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in recent months, the Bitcoin ATM industry appears as healthy as ever.\nThe latest data from CoinATMradar shows that the number of Bitcoin vending machines has passed the 3,000 milestone in mid-May and is currently at 3,125 machines worldwide.\nThis milestone comes just 15 months after surpassing the 1,000 mark back at the beginning of 2017, indicating an accelerating pace , which now stands at 6.15 installations daily.\nBack in April, Bitcoinist reported on a UK-based ATM startup, BCB ATM, whose rapid expansion is just one example of a rapidly growing market. In just eleven months through 2017, BCB ATM's machine count grew from 7 to 32 or by 528.07 percent.\nBitcoin ATM Operators Unfazed by Price Slump What's more, it appears that the Q1 2018 Bitcoin price slump has not had much of an effect on the installation rate. In fact, the last time there was a drop-off was in late-2015, when the price of Bitcoin was as low as $200 USD.\nHowever, the market has grown at an accelerating pace in the past 3 years with rising prices. From the latest data, we can assume two things with certainty: 1) the demand for buying (and selling) Bitcoin through automatic vending machines is increasing, and 2) the business model is largely profitable for the operators despite the price volatility.\nMoreover, the share of two-way machines, allowing both buying and selling, has also increased to over 35 percent with improved hardware, whose operators scoop up the fees on both sides of the trade at 8.77 percent on average per transaction.\nAt the same time, Bitcoin remains king despite an increasing number of altcoin vending options. In fact, 99.99 percent of all machines support Bitcoin, while only 50 percent of all machines support some type of altcoin(s). Litecoin is the most popular altcoin, supported by 47.8 percent of the ATMs, with Ether coming second at 28.1 percent.\nOut of the 31 total hardware manufacturers, the top three include Genesis Coin (34.37%), General Bytes (27.49%), and Lamassu (11.23%) who comprise over 70 percent of the entire market.\nAt the same time, the United States remains king of installations with over 1,800 machines, dwarfing second-place Canada, whose count stands at 477 and then Austria in third place with just 174.\nBitcoin ATMs Don't Paint the Whole Picture Of course, Bitcoin ATMs is just one facet of a much bigger industry that provides cryptocurrency buying and selling services. Indeed, the amount of physical locations where one can purchase Bitcoin , whether it's through vouchers, gift cards, web-money kiosks, etc., is much larger, numbering in the tens of thousands across the globe.\nFor example, anyone can buy Bitcoin at the 1,357 Swiss Railway ticket kiosks in Switzerland. Ukraine boasts almost 7,000 web-money kiosks that let you also buy bitcoins. While Canada's sprawling network of Flexepin cashier machines can be found at over 5,500 locations .\nAll of these services provide useful options for those who prefer not to deal with online exchanges and are looking to quickly buy or sell Bitcoin for some local cash. At the same time, the increasing pace of expansion points to a healthy industry that has adapted to the volatile market and has found its niche.\nHow important is the Bitcoin ATM industry to Bitcoin's overall adoption?

Price is also approaching the bottom of a smaller descending channel to show that the downtrend could carry on. Technical indicators on this time frame also seem to be signaling that further losses are in the cards. Bitcoin price could be gaining further bearish traction as it closed below the support of its daily symmetrical triangle.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA also held as dynamic resistance and the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum.\nRSI pulled out of the oversold region but is turning back lower to show that bears refuse to let up. Stochastic also moved back south without even reaching overbought conditions, which means that sellers are eager to stay in.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nRegulatory concerns and the selling of Mt. Gox bitcoin are two of the main factors being blamed for the recent slide in bitcoin price. There have been no other big industry updates lately, so it's understandable that most investors are being spooked by the drop.\nTo top it off, risk appetite has been notably weaker on account of geopolitical risks in U.S. and in Europe. In particular, Spain and Italy are likely to undergo elections for its top leadership positions, and the uncertainty is weighing on the appetite for riskier assets and driving traders towards safe-havens like the dollar.\nThe US has the NFP report lined up later this week and stronger tightening expectations from the results could further boost the US dollar. On the other hand, a return in risk-taking on weak data and slower tightening expectations could lead to some profit-taking and a much needed BTC/USD bounce.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Heads Up for this Bearish Breakout! appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T08:09:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e601a92149277004d425fd733c51ceac51c0da14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnY6b4TKk86rhek40Cmwk2we_EN4qk9CF1kw_DdS1c1ewT2fskvr2b5g--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Bitcoin Bears In Charge Could Spur Rally.", "title_full": "Bitcoin Bears In Charge Could Spur Rally.", "published": "2018-05-29T08:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e601a92149277004d425fd733c51ceac51c0da14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnY6b4TKk86rhek40Cmwk2we_EN4qk9CF1kw_DdS1c1ewT2fskvr2b5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T08:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Bears In Charge Could Spur Rally.", "text": " Bitcoin Bears In Charge Could Spur Rally.\nHarden, though, was in no mood for the gesture.

With an area of just 316 km2, Malta is one of the world’s most densely-populated countries. Malta is part of the eurozone and uses Euros (EUR) as their currency.\nThe country’s economy is historically based in port trading. However, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has successfully attracted aircraft and ship registration, credit-card issuing banking licences, fund administration, and gaming businesses.\nThere’s a bright outlook for cryptocurrencies in Malta. Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, has recently announced that it will relocate its headquarters to Malta . Additionally, obtaining residency in Malta is fairly easy due to its Global Residence Programme . Maltese Taxes on Bitcoin\nNoMoreTax.eu describes Malta as the EU’s crypto leader due to its favourable and detailed legislation.\nMalta is one of the few EU countries which does not impose a property tax. Business taxes for “global residents” are 35%.\nAccording to No More Tax, foreign residents aren’t subject to Maltese income tax on income generated outside Malta, provided it’s not remitted to a Maltese bank account. If brought into Malta, this income is taxed at 15% according to Chetcuti Cauchi Advocates (March 2017), a legal firm based in Malta.\nAdditionally, foreigners resident in Malta aren’t subject to income tax on any foreign sourced capital gains, even when they remit these gains to a Maltese bank account. This includes profit made in stock markets and so should extend to crypto gains too, at least until such time as specific laws are passed.\nFinance Malta, a quasi-governmental info site, reports that Malta does not yet have laws in place for the taxation of cryptocurrency. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nIn February of 2018, the Maltese government created the new Malta Digital Innovation Authority , which provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto businesses. The MDIA seeks to certify blockchain platforms used by companies. It will also improve the verification processes for crypto platform users.\nMalta’s Prime Minister has welcomed Bitcoin and blockchain tech, explicitly mentioning Malta’s aim to become “global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses and the jurisdiction of quality and choice for world class fintech companies.”\nAs of January 2018, the Maltese Financial Services Authority is making plans to enable regulated investment into cryptocurrencies and ICOs.\nA Maltese economic minister recently announced (April 2018) that Malta wishes to become known as “The Blockchain Island.”\nFinance Malta reports that Malta’s Prime Minister said in the European Parliament that EU governments should double down on blockchain technology. The PM also said that “the rise of cryptocurrencies can be slowed but cannot be stopped.” How Malta’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nAs of November 2017, Malta’s oldest bank, the Bank of Valletta (BOV) has suspended cryptocurrency transactions . The government has stated that these delays with the banking sector will resolve themselves once official legislation is in place. #2 – Bermuda\nBermuda is a small Caribbean island with a population of around 65,000. It’s a former British colony and remains a part of the Commonwealth. As currency, it uses the Bermudian Dollar, which is pegged to the US Dollar. Indeed, USD is frequently used in Bermuda.\nA lot of financial companies operate from Bermuda, especially in the insurance sector, and there are 4 major banks situated there. Bermuda reportedly has the highest GDP per capita in the world, as its favourable tax rates and island lifestyle attract high net worth individuals and major corporations.\nBermuda is renowned as a tax haven. It has no VAT, nor any corporate, income, wealth or capital gains taxes. Bermuda has only a minimal payroll tax , which is around 10% on the high end, as well high consumption taxes on goods and services. There are also high duties levied on all imports. Bermuda’s capital tops the cost of living index.\nGoogle is one of the more famous companies to take advantage of Bermudan tax law. Google sent over $10 billion to its Bermudan subsidiary. This allocation allowed the company to avoid $2 billion in taxes in 2011.\nThere are more than 15,000 companies registered in Bermuda which have no physical presence or employees there. Bermudan Taxes on Bitcoin\nBermuda’s light taxation policies extend to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Bitcoin is not recognised as legal tender in Bermuda, which explains its tax-free status. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nThe government of Bermuda’s website carries a formal statement from the Minister of Finance on the Government’s Cryptocurrency Initiative, issued in November of 2017. The gist is that the country seeks to attract crypto business but is putting in place regulation to prevent criminality.\nFollowing an investigation into cryptocurrency launched in November 2017, Bermuda’s financial regulator, the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), published a paper in April of 2018 regarding its proposed “regulation of virtual currency business.” This paper is known as the Virtual Currency Business Act (VCBA).\nBermuda aims to implement anti-money laundering (AML) standards and provide a reasonable, friendly framework for cryptocurrency businesses and startups. The rules aren’t prohibitive but intended to foster a safe and predictable operating environment.\nICOs will receive special attention, requiring explicit approval from the Minister of Finance before being allowed to operate in Bermuda. Recording customer identity info (KYC measures) will be mandatory for ICOs.\nThe largest crypto business with ties to Bermuda is Binance , currently the leading crypto exchange by volume. The CEO and founder of Binance signed a memorandum of understanding with Bermuda’s Minister of Finance in April of 2018. Binance has so far invested $15 million into the island nation. How Bermuda’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nBanks in Bermuda may be reasonably expected to accommodate the government’s new regulations and welcoming attitude towards cryptocurrency. #3 – Switzerland\nSwitzerland is a prosperous country in central Europe, synonymous with political neutrality and banking privacy (although this has been degraded of late). Switzerland is not part of the eurozone, having kept the Swiss Franc (CHF) as its currency. The country is ranked first in the world for economic productivity and competitiveness and has an extremely high standard of living.\nSeveral major crypto businesses, such as Shapeshift and Xapo , have set up in the Swiss town of Zug. This region, nicknamed “Crypto Valley,” has passed some very progressive laws regarding crypto and related businesses, even approving Bitcoin as payment for utility bills. Other Swiss regions are following suit, such as Chiasso . The Swiss state railway company even accepts Bitcoin for ticket payments nationwide. Swiss Taxes on Bitcoin\nThe cantons of Zug and Lucerne have detailed their approaches to Bitcoin taxation in German-language papers dating from Q4 2017.\nSwiss law firm, Vischer, wrote an excellent overview (December 2017) of the Bitcoin taxation situation in Switzerland, as did the GoldenVisa site.\nCrypto holdings must be declared and are subject to wealth taxes. They are to be valued according to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration’s year-end average prices, if available. Otherwise, they are valued according to purchase price.\nCapital gains taxes and offsets for losses only apply on those who trade crypto professionally.\nCrypto earned as a salary is subject to income tax, even for self-employed persons. Mining profits are also subject to income tax.\nSwitzerland is an “unofficial” cryptocurrency tax haven, according to an expert’s view published (February 2018) on CoinTelegraph. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nThe Swiss economic minister proclaimed (January 2018) Switzerland’s intention to become a major crypto-nation before journalists at a private conference on cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin businesses, Switzerland may be able to recapture its reputation for financial privacy.\nAn article (February 2018) published on RT.com characterized Switzerland as embracing Bitcoin, altcoins and ICOs while most of the rest of the world is cracking down on them.\nICOs will be regarded as securities within Switzerland, according to regulatory guidelines passed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in February 2018.\nAlthough no license is required to send or receive Bitcoin, companies must comply with Swiss anti-money laundering (AML) legislation, according to an article published February 2018. How Switzerland’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nSwitzerland’s Vontobel bank has offered Bitcoin “mini futures” on the Swiss stock exchange since November 2017.\nFalcon Private Bank, a boutique investment firm, has been buying and storing Bitcoin on behalf of its high net worth clients since July 2017.\nBoth Vontobel and Falcon have stated (December 2017) that “cryptocurrency’s best days are ahead of it.”\nSwiss online bank, Swissquote, launched a financial product in December of 2017 which allows users to allocate holdings between Bitcoin and USD.\n#4 – Gibraltar\nGibraltar is a tiny country located south of Spain. It is home to a mere ~33,000 people. While self-governing, Gibraltar is part of the territory of the United Kingdom. British and Gibraltar pounds are the legal tender there, although euros see frequent informal use.\nOnline gambling and financial services and are two of Gibraltar’s leading industries. Many banks, brokerages, investment and insurance firms are headquartered in Gibraltar. Blockchain-based companies, including many ICOs, have also been drawn to the territory as an attractive spot for doing business. Gibraltar Taxes on Bitcoin\nGibraltar’s corporate tax rate has been fixed at 10% since 2011.\nGibraltar is in the process of formulating a legal framework for cryptocurrency businesses (Q1 2018), which should bring further clarity on taxation issues. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nGibraltar formulated the Distributed Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework rules in January 2018, granting formal license to crypto companies in the region.\nWith the DLT Regulatory Framework, Gibraltar’s Financial Services Commission became the first financial ombudsman in Europe to draw up regulations governing ICOs . As ICOs exist in a legal grey area in most nations – except for those in which they’re banned – these rules are likely to attract many ICOs to the jurisdiction.\nAs part of Brexit, Gibraltar is set to leave the European Union in 2019. This may impact banking and legal relationships between Gibraltar and the rest of Europe. How Gibraltar’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nOn the 25th of July 2016, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange announced an Exchange Traded Instrument (ETI) based on Bitcoin, called BitcoinETI . This is the first such instrument of its kind in Europe and signifies that the financial sector in Gibraltar is fully onboard with cryptocurrency.\nWhile the Gibraltar International Bank is very accepting of crypto, its British partner bank is not. In January of 2018, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) refused to process orders from crypto firms based in Gibraltar. This surprise move left many Gibraltar-based crypto businesses scrambling. What this incident highlights is the vulnerability of Gibraltar to British business decisions or even regulations.\n#5 – Slovenia\nSlovenia is a central European nation with a population of around 2 million and a strong, advanced economy. It is the richest Slavic nation, as measured by per capita GDP. As a eurozone member, Slovenia uses the Euro. The economy is mostly service-based and quality of life there is rated 14th in the world.\nMajor international exchange, Bitstamp , was founded in Slovenia in 2011. Slovenia has considerable hydroelectric power and the well-known cloud mining service, NiceHash, operates from there. Similar to Estonia, Finland and Lithuania, Slovenia’s government is very welcoming towards cryptocurrency. Slovenian Taxes on Bitcoin\nThe Ministry of Finance of Slovenia has published a document on cryptocurrency in late 2013, although unfortunately it’s not available in English.\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are classified as virtual currencies according an article (published 2017 or later). This means Slovenia does not tax Bitcoin as either money or a security.\nIndividuals who are taxed on crypto profits under income tax laws, based on the crypto’s value at the time of acquisition. However, Bitcoin trading is not taxed under these income tax laws.\nIndividuals who acquire Bitcoin as part of their business or mining activities will pay income tax on it.\nBitcoin and crypto are exempt from capital gains tax and mining is VAT-exempt.\nThe corporate tax rate on crypto business in Slovenia is not well-defined but taxation should certainly be expected. The Financial Administration of Slovenia has said that “the accounting treatment depends… on the circumstances.” Capital gains taxes of 19% may be levied on profits. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nThe Slovenian town of Kranj inaugurated what is perhaps the world’s first public monument to Bitcoin in March of 2018. This symbolizes the Slovenian government’s acceptance of cryptocurrency.\nSlovenia’s Prime Minister promoted the country as being friendly to blockchain in October of 2017. He praised crypto startups in the nation and revealed that the government is investigating the application of blockchain technology for its own purpose. The PM went on to say that government “want[s]to position Slovenia as the most recognised blockchain destination in the European Union.”\nThe PM and Economic and Technology Minister re-affirmed the nation’s commitment to blockchain technology during a meeting between government and industry players, held in February of 2018.\nSlovenian crypto businesses are cooperating with each other and regulators under the Blockchain Alliance CEE . How Slovenia’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nIn September 2017, Slovenia’s LON bank became the first regulated bank in the world to sell Bitcoin (indirectly, via the issuance of coupons) from its 15 nationwide ATMs . The bank reported sales of half a million euro achieved in less than four months.\nUnfortunately, LON’s ground breaking approach to Bitcoin was halted in February of 2018 by the Slovenian Central Bank. The ban came one day after the central bank warned about the risks of cryptocurrency, saying that it could undermine financial stability if it continued to expand.\nAccording to NoMoreTax.eu, businesses in the country must have a regulated bank account and may not operate solely in cryptocurrency. #6 – Singapore\nSingapore is a Southeast Asian island nation of 5.6 million people. The country’s has a highly developed market economy, with historic roots as a trading port. The country uses Singaporean dollars (SGD) as its currency. It is known as a tax haven and a global financial centre. Singapore was rated the world’s most “technology-ready” nation.\nThe Singaporean economy has been rated as the most innovative, freest, most dynamic, most competitive and most business-friendly in the world. It is rated as having the 3rd highest per capita income in the world. Singapore is also seen as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. Singaporean Taxes on Bitcoin\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has decided that Bitcoins are to be viewed as goods and not as currency.\nAny company dealing with Bitcoin is required to pay GST (Goods and Services Tax) when trading Bitcoin or using it for purchases. This tax is currently set at 7%.\nTech in Asia reported in January of 2014 that Singapore will not apply taxation to online gaming worlds, which possibly includes online gambling.\nCompanies buying or selling Bitcoin to or from clients will be liable for GST on the amounts trades as well as their commission fees.\nCapital gains tax apparently does not imply to long-term investments into Bitcoin. Indeed, Singapore currently has no capital gains tax system in place. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nIn February of 2018, the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Minister of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) answered parliamentary questions surrounding the banning of trading in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe Deputy PM highlighted that cryptocurrencies are experimental, are host to many illicit transactions and present a great risk to consumers. He also said that the MAS is closely monitoring cryptocurrencies and seeks to warn consumers of their risks.\nMAS is also looking to bring Bitcoin under singular regulation in combination with other monetary services.\nHowever, the Deputy PM also stated that there is no foreseeable reason to ban Bitcoin at this stage, and that Singapore can tolerate the use of cryptocurrencies. How Singapore’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nIn November of 2017 Singapore’s largest, state-owned bank, DBS accused Bitcoin of being a “Ponzi scheme.” This contrasts with the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s more neutral stance on Bitcoin.\nBitcoin businesses were in a tough spot in September of 2017, when Singaporean banks closed several cryptocurrency businesses’ bank accounts . For example, CoinHako, a cryptocurrency-related firm, had its bank accounts close by DBS.\nWhile DBS was clearly hostile to Bitcoin, Moon Banking reports many banks in Singapore which are crypto-friendly. However, there are only a few votes in most cases. Recent votes suggest that DBS has become more open to Bitcoin. #7 – Estonia\nEstonia is a Northern European country and a member of the eurozone. It has a small population of 1.3 million people. Estonia is technologically advanced, being the birthplace of the popular Skype service. The country is generally prosperous and rated highly for economic freedom (4th in Europe) and ease of doing business (12th in the world).\nThe country is also notable as a leader in e-government, having implemented internet voting in 2005. Estonia is even contemplating the launch of its own national cryptocurrency, Estcoin . Estonian Taxes on Bitcoin\nA possibly-outdated summary (Q2 2014) of Estonian laws on Bitcoin taxation reveals that Estonia classifies Bitcoin in much the same way as the ECB. Bitcoin is seen as an alternative currency, but not as a security. People or companies conducting Bitcoin transactions must be registered as providers of business services.\nAccording to an article (Q4 2017) by the founder of Incorporate.ee, Bitcoin profits are subject to capital gains tax (of around 25%), but exempt from VAT (20%).\nThe ECJ, the European Union’s highest court, ruled in October of 2015 that Bitcoin transactions are exempt from VAT. The court sees Bitcoin as currency rather than property (the latter being subject to VAT).\nA fairly recent (Q2 2017) article by a Bitcoin trader decries Estonia’s 25% capital gains tax and its 33% social tax . Such rates may not apply in all cases – a trader based in Estonia reports (Q1 2018) paying only 20% income tax.\nProspective businesses should conduct their own investigation into the rate their particular business would be charged, as it’s likely to be considerably lower than this stated maximum. A good place to start would be the Estonian Tax and Customs Board and this guide regarding the taxation of cryptocurrency transactions in Estonia.\nNote that “e-residents” (described below) are only taxed on income derived in Estonia. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nEstonia’s pioneering e-residency scheme makes it easy for foreign nationals to establish a legal and banking presence in the country – and by extension, Europe. Combined with the nation’s positive attitude towards cryptocurrency, this makes it a great point of entry into the European market.\nE-residency is not equivalent to tax residency, nor does it work for purposes of registering with crypto exchanges.\nThe government has a welcoming stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. Estonia is considered the easiest Baltic nation in which to open a Bitcoin business. A recent (Q1 2018) forum thread , regarding the founding a crypto-related business in Estonia by e-resident “foreigners,” outlines the order in which to proceed. While the process appears easy and inexpensive, note that it’s necessary to secure specific licenses for the legal operation of any crypto-related business. This demonstrates that regulatory clarity on crypto certainly exists within Estonia.\nThe Estonian government is still considering launching Estcoin, despite criticism (Q3 2017) of the project by the European Central Bank. This shows that Estonia exercises at least some degree of independence in promoting cryptocurrency, even if the ECB opposes cryptocurrency in order to protect its fiat monopoly. The Estonian government is even contemplating a sovereign wealth fund (Q3 2017) based on Bitcoin.\nThe cost of opening a Bitcoin business in Estonia is low, reportedly (Q4 2017) around 8,000 euros. How Estonia’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nEstonia’s LHV Bank stated (Q1 2016) that it’s interested in blockchain tech and supports Bitcoin’s values. The bank has issued a blockchain-based wallet for Euro tokens and even trains its employees in cryptocurrency. LHV is also partnered with Coinbase and the UK’s Coinfloor exchange, so it’s probably the best choice for an Estonian bank.\n#8 – Georgia\nGeorgia the country (not to be confused with the US state) is an Eastern European nation of close to 4 million people. It is not a eurozone member and uses the Georgian Iari (GEL) as currency. For purposes of attracting foreign investment into its IT industry, Georgia set up the Poti free industrial zone near its capital, Tblisi, in 2015.\nThe post-Soviet Georgian economy is one of the quickest-growing in Eastern Europe, thanks to economic reforms and modernisation. In 2017, Georgia was ranked 14th in the world for ease of doing business and 13th for economic freedom. However, in 2016 Georgia was rated poorly among European nations for the development of its IT sector (although this is steadily improving).\nGoergia has the 2nd highest Bitcoin mining hashrate in the world after China, according to the Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study , published in 2017. This is largely due to the presence of a Bitfury mining facility near Tblisi. Georgian Taxes on Bitcoin\nTaxes in Georgia are comparatively low, as described by the Company Formation Georgia website.\nOnly income generated from Georgia sources is taxed.\nCompanies situated in the Poti free industrial zone benefit from a preferential taxation scheme . Within this zone, there is no VAT, dividend, profit or property tax. Tax on leases and salaries will still apply. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nIn February 2017, Georgia’s government approved a system whereby state property transactions will be recorded via the Bitcoin network. This will be developed in cooperation with Bitfury.\nIn April of 2016, Bitfury and the Georgian government launched a blockchain-based land registry project.\nThe government is welcoming of crypto-related investment and has close ties with large Bitcoin miner, Bitfury.\nCryptocurrency is not seen as legal tender in Georgia.\nThe co-founder of Georgia-based crypto business, Spotcoin, stated in May of 2018 that he believes it likely that the Georgian government will soon investigate cryptocurrency regulation. How Georgia’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nThe National Bank of Georgia issued a warning regarding the volatility of cryptocurrency in December of 2017. However, no regulatory action was taken.\n#9 – Belarus\nBelarus is an Eastern European nation of nearly 10 million people. The country’s economy is mostly manufacturing-based and uses Byelorussian rubles (BYR) as currency. The government has recently embraced cryptocurrency as part of its program to develop the IT sector and attract foreign businesses, investment and talent.\nThe Digital Economy Development Ordinance , signed by President Lukashenko in December 2017, lays out the country’s plans in detail. Note that these new rules governing crypto – perhaps the most progressive in the world – apply only to individuals or companies which are registered residents of the Hi-Tech Park. This is a special economic zone located in the capital city of Minsk.\nWhile Western media is discernibly negative in its coverage of Belarus, perhaps due to the country’s close association with Russia, Belarus presents an interesting opportunity for the right type of Bitcoin business. Belarusian Taxes on Bitcoin\nUnder the Ordinance, Belarus has waived all taxes on cryptocurrency transactions and income for five years (so until January of 2023). In other words, no taxation of mining, trading, or other business activities involving crypto. Bitcoin gifts and inheritances are also exempt from tax.\nTax-free status applies also to business conducted with foreign countries.\nThe Ministry of Finance in Minsk has created new accounting rules which specifically address cryptocurrency. This brings some much-needed clarity to tax reporting. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nThe President of Belarus has put his name to a decree which fully legalizes blockchain technology within the country. All crypto-related business activities, including ICOs, exchanges, mining, smart contracts, etc. are now considered legal in the country.\nNote that cryptocurrency is not regarded as legal tender in Belarus, meaning there is no compulsion for any person or business to accept it in lieu of Byelorussian rubles.\nForeign companies may take advantage of Belarus’s favourable policies by registering a company there, according to an article from January 2018).\nForeign IT specialists may stay in Belarus without a Visa for 180 days. How Belarus’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nGiven the legislation passed at the highest levels, banks in the country have no real choice but to fall in line.\nIn July of 2017, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus gave local banks the green light to use blockchain systems for “ transmitting bank guarantees .” This appears to refer to a permissioned blockchain to record credit agreements between banks and the state.\nThe central bank has also revealed plans to apply blockchain technology in the management of Belarusian currency and stock exchanges. #10 – Hong Kong\nHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, located along its southern coast. Despite being a small territory, Hong Kong has a population over 7 million and a strong economy, largely based in finance and trade. Its economy, ranked the 44th biggest globally, has also been rated as the freest in the world since 1995 (although increasing Chinese influence may alter this in future).\nHong Kong has its own currency, the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), which has a lot of trading volume. Hong Kong has lighter regulations than China and English is more commonly spoken there than in China, due to Hong Kong’s history as a British colony. Hong Kong’s Taxes on Bitcoin\nBitcoin is exempt from both VAT and capital gains taxes in Hong Kong. However, income tax will still apply whether a business is receiving HKD or BTC. Reporting may be conducted in either currency. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nThe Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong described (February 2018) the region as having reliable, predictable and hands-off regulations. Regulations are said to be simple and clear. The group gives a good overview of the evolution of Hong Kong’s Bitcoin regulations over the years.\nBitcoin is categorized as a virtual commodity rather than a currency. According to the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, this means it’s unregulated by existing financial watchdogs. The Association says that Bitcoin trading is not regulated by any of the organisations which oversee commodities trading either. Hong Kong’s legal status as a “free port” means that legislation of commerce is generally light.\nIn April of 2018, the Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury agency published a report on money laundering and terrorist financing, which considered the role of Bitcoin and other cryptos in such activities. It was concluded that crypto had no “visible impact” in these areas.\nAs an example of Chinese influence leading to stricter regulation, the South China Morning Post reported in February 2018 that lawmakers and brokers have called on Hong Kong’s government to pass stricter regulations on Bitcoin. This comes in the wake of China’s bans on cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO activity, as well as tightening restrictions in Germany and the USA. How Hong Kong’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nBanks in Hong Kong do not seem as friendly to Bitcoin as the government there. Hang Seng Bank closed the account of large crypto exchange, Gatecoin, in September of 2017 without warning. Gatecoin claims to have made every effort at anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Several other crypto startups also had their accounts frozen.\nHSBC (Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank), one of the world’s largest banks which was founded in Hong Kong but is now headquartered in London, stated that it has “limited appetite” for crypto exchanges but welcomes start-ups.\nThe central bank of Hong Kong, known as the Monetary Authority, said that the rejection rate for new business accounts is only 5%. #11 – Japan\nJapan is no laggard when it comes to Bitcoin. The world’s first major Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, was based in Tokyo. The inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakomoto, even had a Japanese pseudonym.\nJapan is certainly one of the nations at the forefront of Bitcoin adoption, legalization and integration. For example, Japan was the first country in the world to (arguably) approve Bitcoin as legal tender. The nation was also first to pass broad regulation of its 32+ cryptocurrency exchanges, aimed at improving their security.\nWhile Japan is often reported (Q1 2018) as the world leader in crypto trading volumes, it must be borne in mind that many of their exchanges offer zero fee trading, which can greatly inflate volumes (as seen with Chinese Bitcoin volume) , before and after their government’s imposition of mandatory trading fees). Japanese Taxes on Bitcoin\nIn December of 2017, Japan’s National Tax Agency released guidance on the tax treatment of crypto profits. Essentially, anyone earning above 20m JPY (roughly $184k USD) annually or making profit in excess of 200k JPY ($1,840 USD) will be eligible for tax. Such profits are classed as miscellaneous income. Holders are not taxed, only those taking profits from selling coins or using them for purchase of goods and services.\nJapan has a 7-tiered system of taxation. Tax rates range between 5 and 45 percent, based on annual earnings. There is also a residential tax on all income of 10 percent, for a maximum tax rate of 55 percent.\nBusiness losses may not be used to offset crypto profits, nor may crypto losses be used to offset other gains.\nConsumption tax was removed from Bitcoin in April of 2017, when it was declared legal tender. Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nJapan’s Cabinet officially recognised Bitcoin as “real money” in Q1 2016.\nBitcoin is seen as legal in Japan and their regulation is not so strict as to stifle Bitcoin’s growth there.\nJapan’s Virtual Currency Act went into effect on the 1st of April 2017. It mostly governs the capital requirements and security processes of exchanges.\nThe Nomura Research Institute issued a report on blockchain tech in May 2016. It suggests that further changes to the country’s banking laws are required to properly deal with cryptocurrencies, specifically the Banking Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.\nThe Accounting Standards Board of Japan is reportedly (Q1 2017) working on a framework for the treatment of cryptocurrency. How Japan’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nThe largest bank in Japan, MUFG (Mitsubishi UFJ), is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency exchange, its own coin and segregated Bitcoin accounts for clients of other Japanese exchanges. This is according to news coverage from January 2018.\nJapan’s largest crypto exchange, bitFlyer, received investment capital in early 2017 or late 2016 from all three of Japan’s largest banking corporations; Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho Banking Corporation. #12 – Germany\nWith a population of nearly 83 million, Germany is often considered the leading European country in terms of its technological, industrial and economic might. The country is the world’s third largest exporter of goods and has a vibrant economy, with a highly skilled labour force and a large capital stock.\nThe country seems to have a love-hate relationship with Bitcoin. While accepting it as a valid currency, the government still seeks to impose further regulations on cryptocurrency, advancing this as a topic for discussion at the G20 summit held in early 2018. It is yet to be seen if Berlin, labelled by The Guardian in 2013 as the “Bitcoin Capital of Europe,” can retain this glowing reputation in the face of serious competition from other European cities. German Taxes on Bitcoin\nAs Bitcoin is seen as a legitimate currency in Germany, the country has announced that no tax will be charged for transactions.\nNo More Tax EU stated (in 2017 or later) that if you hold Bitcoin or other altcoins for one year or longer, you will pay no capital gains tax when selling them. This is a law seemingly designed to encourage hodling! Government Stance on Bitcoin Businesses\nIn 2018, Germany’s finance ministry officially classified Bitcoin as a “unit of account.” Bitcoin had long been accepted in Germany as “private money.” This new classification means that Bitcoin may be considered as currency for purposes of taxation and trading.\nBitcoin was approved as an acceptable means of payment in March of 2018 by Germany’s National Tourist Board. How Germany’s Banking Sector views Bitcoin\nAt the recent G20 summit in February of 2018, Germany’s economic chiefs and senior central bankers sided with France in calling for serious investigation and greater regulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, during the course of the summit, it was decided that no further regulation was to be implemented.\nIn April of 2018, Deutsche Bank called for a serious regulatory crackdown on – and even a halt to – cryptocurrencies. They claim that currencies like Bitcoin only lead to greater financial fraud and cybercrime.\nIn April of 2018, German securities bank, Wertpapierhandels Bank, launched a cryptocurrency trading service , in partnership with Solaris Bank. At this stage, the service is only open to their professional customers.\nA promising new German online banking service named Bitbond uses Bitcoin as the platform for international peer to peer lending.\nMoon Banking reports that Bayrische Landesbank, Commerzbank, Fidor, GLS Bank, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, N26, Norddeutsche Landesbank, and Sparkasse are all crypto-friendly banks. Deutsche Bank was seen as unfriendly towards crypto.

money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation—in bitcoin.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s … accepted by a group of people …. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters .\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were “a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction”.\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n“It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it’s mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.”\nAnd that’s where the havoc begins.\n“People dive in because they don’t want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.”\nIn that regard, it wasn’t surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n“I think it’s an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That’s what a compulsive gambler wants.”\nmedia_camera A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n“It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It’s a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.”\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n“It’s relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don’t know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it’s relatively easy.”\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n“A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don’t want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.”\nThe situation “just goes bad” from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n“They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don’t realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.”\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem.

For me it's still better to start your own business than depend your future in bitcoin investment.\nWhat do you think guys?\n I agree with you. Investing in bitcoin is really profitable and the best but still you need to invest also in other form of business because bitcoin is volatile.

As an investment opportunity, it was seen as one of the largest gold mines in 2017. Still, many questions remain, namely in terms of risks, as Bitcoin becomes increasingly mainstream. Answering these questions is extremely important for all cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin is the clear pioneer and frontrunner of blockchain technology.\nThis is what we would like to address in this article, looking at three major risk factors that Bitcoin will have to face down in 2018. For those interested in more information, they can check out ExpressVPN’s Bitcoin: Ultimate Security & Privacy ebook .\nHacking & Theft\nBitcoin hacks have received worldwide attention from small-time criminals hacking computers to possibly rogue government-backed attacks on major exchanges. It took the industry years to develop sound practices and properly take security into account because of the difficulties involved. This is because unlike traditional financial networks which can rely on trusted custodians, Bitcoin relies upon blockchain encryption. This basically means users can only rely on themselves to secure their assets through the use of wallet technology. Backups can further enhance this security.\nRegulatory Risks\nHowever, risks facing Bitcoin are not exclusively technical or criminal in nature. When exchanging Bitcoin or investing speculatively, physical security aspects and compliance issues may need to be taken into account. For example, lost of Bitcoin stored in hardware is a definite possibility that was played for laughs by American sitcom Big Bang Theory in November 2017, but is actually a serious issue. Furthermore, regulatory changes and restrictions may also impact Bitcoin prices, with trade requiring counterparty and regulatory risk assessment for it to be truly safe.\nSystematic Collapse\nLastly, as Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) are a new financial product, and one that lacks the backing of any trusted institutions, there is a risk of systematic collapse. With its value based upon trust and provided by the masses, one must have to consider the possibility, however remote, of Bitcoin collapsing on its own. It is also possible for governments, banks, or major institutions to simply flood the Bitcoin market with miners, forcing others out of business.\nFor answers to these risks and more, remember to check out Bitcoin: Ultimate Security & Privacy .\n3 Risks Facing Bitcoin in 2018 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T00:10:37.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1545c746018bf2b8b732367111632e2a92802177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFSgZ3K1gO6IqOsvDG6POvMQi1_sYTNx7mjUETpLhJY.Oh.UXD1D8JwJ4AWZtrDCPacZ7vLUKFJB3zH5LLl._OTQ", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin", "title_full": "A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T07:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1545c746018bf2b8b732367111632e2a92802177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFSgZ3K1gO6IqOsvDG6POvMQi1_sYTNx7mjUETpLhJY.Oh.UXD1D8JwJ4AWZtrDCPacZ7vLUKFJB3zH5LLl._OTQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-29T07:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 2 mins ago\nBitcoin’s lightning network may be just starting to send transactions over the blockchain, but already its developers are looking to rearchitect the technology.

As such, several lightning developers – Lightning Labs co-founder 'Laolu' Osuntokun and Blockstream's Christian Decker and Rusty Russell – have published a new proposal which imagines an alternative, \"simplified\" way of making off-chain transactions called eltoo .\nBut the new proposal isn't only about condensing the amount of data users need to store, it's also about keeping users' cryptocurrency safe.\nFor instance, all this data poses another problem in that if users accidentally broadcast older data, they might lose money. As such, this data has been coined \"toxic information.\"\nEltoo, on the other hand, only stores the most recent off-chain transaction data, solving the well-known \"information asymmetry\" problem – that is if something happens to the device you're running your lightning app on - say your smartphone - you might lose access to the whole history of data.\n\"With eltoo, we reduce the risk of funds being swept away. We remove this toxic information,\" said Decker, who noted that the proposal's name is a joke of sorts – the phonetic spelling of \"L2,\" which stands for layer-two, what many people call technology like lightning that pushes transactions off-chain.\nAnd this is something Decker is very interested in since he's experienced the problem personally.\n\"This actually happened to me,\" he said, adding:\n\"I had an old lightning node on my laptop. I restored it. I didn't know I didn't have the newest state. The guy closed the connection because they knew it was an old state! Because he could steal it. Which he did, by the way.\" All about revoking\nDevelopers have long been trying to come up with a way for users to make a bunch of transactions using bitcoin, without bloating the blockchain with unnecessary data.\nThat's really what most of the scaling debates are all about.\nBut the first attempt to do this was way at the beginning of bitcoin's history when off-chain transaction capabilities were experimented with using so-called \"sequence numbers\" to keep track of which off-chain transaction is the most recent.\nThe idea was simple – if Alice has $10 and sends a $1 transaction to Bob, obviously her balance dwindles to $9.00. This then gets a sequence number \"1.\" If later, she sends Bob $4, her balance is now $5, and this most recent transaction gets a sequence number \"2.\"\nBut according to Decker, the mechanism \"didn't work out,\" because miners didn't have any reason to enforce the rules and replace old transactions with the more recent ones.\nMiners could just broadcast the one transaction where Alice's balance drops to $9 (even though she had made another transaction that dropped her balance to $5). While it's unclear why a miner might want or decide to not revoke a transaction for another one, they could decide to do so since there was no enforceability.\nIn this way, revoking old transactions in crucial otherwise Bob might not get the second transaction and Alice could run away with the money.\nThis \"lack of enforceability\" is a problem that wasn't solved until 2015.\nAnd the lightning network is the best-known solution to this problem so far. Today, revoking old state is accomplished with the \"L2-penalty\" model – whereby a lightning wallet or node stores all of these intermediary states, then, if someone tries to broadcast an earlier, now-invalid state, this is detected and the cheating user is punished by losing money. Eltoo and L2\nBut, three years on, the researchers are, in fact, going back to the idea of using sequence numbers to revoke old transactions.\nUnlike bitcoin's old code, which didn't have an enforcement mechanism for these sequences, eltoo adds a procedure that makes every state update prescribed. Every state update – Alice sending Bob money, for instance – is composed of two transactions, each of which both parties store and which totally replace the prior update transaction.\n\"Only the last settlement transaction can ever be confirmed on the blockchain,\" the introductory blog post explains.\nThe tangential advantage of this system is that it increases lightning's scalability. With eltoo, each lightning node doesn't need to store all the intermediary states, rather, it stores only the most recent version and some information about the transaction itself, such as it's corresponding settlement transaction and potentially the HTLCs that spend from that settlement, the post notes. Lightning diagram from eltoo announcement blog post: https://blockstream.com/2018/04/30/eltoo-next-lightning.html\nWhat's perhaps the most beneficial part of the proposal, though, is that it isn't built on a \"winner takes all\" model.\nInstead, eltoo and older L2 penalty schemes can be used side-by-side.\n\"Eltoo has quite different tradeoffs. I'm not implying it's better in all senses,\" Decker told CoinDesk, pointing to some arguments on the bitcoin developer mailing list about the technology increasing waiting times for transactions to be settled.\nStill, overall, he's pretty excited about eltoo and the simplicity it brings, adding:\n\"We don't know which one is nicer, but I would like eltoo as the better option. I think eltoo is easier to explain and to extend later on.\" Code obstacle\nNot only are developers still discussing the proposal's merits, but there's another thing standing in the technology's way – \"sighash_noinput.\"\nThis long-anticipated code option needs to be added to the bitcoin codebase for the cryptocurrency to be able to support eltoo (at least in an efficient form).\nTo understand why, it's important to know what the basic sighash function does. It works as a flag of sorts that specifies what part of the transaction data needs to be signed when it's transferred over to someone else. Users can choose from a range of options – for instance, the default flag, sighash_all, indicates that all parts of the transaction need to be signed, meaning that none of these parts can be changed throughout the process.\nThe proposed \"sighash_noinput\" function could flag that the \"input\" data going into a transaction doesn't need to be signed. And in turn, that the input data can change over time, from when the transaction was created to when it's written to the blockchain.\nAnd this is exactly what eltoo needs, since the concept is that all the state in between the beginning and final transaction will be deleted, meaning the input will be different from the start and the end.\nWhen asked whether he thinks the sighash_noinput proposal will get merged into the bitcoin codebase, Decker laughed and said, \"Ever since SegWit, I stopped making these predictions.\"\nHe's pointing to the fact that Segregated Witness (SegWit) had broad support from the bulk of bitcoin's most active developers, but ended up stirring up a years-long battle within the community. The code change was only added to bitcoin last August, even though it was proposed more than two years prior.\nStill, even though it's early, the sighash_noinput function is a relatively easy change to make to bitcoin's codebase, Decker said.\nPlus, it's been theorized for some time that the change would have many positive implications for developers, he continued. Because of these potential benefits, a handful of Twitter users have begun adding the code change to their profiles to express their support, much like Twitter users did during the scaling debate (with #No2X becoming popular among those who were opposed to the Segwit2x initiative).\nRemaining hopeful, Decker concluded:\nElectricity warning box image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation—in bitcoin . Representational image. Reuters.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency.

I personally believe Safedice is the coolest dice site around but I stopped playing there for a competitor since their support is too poorly managed. I know the owner is trustworthy but a good service is a must.\nAnd, sorry, but your reassurances make no much sense.\nhaving one guy doesn't explain how bad the support is there , I know many sites that have one or two guys that managing their sites in a better way\nsparing 2 hours a day may solve the problem , but thing are way slow in safe dice and many are complaining about it\nThey should really consider to look at to this matter because they do still have players who do make some complaints, If they dont like to lose up players on the site then they should took into consideration on granting this request and i dont rather see this as a request but a compulsory thing to be done by a gambling site owner.
