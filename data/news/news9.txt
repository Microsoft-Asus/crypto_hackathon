The previous bullish momentum was capable of printing its all-time high near $20,000, but many questions have arisen since then, particularly in regard to regulatory grey areas. Adoption and compliance to governments regulation for the cryptocurrency market and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are expected to drive the price of Bitcoin upwards. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Bitcoin Could Shoot up as Coinbase and Circle Seek SEC License\nCoinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is attempting to become a fully SEC-regulated brokerage firm and electronic-trading venue in order to better navigate the financial system and become a valuable option for retail and institutional players. For that purpose, the operator has announced it will acquire Keystone Capital.\nThis move is evidence that regulation is smoothing out and could be an uplifting variable for Bitcoin prices, according to Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, in a note to clients. Here he calls the announcement an implicit recognition that the regulatory tide is shifting.\n“We believe the regulatory picture is now improving — best evidenced by Coinbase and Circle ‘running towards’ regulation. We are basing this on the notion that Coinbase and Circle would only take these actions if such was the case.”\nCircle, a cryptocurrency platform backed by Goldman Sachs, is seeking a federal banking license as it looks to make moves into the highly regulated realm of U.S. banks and brokerages. As of yet, however, no crypto-related organization has obtained such status with U.S. regulators.\n“We believe both companies would only make these moves if their perception of regulatory risks in crypto was improving”.\nA key issue yet to solve is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not decided which cryptocurrencies are to be considered securities. The regulatory body has explained that the Howey Test, created by the supreme court in 1946, is able to determine whether a digital token can be subject to the same regulations as stocks and bonds.\nSEC chair Jay Clayton has recently admitted that digital tokens from ICOs are securities. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has previously stipulated that cryptocurrencies are commodities and subject to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nAt the New York Blockchain and Digital Assets Summit, the SEC’s cyber unit division chief Robert Cohen has said the regulator does not wish to hurt the development of the ecosystem.\n“We want to encourage innovation and new ways of raising capital. If there’s a new and exciting tech people should have an opportunity to invest in it (…) Every time there’s an exciting new technology, people are afraid of missing out they see people becoming millionaires overnight, there’s a high risk of people falling victim to fraud.”\nAdding to Coinbase and Circle, Templum LLC has also registered with the SEC to operate as a licensed brokerage firm and alternative trading system. The operator plans to offer a trading platform for regulated tokens.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

The president noted that “by definition” neither Russia, nor any other country could have a national cryptocurrency. Putin also mentioned the saga around Telegram, in the light of seeking “civilized” decisions. Cows and Cryptocurrencies\nFrom potholes to spaceports, the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin usually covers it all. It is hard to imagine there is absolutely no preparation or plot behind the scenes, but one has to admit – four hours of questions can be a grueling challenge for anyone’s concentration and intellectual power.\nPutin sounds adequate on just about any topic, and almost all the time. Well, this year he was unprepared to answer at least one question: “Why is cow meat called ‘beef’?” To his credit, the deputy prime minister for agriculture, Alexey Gordeyev, didn’t know the answer either…\nThis year’s program aired in a redesigned format, touched a bit here and there. And, as with any “rationalization” in a former Soviet, Slavic country, the change was met with a proper dose of criticism.\nAs a new feature of the 2018 “Direct Line” – bloggers and vloggers were allowed to ask questions on behalf of their followers. This is how cryptocurrency came into the spotlight, and this time the president was abreast of developments. No National Crypto, ‘by Definition’\nVlogger Artiom Khokholikov tested Putin with a couple of questions that “all youngsters are interested in” – will Russia have its own cryptocurrency, and if, will it be controlled by the state? Also – does the president think that in the near future cryptocurrency will replace completely the standard fiat money? Starting with the cryptoruble topic, Putin remarked the question was somewhat incorrect. Neither Russia, nor any other country can have their own crypto, “by definition,” he educated the nation. “If we talk about cryptocurrency – this is something that goes beyond national borders,” explained the president.\nTicking another box, Putin mentioned the “so called mining,” which, as he pointed out, is not regulated in Russia. The situation, however, will change soon with the adoption of the new legislation currently under review in the Duma. Then he emphasized authorities in Moscow have a very “accurate” attitude towards the whole crypto subject. Russia Should Consider its Participation\nOf course, the omnipresent talking points of central power were to be expected from the strongman of a strong state. “In the overwhelming majority of countries cryptocurrency is not a means of account. It is partially used in Japan, but in other countries it doesn’t work,” Vladimir Putin said.\nThe president went on to remind of the official position of Russia’s Central Bank that cryptocurrencies cannot be a means of payment or saving, and that digital money is not backed by anything. That means, he stressed, that “We have to treat this very accurately and carefully.”\n“Nevertheless”, Putin changed the tone, “such phenomenon has its place in the world, it is developing! We have to carefully analyze, watch what’s going on, and see at what stage and how we can participate in this process and use it, including by the way, to avoid any restrictions in the sphere of international financial activity.” Putin Suggests ‘Civilized’ Approach to Telegram\nThe Russian head of state touched another topic that concerns the crypto community – the fate of the messaging service Telegram . Prohibition is the easiest way to go, he noted, but also suggested that it’s necessary to seek civilized ways to solve the problem.\nRussian authorities have been trying to block the messenger since April 16, following a decision by the Tagansky District Court of Moscow from April 13. So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful and Telegram has managed to circumvent the imposed restrictions.\nRussian special services claim the app has been used by terrorists and have requested its encryption keys. However, the company founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov has refused to hand them over.\nAccording to Russian media, many members of the local Telegram community have interpreted Putin’s comments as a signal to the country’s telecom regulator, Roskomnadzor , and the Federal Security Service, FSB , to ease the pressure on the messenger.\nDo you think Russia will eventually legalize and adopt cryptocurrencies?

Bitcoin and Ethereum are still trading above the trendlines broken yesterday, but Ripple has failed to do so and has been rejected to the downside slowly but consistently.\nIt looks quite likely that Bitcoin and Ethereum might lose its current support and get back to a bearish scenario again.\nBTC/USD 4H chart\nBitcoin is sliding down since yesterday, when it conquered and escaped from the bearish trendline. This is a very uncomfortable scenario for traders, as BTC/USD has gotten to a new technical scenario that favors new position-taking, but the current price action is just setting new relative lows with not much bullish action going on.\nOn the downside, there are very important supports at the 50-EMA located at $7599, the level that also matches with the trendline broken yesterday (now a support). Below there, we can find the next support at the 100-SMA, located around $7521. If we reach that level, Bitcoin would go back to the previous scenario and complicated its short-term development. Below there, a price congestion support would still remain at $7400.\nOn the bullish side, the first resistance is at $7860, as the previous step to an attack of the 200-SMA, now trading at the $8080 mark. It looks quite difficult to go further in the short term, as this is a very important moving average that provides a massive resistance.\nMACD in the Bitcoin 4-hour chart is still on the bullish area of the indicator, showing a bearish lateral profile that perfectly reflects the price action.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart shows a technical tie between buyers and sellers. Both forces are below the 20 level that signals trend strength, with a very slight edge for the sellers. ADX is sinking, showing that there is no direction at all.\nETH/USD 4H chart\nEthereum is showing a very similar situation than Bitcoin, although it has been able to find support at the 50-EMA that has evolved better and is now above the trendline, giving ETH/USD some meaningful support. Anyway, there is still a considerable risk of losing these key supports, with ETH/USD likely visiting the 100-SMA, still below the trendline with an accentuated bearish profile.\nOn the downside, the first support is at the aforementioned 50-EMA, located at $695, with some distance to the second support, now located at $594. If that one was lost, ETH/USD would get back to the previous bearish scenario, which would take Ethereum to look for support in the price level standing at $565.\nOn the bullish side, the first resistance is located at $620, mid-way from the 200-SMA, the main bullish target located at $649. We could find a bit further up the road the price resistance at $659, although it seems unlikely that this will succeed, at least on its first attempt, as the 200-SMA provides a very important barrier.\nMACD in the Ethereum 4-hour chart shows a very flat profile, with confirms the tight range that we have seen the last days. This is all the tactical information we can get from it.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart shows some edge to the sellers, that are trading above the 20 level that indicates trend strength. Buyers, despite being close, have not been able to overcome this level, which signals some weakness. ADX is plummeting and confirms the total lack of trend strength in the price action.\nXRP/USD 4H chart\nYesterday, we described Ripple's scenario as a bit more positive than its counterparts, but stressing the closeness of the 200-SMA as a big resistance and the bigger distance from the most important supports at the 50-EMA and the 100-SMA. Today, these technical conditions are sending XRP/USD back to the 50-EMA, back to the bearish side of the chart and complicating the bullish outlook in the short term.\nOn the bearish side, the first support is located at the $0.664 price congestion level, with the 50-EMA moving a bit below at $0.655. Until this level, the damage for bulls would be limited, but if that is lost and keeps going down to the 100-SMA, right around $0.63, then the short-term projection would severely worsen.\nOn the bullish side, there are clear targets to re-conquer for the bulls at the trendline that is now located at $0.69. Before this one, it will need to break above the 200-SMA at $0.6760 and later overcome a price congestion resistance located at $0.68. These are pretty important barriers to break, so the bulls don't have an easy path.\nMACD in the Ripple 4-hour chart has broken out its horizontal profile to the bearish side and now looks to find support at the equilibrium line. Bearish outlook for today's session, probably continuing over the weekend.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart shows the edge for the sellers for the first time since last May 29th, when XRP/USD was trading around $0.55. Both forces are barely above the trend existance level (20). ADX has lost such level by a bit, now is located around 19.8. Bearish lateral scenario.

With ancient members such as J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachsthey immediately added heaps of more spouses to their roster. The smooth beginning shortly encountered some turbulence however and in 2016 Goldman Sachs pulled from their organization. Last year-old May R3 allegedly raised $107 million in capital and also suggested that it was a first round and they had been aiming at raising an additional $107 million at another tranche since the consortium was being assembled out. The firm is in financial trouble despite having recently increased an additional $15 million by a group of three fiscal sector investors based on the former workers who state that the first $107 million round of financing is questionable. The dispute within the 107 million figure stems from 1 employee stating that it comprises fees taken in prior to the financing round. Fortune verified that using the firm that surrendered it had just increased $98.2 million in new cash in the moment. The former worker who requested Fortune for anonymity so as to keep working relationships went further stating that the organization’s internal earnings estimates are “laughably off” and possibly “10x short”. Managing manager Charlie Cooper disputes these claims and informed luck that the company had exceeded its earnings goals for 2017 and might upgrade all their financials at the end of the year. Saying that executives traveled regularly in first and business class to meetings which might have been obtained on the internet and that firm had expanded past their requirements, among the informants is quoted from the article stating, “Just look at the public information. You see their hiring plan and the number of people on their website, There’s also expensive real estate in London and New York.” Another origin of contention is CEO David Rutter’s salary that former staffer called” outrageous “. Though the firm wouldn’t offer a guess they did react to Forbes stating” David’s salary is commensurate with exchange rates for a leadership position and has been accepted by the board ,” Questions roughly R3’s viability move past its own fiscal struggles as the firm struggles to entice programmers to build out its Corda applications. Corda has been developed within an open-source system that the company claims to own 350 contributors to and 50 programmers producing the code. There is likewise an enterprise edition of Corda that includes commercial extensions into the open source variant. There is a fiscal expectation for R3 in the shape of a lawsuit it’s engaged in using the cryptocurrency firm Ripple more than solutions which R3 supposedly provided, which Ripple asserts they did not. The lawsuit is for 5 billion XRP tokens worth roughly $3 billion dollars. A settlement is anticipated before the case reaches trial.

CME’s bitcoin futures derive their final value from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Manipulative trading in those markets could skew the price of bitcoin futures that the government directly regulates.\nCME, which launched bitcoin futures in December, asked the four exchanges to share reams of trading data after its first contract settled in January, people familiar with the matter said. But several of the exchanges declined to comply, arguing the request was intrusive, the people said. The exchanges ultimately provided some data, but only after CME limited its request to a few hours of activity, instead of a full day, and restricted to a few market participants, the people added.\nThe dispute frustrated CME’s regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, these people said. In response, the commission subpoenaed the exchanges for the data. CFTC officials backed the launch of bitcoin futures, saying they viewed it as a risky but worthwhile project.\nThe CFTC was upset CME didn’t have in place agreements that would compel bitcoin markets to share trading data tied to futures contracts, these people said. Such agreements would detail what information the cryptocurrency venues would have to provide to CME, including the time of trades, unfilled or canceled orders, the size of orders, and traders’ identities.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com\nPopular on WSJ.com:\nAnthony Bourdain, CNN host, is found dead in apparent suicide\nAmericans’ wealth surpasses $100 trillion\nThe one reason you should claim social security at 62\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-reason-you-should-claim-social-security-at-62-1528383432?mod=trending_now_3", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-1528492835?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-net-worth-surpasses-100-trillion-1528387386?mod=trending_now_2", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthony-bourdain-cnn-tv-host-is-found-dead-1528458689?mod=trending_now_1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme group inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitstamp", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-09T01:05:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53d6373e1982d5c569758711e19b5b9c8052bef5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4W_WUzYmXf6dzwZ3UPvxP_okhzOyX_fWKxSgdoUCE9FD9ueAVWyRe8KDxEGtivqQSehewe6pqI9YErbbfUHcdyUJBKbS15YlEgSs8Q9Tk3sq0B78SxAABJHnb5YjNrd5Xw--", "site_full": "www.fool.com.au", "site": "fool.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS edge higher | Motley Fool Australia", "title_full": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS edge higher | Motley Fool Australia", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/altcoin-crypto.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45571, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53d6373e1982d5c569758711e19b5b9c8052bef5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4W_WUzYmXf6dzwZ3UPvxP_okhzOyX_fWKxSgdoUCE9FD9ueAVWyRe8KDxEGtivqQSehewe6pqI9YErbbfUHcdyUJBKbS15YlEgSs8Q9Tk3sq0B78SxAABJHnb5YjNrd5Xw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Mickleboro", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS edge higher | Motley Fool Australia", "text": "James Mickleboro | June 8, 2018\nIt has been a reasonably positive 24 hours of trade for the cryptocurrency market.

In the press release, the IOTA Foundation targeted two key areas that Qubic will address in relation to augmented IOTA utility: smart contracts that allow for micro-payment transactions made in real-time (for use in streaming, ride rentals, etc.), and a reward system that incentivizes user participation through Tangle.\nWhile there was some initial confusion over whether Qubic constituted a new coin birthed out of the IOTA project, the press release put a definitive end to the speculation, stating that Qubic is neither a standalone currency, ICO, or forthcoming airdrop. Instead, it works as an application in conjunction with IOTA, serving to improve the functionality of the latter while also providing features novel to IOTA such as smart contracts. Even without function as a standalone currency, the two projects have significant overlap in terms of outlook and potential disruption for the 8-billion-plus IoT devices,\n“In the long term, Qubic will allow people to leverage world-wide unused computing capacity for a myriad of computational needs, all while helping to secure the IOTA Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer.” The Qubic platform will be the most significant contribution to the IOTA stack, it will enable unlimited new use cases and turn the IOTA Project into a full solution. Information and details are beginning to be unveiled right now at https://t.co/U87nKaZWnI #IOTA #Qubic\n— IOTA (@iotatoken) June 3, 2018\nFrom the press release, there are two significant advantages that emerge from Qubic implementation: Smart contracts. While cryptocurrency based smart contracts have primarily been associated with Ethereum, the potential for IOTA-backed contracts is arguably greater. Tangle, IOTA’s network protocol that allows for near-infinite scale, is superior to Ethereum’s current utility, which limits transactions per second at 15, as well as transaction fees hovering in the 0.50 USD range. IOTA has zero transaction fees and increases scalability as more users participate on the network. This increases the usability of smart contracts, further allowing for innovation such as the aforementioned microtransactions. Since the early days of Bitcoin, micropayments have been hailed as a genuine improvement for cryptocurrency over traditional fiat. The current digital model for payment is incompatible with small (think pennies being sent instantly) transactions that could offer a potential replacement for the current revenue model of invasive advertisements. It also creates new platform uses for social media, or even educational portals (imagine paying to have access to live Harvard lectures as opposed to attending a costly institution). Smart contracts remove the need for expensive third-parties by using the advancement of cryptocurrency to both authenticate and secure agreed upon transactions. Incentives for current IOTA users. The power of Tangle lies in the ability for the network to scale with user volume. The more users participating in IOTA’s network, the faster transactions occur, which increases utility for all parties involved. The competitive landscape of cryptocurrency is going to eventually boil down to coercing user and investors, particularly as currencies become more than just a function of exchange speculation. TRON is a good example of a currency that has been proactive in recruiting development and users to the new launch of Main Net. IOTA appears to be following a similar path, by creating a reward system that encourages investors to participate in facilitating network features, as opposed to just hoarding the coins. Likely, through Qubic, IOTA users will be paid a small portion of a coin for operating Tangle, or else they might receive some special preference in conducting transactions. Either way, Qubic seeks to incentivize both user participation and network functionality for IOTA.\nWhile IOTA has already made a strong case for its presence in the top ten market capitalization of cryptocurrency, Qubic could be the added push it needs to attain a top five spot. The addition of smart contracts is a significant feature that will be difficult to appreciate in the near-term, hence the lack of price movement following the Qubic press release. However, with the combination of industry-leading scale in Tangle and the presence of network features through smart contracts, IOTA is building a strong case for a currency targeting genuine innovation as opposed to being another re-hashing of Bitcoin.\nAdvantages of Qubic Make IOTA Top 5 Currency was originally published on http://technewsleader.com/ .

Minor Movement\nYesterday, on June 7, CCN reported that the cryptocurrency market has stabilized to an extent, as both major cryptocurrencies and minor tokens remained in the same region for over a week, struggling to initiate movements on the upside.\nShort-term stability in the cryptocurrency market often lead to two outcomes: a significant break to the upside or a slow bleed out to previous support levels. Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin dropped from $7,700 to $7,550, deleting its gains on June 7 and ending its short-term recovery back to $8,800.\nIf BTC fails to rebound to $7,700 in the upcoming hours, within the next 12 hours maximum, a break below the $7,000 region can be expected. It is likely that BTC falls below $7,000, if a major support level at around $7,400 as seen in the 4-hour chart of BTC below is broken.\nThe majority of investors including prominent trader Peter Brandt predicted an upside break for BTC throughout this week. But, as CCN emphasized on June 6, predictions on the upside are conditional and based on an assumption that the volume of BTC recovers in the short-term. Throughout the past two weeks, the daily trading volume of BTC has remained relatively low, in comparison to early 2018.\n“BTC is setting up for a big move soon. From a pure charting point of view the move could be in either direction. In fact, the burden of truth is on the bulls,” said Brandt on June 7, as BTC seemed to build strong foundation for an upside movement. But, the upside movement ended in the $7,700 region, falling below $7,600 once again.\nIn the short-term, given the low volume of BTC and Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, it is likely that BTC falls below the $7,000 mark and altcoins or tokens fall substantially against both the US dollar and BTC.\nMost traders agree that BTC will likely initiate a strong rally by the end of the third quarter of 2018, supported by a huge spike in volume and demand. But, in the short-term, investors have to acknowledge the fact that the cryptocurrency market is dealing with a bear cycle, mostly due to the lack of volumes. Tokens Struggling\nOntology (ONT), Aelf (ELF), 0x (ZRX), and others that have seen an exponential increase in value over the past month have started to struggle against both the US dollar and BTC. If Ether continues to fall influenced by the downward trend of BTC, tokens will likely suffer a larger drop in value than major cryptocurrencies.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:06:43.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d552e20fb3258d95b00ba29e3e8cfbbe6c1dba0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS97X8os6qTSL_x9Imdjn47s-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

Despite their centralized nature, consumers and speculators rely heavily on these platforms on a daily basis. For Bitfinex users, there was a slight scare on Tuesday when trading was halted for a short while. Another Issue for Bitfinex\nAlthough cryptocurrency exchanges have seen their fair share of issues throughout the years, it seems some problems will persist. In the case of the Bitfinex trading platform, its popularity is also the root cause for some of the problems the company has had to deal with. Addressing these issues will not be easy by any means.\nOn Tuesday, the company was forced to suspend all trading activity for a while. As one would expect, this decision sparked a lot of debate and confusion regarding what was going on exactly. In most cases, such developments mean the trading platform in question has run into major issues of some kind.\nThankfully, it seems this particular incident was not linked to a hack or other mishap affecting the company. Instead, its servers were the target of another DDoS attack. Anyone who has kept close tabs on the cryptocurrency industry will know how common DDoS attacks are, especially when it comes to specific exchanges. Bitfinex is currently under extreme load. We are investigating the issue and will keep you all up to date as we learn more.\n— Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 5, 2018\nOne of the Bitfinex infrastructure service providers had to deal with a denial of service attack, but it seems the issue was resolved fairly quickly. The attacker’s identity remains unknown at this time, and it’s also unclear why this provider was attacked in the first place. While trading on Bitfinex was suspended, the Bitcoin price fell by slightly over 2%, further confirming the feeble state of this market today.\nIt is important to note that this DDoS attack did not disrupt Bitfinex accounts or user balances whatsoever. It only impacted the trading operations themselves, which is why the company was forced to suspend all trading for a brief while. Thankfully, it seems all users can now trade on Bitfinex once again without any major problems, although this may not necessarily be the last DDoS attack against a cryptocurrency firm, either directly or indirectly.\nIt will be interesting to see how Bitfinex and its service providers address issues like these moving forward. Centralized exchanges will always remain a critical problem in this industry until decentralized cryptocurrency trading becomes the new normal. Until then, cryptocurrency trading platforms will need to beef up their DDoS protection, among other things. loading...

The company had allegedly duped 8,000 investors of Rs2,000 crore ($300 million), and now British businessman Raj Kundra and other Bollywood celebrities , too, have been dragged into the mess.\nIn the early days, as cryptocurrencies caught on in India, frauds were limited to phishing and hacking. Then, came multi-level marketing schemes. Now virtual money is even being demanded as ransom .\nPhishing and hacking: It is one of the oldest tricks in the book. An email is sent from a seemingly genuine address, asking users to click on a link and/or fill in details. These links usually contain malware that affects the systems and clones the investors data, robbing them of their funds. In other cases, a hacker may hold the important files on your system as ransom, until they are paid in cryptocurrencies.\nEarlier this year, a New Delhi-based investor approached the authorities after she lost bitcoin worth Rs6.5 lakh to hacking. She lost another Rs35 lakh to crooks who promised to help retrieve the earlier amount.\nFake apps and social media accounts: Fake apps have been flooding the app stores. In other cases, counterfeit websites and Twitter handles are used to dupe gullible investors. For instance, users of Zebpay , a cryptocurrency exchange in India, received messagesasking them to deposit a certain amount as part of a survey, in exchange for bitcoins. These messages were sent out from a Twitter handle that looked very similar to Zebpay’s actual account.\nPonzi schemes: The golden rule of investing is that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. In the case of GainBitcoin, Bharadwaj had promised investors a 10% monthly return on cryptocurrency investments for 18 months under multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes such as Bitcoin Growth Fund . The MLM schemes are tiered marketing plans in which investors are rewarded for bringing more people into the fold. The old investors are paid off with the help of money ploughed in by the new customers, till the scheme falls flat.\nIn another case, investors in OneCoin, another company that launched a digital coin-led investment scheme, realised that the firm didn’t even have a registered office address or a bank account. Nearly, 400 people were taken in by the promise of high returns.\nBlockchain consultant Pramod Emjay warns that any investment offer that promises to make you rich quickly should raise a red flag. “The types of scams that are being followed are not new at all. These are just old scams in new garbs. Therefore, investor needs to follow the same rule of being very cautious.”\nExchanges under attack: In April, Coinsecure, a New Delhi-based cryptocurrency exchange, was robbed of 438 bitcoins worth Rs20 crore. The firm named an employee in a first information report filed later that month, while promising to refund money to its investors in due time . It’s the first time that an exchange came under an attack in India. But, globally such cases are well known.\nOther crimes: The skyrocketing prices of cryptocurrencies have drawn investors and swindlers alike. Now, tech-savvy kidnappers in India have also been asking for bitcoin as ransom . In April, nine police officers in Gujarat were held for extorting 200 units of a digital currency from a businessman.\nWho is to blame? India’s digital currency ecosystem is currently unregulated. Therefore, investors don’t have a grievance redressal authority to approach during distress.\nHowever, cryptocurrency firms—already cornered by the central bank — argue that the entire ecosystem can’t be blamed. “Wherever there is money, there will be scams and there is nothing surprising about that,” said the head of a virtual currency exchange, requesting anonymity. “But that doesn’t mean that you can blame the whole system because investors are being stupid and jumping into these random money making schemes or clicking on strange links to make a quick buck.”\n© Provided by Quartz India-crypto-scams", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://inc42.com/buzz/raj-kundras-questioning-by-ed-over-bitcoin-scam-brings-up-name-of-9-more-celebrities/", "https://inc42.com/buzz/who-is-amit-bhardwaj-the-real-story-behind-300-mn-bitcoin-ponzi-schemes/", "http://qz.com/?utm_source=msn", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hackers-hit-traders-in-old-delhi-demand-bitcoin-as-ransom/story-6gnIKq4MaZb9MyZdgqwoAK.html", "https://coinsecure.in/", "https://blog.zebpay.com/your-complete-guide-to-bitcoin-related-scams-5113f8d02c26", "https://qz.com/1295627/indian-cryptocurrency-exchanges-to-rbi-probe-and-regulate-us-dont-ban/", "https://qz.com/1141021/the-bitcoin-boom-is-drawing-indian-investors-like-never-before/", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bitcoins-worth-rs-41l-stolen-from-womans-e-wallet-account/articleshow/63372882.cms", "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/bitcoins-worth-rs-20-crore-stolen-from-exchange-in-indias-biggest-crypto-theft/articleshow/63740771.cms", "https://qz.com/1249603/bitcoin-crime-kidnapped-indian-businessman-paid-200-bitcoin-ransom/", "https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/bitcoin-gox/", "https://qz.com/1298200/with-raj-kundras-entry-indias-biggest-cryptocurrency-scam-gets-murkier/", "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/onecoin-online-fraud-case-investors-promised-massive-returns-on-rs-11900-investment-got-scammed-instead/643303/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nupur anand", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "quartz", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T14:08:04.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d9351e4f3d0478a0edd0ad2966b5287c35bda37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEDUDYUqCCVDP_7LqpuuD8cRNF77H6BiVCeY2UENxKlFSQKItPbtlQINYQwXHBZt4BvayWGObNFen_SHqfvdNg", "site_full": "coincapprice.com", "site": "coincapprice.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $7,700", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $7,700", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CL", "spam_score": 0.177, "main_image": "https://coincapprice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/daily-chart-3.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d9351e4f3d0478a0edd0ad2966b5287c35bda37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEDUDYUqCCVDP_7LqpuuD8cRNF77H6BiVCeY2UENxKlFSQKItPbtlQINYQwXHBZt4BvayWGObNFen_SHqfvdNg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $7,700", "text": "Home / Trending News / Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $7,700 Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $7,700 in Trending News 0\n#Currency #MarketCap, #Ethereum, #BitcoinCash, #Litecoin, #Dash, #EthereumClassic,\nAt press time, bitcoin is trading at the $7,700 mark. This is the highest it’s been in several days after suffering through several small, but noticeable drops that brought it down to $7,300 during Tuesday’s early morning hours.\nOne of the biggest bitcoin pushes recently came from an unlikely source: the SEC. Chairman Jay Clayton is insisting that while specific altcoins (which ultimately went unnamed) are classified as securities, bitcoin is, and always will be, a commodity.\nBitcoin is designed to serve as a “monetary replacement” of standard fiat currencies such as USD, the yen and the euro, and in so doing does not fall into the securities category despite investors being able to garner profit and capital from bitcoin.\nThe primary pressure now lies on the altcoin space, as many currencies have been distributed through initial coin offerings or ICOs. Clayton explains that any coin distributed through a fundraising effort means that the goals of both the investors and the organizers alike were to garner profit from potential returns. This classifies these cryptocurrencies as securities, which inherently places them under strict SEC guidelines.\nOne of the big questions is whether this idea could potentially affect ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency and the number one competitor to bitcoin. In its earliest days, ether was distributed as a presale (now known as an ICO) token, but has become so decentralized in recent years that giving it “security status” isn’t likely to make sense. Granted ether is labeled as a security in the future, its price could be largely affected, and investors may see the numbers going down very quickly.\nAt press time, Ethereum is back over the $600 mark, though some analysts believe the SEC’s stance on ICOs could bear short-term negative consequences on the altcoin space.\nIn the meantime, bitcoin is expected to incur a solid break out in the coming weeks, and financial experts are reforming their year-end predictions. David Hanson, a blockchain expert and CEO of the gaming platform Ultra, explained in a recent interview that bitcoin could see an additional $1,000 added to its current price sooner than anticipated. Speaking with The Independent , Hanson stated:\n“I believe bitcoin’s price will continue to fluctuate between $6,500 and $8,500 in the coming weeks. In the medium-to-long term, bitcoin’s value should go up, as big institutions enter the crypto space in a bid to gain first-mover advantages, further legitimizing the market.”\nUK managing director of the investment platform e-Toro Iqbal Gandham holds similar sentiment. He believes ongoing institutional capital trickling its way into the cryptocurrency space will bring digital assets the attention they deserve, and likely cause bitcoin to once again spike beyond the $10,000 mark by the end of summer.\n“As the regulatory landscape clears up, we can expect far more investors, including big ticket institutions, to make their first cryptocurrency investments,” he confidently explained. “For the first few months of this year, the crypto industry has been jogging along at a relatively slow pace, waiting for the opportunity to stretch into a sprint. This may be that moment.”\nCoinCapPrice CoinCapPrice – Cryptocurrency Market Capitalizations, The latest Bitcoin price for today (up to the minute).

There is a chance we'll drop a little more before we go up. If not then the smaller ABC correction is already over. Prediction of others: The expectations of others have remained the same. Everyone is currently expecting either doom or moon. My last prediction: At my last idea, I expected an ABC correction, which also occurred. Of course, I did not give any targets, as I said that for the moment we can not know what the correction looks like. Only at the end is it possible to identify the correct pattern, otherwise trading would be far too easy. Last idea: My current prediction: After we have (almost) finished the correction I expect another impulse upwards. This impulse should go up to my fibonacci level, which is about @$8,000, $7,978 to be exact. Of course there is also the chance that we will turn back before or after. You never know. When trading, you should be open to all scenarios. Final word: Since there were some who asked me, I wanted to say that you can ignore the final crash charts for now. There are currently so many people waiting for a crash. However, I think these people need to be bullish before. So I expect some bull and bear traps before it really crashes. In the future I will try not to do so many long term charts any more. I know roughly how it will look in the end, but you can not know how long the correction will take until the crash comes. So it's very likely that they are wrong. But the move down will come. The only thing is you can not say how long and how far yet. This is still too far in the future (estimated 2-3 months). Comment: Short update: Also check out my ideas for Verge and Bitcoin Cash. Good luck. Bitcoin Cash: Verge: Comment: Short update: Just wanted to justify why I wrote at all ideas that we could see a drop again. I expect the upmove in any case, only the problem is that I can not correctly identify patterns with low volume and at low time frame. Most likely it will happen the scenario you see on the chart below. Breaking the 'trend line' would cause everyone to think we would drop a lot.

A decade ago it was hedge funds and bankers selling small shares in works by Andy Warhol and his ilk as investment opportunities. Today it's the cryptocurrency crowd.\nIf history’s a guide, the risk and cost of owning a tiny part of an illiquid, hard-to-value asset still outweighs the rewards. And all that without ever getting to hang the picture on your wall.\nThe new tilt at art trading is as much a throwback to pre-crisis financial engineering as it is about crypto-futurism. A British gallery is promising to sell up to 49 percent of Warhol’s 14 Small Electric Chairs in a blockchain-powered online auction. Buyers can pay in Bitcoin, Ether or other tokens. They’ll take cash too if you’re that way inclined.\nThese micro-stakes would then be traded on a marketplace. There may be a blockchain verifying transactions, and crypto-currencies changing hands, but we've seen art investment pools and art stock markets before. They don't always end well.\nDespite all the airy talk about democratizing art ownership and disrupting the gilded world of auction houses and dealers, this doesn’t really do that. Nobody owning a piece of the Warhol will take it home. It's locked up in a tax-free zone somewhere. What’s being traded is a stake in the special purpose vehicle that holds it.\nThis may be a wonderful way for the ultimate owner to make money from an artwork without taking it out of storage or ceding control, but it's hardly the Barnes Foundation.\nAs for the idea that this is a clever bet on the future value of a piece of art, these assets are as risky as any others. The art market is illiquid and can be volatile. Blue-chip artists are no protection against a market crash. Even Warhols were sold at a loss during the financial crisis. Do punters know the difference between this “Electric chairs” canvas, which the gallery says has been valued at 4.2 million pounds ($5.6 million), and others by the same artist?\nImagine what the combined volatility of cryptocurrency markets and the art market might create in times of stress. Liquidity would evaporate. That initial buy-in fee of 2 percent wouldn’t seem so cheap then.\nWarhol himself might have enjoyed the idea of trading and owning pieces of art that you've never seen. And there is at least one tangible thing on offer: The people running the auction say buyers can choose to receive a special scanned print of the work in question, which to the naked eye looks just as good as the original. As David Bowie once sang in a song about Warhol: “Can't tell them apart at all.”\nIf people do manage to make money from this, then finance truly will have reached its post-modern apotheosis.\nTo contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andy warhol", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warhol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg opinion", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "small electric chairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:53:39.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37bc366d87d8af9a06fee4b9826f943c18f853e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDatQGHxuWTsMGJnMR8rSi1GBnikkfR6HIOyintohgrjM1cylYsB1B5H3eNabt5if3yG.T8sao2bMXb2eWfvpvLPPoMjRlVOHZ6ePGZdNd2cwWCp6oH3GhzfifLVVVWe_AyM-", "site_full": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Dell EMC Collaborates With SAP And Camelot ITLab To Offer Solutions For Data Security – Bitcoin Notes", "title_full": "Dell EMC Collaborates With SAP And Camelot ITLab To Offer Solutions For Data Security – Bitcoin Notes", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "https://bitcoin-notes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dell-EMC-Collaborates-With-SAP-And-CamelotITLab-On-Data-Security-06-07-2018.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37bc366d87d8af9a06fee4b9826f943c18f853e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDatQGHxuWTsMGJnMR8rSi1GBnikkfR6HIOyintohgrjM1cylYsB1B5H3eNabt5if3yG.T8sao2bMXb2eWfvpvLPPoMjRlVOHZ6ePGZdNd2cwWCp6oH3GhzfifLVVVWe_AyM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dell EMC Collaborates With SAP And Camelot ITLab To Offer Solutions For Data Security – Bitcoin Notes", "text": "Bitcoin Set to Challenge Downtrend in ‘Next Couple of Days’, Says Fundstrat Advisor 8 Jun, 2018 PR: EO Obtains Licenses for Crypto-Fiat Exchange and Wallet as Its Initial Coin Sale Continues 8 Jun, 2018 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "jun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dell emc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T21:29:59.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfa1bd0b9b60ad6f6721f85be23bd2bea6522f80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS41mMWc5JUHn2c0GAsZxCa4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfa1bd0b9b60ad6f6721f85be23bd2bea6522f80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS41mMWc5JUHn2c0GAsZxCa4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!

CME’s bitcoin futures derive their final value from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Manipulative trading in those markets could skew the price of bitcoin futures that the government directly regulates.\nCME, which launched bitcoin futures in December, asked the four exchanges to share reams of trading data after its first contract settled in January, people familiar with the matter said. But several of the exchanges declined to comply, arguing the request was intrusive, the people said. The exchanges ultimately provided some data, but only after CME limited its request to a few hours of activity, instead of a full day, and restricted to a few market participants, the people added.\nThe dispute frustrated CME’s regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, these people said. In response, the commission subpoenaed the exchanges for the data. CFTC officials backed the launch of bitcoin futures, saying they viewed it as a risky but worthwhile project.\nThe CFTC was upset CME didn’t have in place agreements that would compel bitcoin markets to share trading data tied to futures contracts, these people said. Such agreements would detail what information the cryptocurrency venues would have to provide to CME, including the time of trades, unfilled or canceled orders, the size of orders, and traders’ identities.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com\nPopular on WSJ.com:\nAnthony Bourdain, CNN host, is found dead in apparent suicide\nAmericans’ wealth surpasses $100 trillion\nThe one reason you should claim social security at 62\nWe Want to Hear from You Join the conversation\nComment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-reason-you-should-claim-social-security-at-62-1528383432?mod=trending_now_3", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-1528492835?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-net-worth-surpasses-100-trillion-1528387386?mod=trending_now_2", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthony-bourdain-cnn-tv-host-is-found-dead-1528458689?mod=trending_now_1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cme group inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitstamp", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-09T00:41:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19e5edbc923f87c081bdc9282ab523360cd5be5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvMxRMhSk604ydI0z8HLTbo1DT5Mep2QfP8CO7wN1VHcWx18.5fD_jxqCQQquRZpmF1k8XmW9fZqZI.OPSwMiJht6pOei6YQcKvF4ASqzQbkuSZCMqM8glI8rLKR1MEmDP", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/news/forex-economy/cryptocurrencies/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Markets : News, Economy &amp; Forex, Cryptocurrencies - 4-traders.com", "title": "DPW : Marks Milestone, Reduces Debt Leveraging Bitcoin", "title_full": "DPW : Marks Milestone, Reduces Debt Leveraging Bitcoin | 4-Traders", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.083, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19e5edbc923f87c081bdc9282ab523360cd5be5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvMxRMhSk604ydI0z8HLTbo1DT5Mep2QfP8CO7wN1VHcWx18.5fD_jxqCQQquRZpmF1k8XmW9fZqZI.OPSwMiJht6pOei6YQcKvF4ASqzQbkuSZCMqM8glI8rLKR1MEmDP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "DPW : Marks Milestone, Reduces Debt Leveraging Bitcoin", "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, CA , June 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc. , or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 . DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide.\n“We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault\nemphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.” ABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.\nHeadquartered in Newport Beach, CA , DPW Holdings, Inc.

Volatility has declined since the beginning of the week, as BTC/USD has been largely trading in this range for the past seven days. BTC/USD also struggled to move past the $7,700 price point earlier today. BTC/USD Holds Support At $7,550\nFor most of Friday morning, Bitcoin price stayed steady in the $7,550-$7,650 range, with the lower limit being its major support level. Bitcoin has been trading in an increasingly narrow range for the past week, and volatility is on the decline. In fact, Bitcoin price volatility hasn’t been this low since last October.\nFor the past two weeks, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to the $7,000-$8,000 range, hinting that the market is being very cautious at the moment. However, a long period of quiet action might be a precursor to more violent breakouts in the future, especially in the erratic crypto market.\nBTC/USD is currently on a bullish run to test a resistance of $7,700 again. On the upside, a break above that could send Bitcoin to another $100 increment toward the pivotal $7,800 level. On the downside, a reversal may take BTC/USD down to a retracement level of $7,500. Source: Tradingview\nThe technicals chart indicates that buyers are currently winning the battle. The MACD indicator is showing a bullish signal, while the RSI puts Bitcoin in overbought territory. It’s more likely that BTC/USD could stay above $7,600 for the short term. A close above that is important for the upside action.

Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet Still Don’t like Bitcoin June 7, 2018\nIn what might be the most shocking revelation of the year, it turns out that Warren Buffet and Jamie Dimon still don’t like the world’s most popular digital currency, Bitcoin.\nThe two recorded an interview with CNBC yesterday in which they once again outlined their stance. Jamie Dimon on Bitcoin: “Just Beware”\nThe two staunch Bitcoin critics appeared on CNBC’s ‘ Squawk Box .’ Naturally, being both united in their dismissal of cryptocurrency, it wasn’t long before the subject was raised.\nDespite having plenty to say about Bitcoin on several previous occasions, Dimon told the reporter:\n“I don’t want to be a Bitcoin spokesperson.”\nFortunately, there is absolutely no risk of this being the case since the JPMorgan CEO represents exactly what many members of the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency community despise – centralised finance. Dimon then added a somewhat cryptic warning to those involved in the space:\n“Just beware.”\nDimon famously enraged fans of digital currency last September when he senselessly referred to Bitcoin as a ‘fraud”. He has also stated that he would fire any of his employees that were found to be trading Bitcoin. It was later discovered that JPMorgan was one of the most active buyers of a Bitcoin tracker fund called Bitcoin XBT. He was subsequently accused of market abuse, as we reported last year.\nIn January, Dimon said that he regretted saying what he had about Bitcoin because it was all that people wanted to talk to him about. Clearly, he’s ready to hear more about why the public think he’s entirely wrong about Bitcoin as he is once again openly discussing it.\nAt one point during the interview recorded yesterday, the reporter put the question to her guests, “which of you hates Bitcoin more?” The reply from Warren Buffet was:\n“I set a high standard, I don’t know whether Jamie can top me.”\nBuffet is certainly more creative than Dimon when it comes to badmouthing Bitcoin. His famous outburst about the digital currency was to state that it was ‘probably rat poison squared.’\nIn response to this, a Bitcoin mining firm claimed to have installed a billboard across the road from Buffet’s offices. The message it conveyed was:\n“Warren: You said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you’re wrong about Bitcoin?”\nThe Berkshire Hathaway CEO also appeared on a CNBC segment last month. He was joined by fellow Bitcoin naysayers Charlie Munger and Bill Gates. During this interview the 87-year-old billionaire stated:\n“If people react when you criticise their investment, if they get mad, they’re gambling… If they really like what they own, what difference would it make? If I criticise their wife or something, they don’t get all upset about it [laughs].” Featured image from Shutterstock.

Update 2017) rise has received the bulk of recent press attention with a lot of discussion around whether or not it’s a bubble waiting to burst. However, most the coverage has missed out one of the more interesting and unintended consequences of this price increase.\nThat is the surge in global electricity consumption used to “mine” more bitcoins. According to digiconomist’s bitcoin energy consumption index, as of monday, november 20th, 2017 bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at 29.05TWh. That’s the equivalent of 0.13% of total global electricity consumption. Bitcoin price\nBitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries. More than ireland or nigeria.\nIf bitcoin miners were a country they’d rank 61st in the world in terms of electricity consumption.\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2009. It is designed to not be controlled by any one party and is underpinned by a system called blockchain, which records transactions. To ensure transactions are not falsified or records of ownership changed, participants of the bitcoin network must sign off on transactions in “blocks” (hence, blockchain).\nTo incentivize people to do this work, which involves computers completing complex cryptographic problems, people who verify blocks are rewarded with freshly created bitcoin. Hence, this process is known as bitcoin “mining.”\nHere are a few other interesting facts about bitcoin mining and electricity consumption:\nbitcoin price\n• in the past month alone, bitcoin mining electricity consumption is estimated to have increased by 29.98%\n• if it keeps increasing at this rate, bitcoin mining will consume all the world’s electricity by february 2020.\n• estimated annualized global mining revenues: $7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)\n• estimated global mining costs: $1.5 billion USD (£1.1 billion)\n• number of americans who could be powered by bitcoin mining: 2.4 million (more than the population of houston)\n• number of britons who could be powered by bitcoin mining: 6.1 million (more than the population of birmingham, leeds, sheffield, manchester, bradford, liverpool, bristol, croydon, coventry, leicester nottingham combined) or scotland, wales or northern ireland.\n• bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than 12 US states (alaska, hawaii, idaho, maine, montana, new hampshire, new mexico, north dakota, rhode island, south dakota, vermont and wyoming)\nbitcoin price\nBitcoin mining electricity consumption vs countries\nThe map below shows how much more or less bitcoin mining energy consumption compares to each countries energy usage with 100% being equal.\nIreland currently consumes an estimated 25 twh of electricity per year, so global bitcoin mining consumption is 116%, or 16% more than they consume. The UK consumes an estimated 309 twh of electricity per year so global bitcoin mining consumption is only equivalent to 9.4% of the UK total.\nThe map below shows which countries in europe consume more or less electricity than bitcoin mining:\nAs mentioned, above the data for bitcoin mining energy consumption comes from the bitcoin energy consumption index. You can read about their assumptions here.\nBalkan countries consume less than the electricity consumed for by global bitcoin mining! Bitcoin price\nLooking at the map, one can see the growing trend and energy consumption in all of the balkans, including kosovo, albania, macedonia, serbia, croatia, etc.\nAccording to the table by powercompare.Co.Uk, bitcoin mining consumption relative to country’s use, is over 1000% in kosovo, over 400% in macedonia, over 100% in serbia, etc.\nBitcoin mining is currently consuming 0.13% of the world’s electricity output, it’s growing incredibly quickly.\nElectricity consumption data mostly comes from the CIA via wikipedia and is mostly for 2014, since that’s the most recent year available. Unlike some other sources it includes, residential, commercial and industrial use, so may be higher than other figures quoted elsewhere.\nThe bitcoin energy consumption index estimates consumption has increased by 29.98% over the past month. Bitcoin price if that growth rate were to continue, and countries did not add any new power generating capacity, bitcoin mining would:\n• be greater than UK electricity consumption by october 2018 (309 twh)\n• be greater than US electricity consumption by july 2019 (3,913 twh)\n• consume all the world’s electricity by february 2020. (21,776 twh)\nThe cost of mining bitcoins\nThe bitcoin energy consumption index estimates that the total annual cost of mining bitcoins stands at $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion).\nOn the other hand, to put the energy consumed by the bitcoin network into perspective we can compare it to another payment system like VISA for example. Even though the available information on VISA’s energy consumption is limited, we can establish that the data centers that process VISA’s transactions consume energy equal to that of 50,000 U.S. Bitcoin price households. We also know VISA processed 82.3 billion transactions in 2016. With the help of these numbers, it is possible to compare both networks and show that bitcoin is extremely more energy intensive per transaction than VISA.

R3’s Finances Laughable\nR3 which started off in a promising position in 2014 when it launched as an invitation-only consortium providing blockchain based services to major banks is reported to be in trouble. With early members like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, they quickly added dozens of more partners to their roster. The smooth start soon encountered some turbulence though and in 2016 Goldman Sachs pulled out of the organization.\nLast year in May R3 reportedly raised $107 million in funds and hinted that it was a first round and that they were aiming at raising another $107 million in a second tranche as the consortium was being built out. The company is in financial trouble despite having recently raised another $15 million from a group of three financial sector investors according to the former employees who say that even the initial $107 million round of funding is questionable.\nThe dispute over the $107 million figure stems from one employee saying that it includes fees taken in before the funding round. Fortune confirmed that with the company which conceded it had only raised $98.2 million in new money at the time. The former employee who asked Fortune for anonymity in order to maintain working relationships went further saying that the company’s internal revenue estimates are “laughably off” and perhaps “10x short”.\nManaging director Charlie Cooper disputes all these claims and told fortune that the company had exceeded its revenue goals for 2017 and would update all of their financials at the end of this year. Corporate Culture of Excess\nThe former employees point to a corporate culture of excess as a source for some of R3’s financial problems. Saying that executives traveled frequently in first and business class to meetings that could have been taken online and that company had expanded beyond their needs, one of the informants is quoted in the article saying,\n“Just look at the public information. You see their hiring plan and the number of people on their website, There’s also expensive real estate in London and New York.”\nAnother source of contention is CEO David Rutter’s salary which one former staffer described as “ outrageous “. Though the company would not provide a figure they did respond to Forbes saying “ David’s salary is commensurate with market rates for a leadership position and was approved by the board ,”\nQuestions about R3’s viability go beyond its financial struggles as the company struggles to attract developers to build out its Corda software. Corda is being developed as an open-source platform that the company claims to have 350 contributors to and 50 developers producing the code. There is also an enterprise version of Corda which includes commercial extensions to the open source version.\nThere is some financial hope for R3 in the form of a lawsuit it is engaged in with the cryptocurrency company Ripple over services that R3 purportedly provided, which Ripple contends they didn’t. The suit is for 5 billion XRP tokens worth approximately $3 billion dollars. A settlement is expected before the case reaches trial.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blockch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T14:19:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22a26f9142fbe289e6c5dc993df909eff587e133", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVHLoLEIzEz7qz4rtfP7bX.mCQ5PF4zd8Qmks73JyzDttUcCBhDDJm7xdmnmKY8_iyDn6QSHMpRgCmlhpvAZivsarUGeNtwkC9WNdShiaFTn8-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Switzerland Shows the Way: Bank First to Offer Crypto Business Accounts - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Switzerland Shows the Way: Bank First to Offer Crypto Business Accounts - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.99, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/swiss-bank-fea.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22a26f9142fbe289e6c5dc993df909eff587e133", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVHLoLEIzEz7qz4rtfP7bX.mCQ5PF4zd8Qmks73JyzDttUcCBhDDJm7xdmnmKY8_iyDn6QSHMpRgCmlhpvAZivsarUGeNtwkC9WNdShiaFTn8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "C.

Long viewed as a progressive society way ahead of its time, the Swiss are once again leading, … this time it’s doing so in the crypto revolution.\nAlso read: Fidelity Investments Hints at Entering Cryptocurrency Exchange Space 150 Year Old Bank in Switzerland Opens to Crypto Businesses\nSwitzerland’s mortgage bank Hypothekarbank Lenzburg CEO Marianne Wildi explained, “As a bank that sets itself up technologically and pursues a cooperative strategy in the field of fintech, it is also a matter of credibility to work together with the young sector of crypto and blockchain companies in Switzerland.” Its earliest iteration can be traced back 150 years, and has since morphed into a mortgage, retail, and a private banking services provider, acting locally while being publicly listed. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg CEO Marianne Wildi\nThe Swiss were among the earliest to really see crypto’s potential, becoming a mecca for those interested in the technology and incubating startups along the way. As a rival to the US’s Silicon Valley, an area in Zug has been deemed Crypto Valley for its broad enthusiasm of the phenomenon. Even so, in announcing its new policy Hypothekarbank Lenzburg is the country’s first bank to welcome crypto businesses.\nRegional media quoted Ms. Wildi as explaining how much thought went into changing their policy, suggesting guidance came from the country’s relatively permissive regulator, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). In perhaps in an effort to assuage board members’ fears, she also was sure to the extensive vetting that goes into accepting crypto businesses as clients. Could be a Trend\nPrior to Hypothekarbank going all in, the financial community dabbled along the edges of crypto-related business support. Falcon Private Bank, for example, made headlines last year by vaguely interacting with “crypto asset management.” Bank Frick of Liechtenstein continues to offer to its customers cold storage and top coin access such as bitcoin cash, bitcoin core, litecoin, ether, and ripple.\nMs. Wildi elaborated on just how their new police would shake out, more or less handing over the task to contractor Geissbühler, Weber & Partner AG. “They already have a lot of cryptographic know-how and analyze customer inquiries about the legal consequences and backgrounds,” she assured. “After due diligence they give us a recommendation, and the decision then follows. It’s true that the customer review process is more involved in such relationships, but it does not make any difference to other customer relationships insofar as compliance processes have to work flawlessly anyway.”\nDo you think more countries will follow Switzerland’s lead?

Furthermore, the AMIA has been successfully promoting the use of digital currencies in Budva and has convinced the neighboring Dukley hotel, Beach Lounge, and Marina to accept BTC.\nAlso Read: Mike Hearn’s Crowdfunding Project Has Been Resurrected — Meet Lighthouse.cash Montenegro Real Estate, and Three Establishments Welcome Cryptocurrency Acceptance\nThree apartments have sold in the region of Budva, Montenegro, a country located in Southeastern Europe. The luxury apartments were located near the coastal area on the Adriatic Sea and the region is well known for its tourism. According to AMIA executive Nila Emilfarba and the Notary Office, the living quarters were sold for approximately 420 BTC. The Dukley Gardens sale is also just part of Budva favoring digital currencies.\nEmilfarba says the sale was the biggest so far for the country and the firm has been persuading merchants in Budva to accept digital currencies. In addition to being able to purchase real estate, Emilfarba and AMIA have also convinced the Beach Lounge restaurant, Dukley hotel, and the Dukley Marina to accept BTC as well.\n“Our company, unlike many who have doubt in cryptocurrency, is the first in the region that started selling real estate for the cryptocurrencies,” explains the AMIA.\nWe acquired brand new clientele — In the world, and especially in Europe, there is only a limited number of real estate that can be bought with BTC. The apartments purchased with BTC were located in The Dukley Gardens but the Beach Lounge restaurant, Dukley hotel, and the Dukley Marina also accept BTC. The Apartment Sales Were Closed Quickly and Witnessed by the Budva Notary Office\nOne of the customers was a 25-year old native from France explained the settlement process was quicker than traditional residential closings. The sale was witnessed by the Budva Notary, Pantović’s Law office, and attorneys from Prelević’s Law. After the official papers were signed and the BTC was transferred the funds were immediately converted to Euros.\nReal estate purchases using cryptocurrency has been a trend that’s been growing in number since early 2017 when digital assets reached all-time price highs. These large transactions have been taking place in Miami, Amsterdam, Dubai, Manhattan and all over the world. With three establishments and real estate being sold for cryptocurrency it looks like Montenegro is becoming a friendly region in regard to the digital asset economy.\nWhat do you think about the three apartments in Budva, Montenegro being sold for BTC and the three establishments accepting the cryptocurrency for services?

The president noted that “by definition” neither Russia, nor any other country could have a national cryptocurrency. Putin also mentioned the saga around Telegram, in the light of seeking “civilized” decisions. Cows and Cryptocurrencies\nFrom potholes to spaceports, the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin usually covers it all. It is hard to imagine there is absolutely no preparation or plot behind the scenes, but one has to admit – four hours of questions can be a grueling challenge for anyone’s concentration and intellectual power.\nPutin sounds adequate on just about any topic, and almost all the time. Well, this year he was unprepared to answer at least one question: “Why is cow meat called ‘beef’?” To his credit, the deputy prime minister for agriculture, Alexey Gordeyev, didn’t know the answer either…\nThis year’s program aired in a redesigned format, touched a bit here and there. And, as with any “rationalization” in a former Soviet, Slavic country, the change was met with a proper dose of criticism.\nAs a new feature of the 2018 “Direct Line” – bloggers and vloggers were allowed to ask questions on behalf of their followers. This is how cryptocurrency came into the spotlight, and this time the president was abreast of developments. No National Crypto, ‘by Definition’\nVlogger Artiom Khokholikov tested Putin with a couple of questions that “all youngsters are interested in” – will Russia have its own cryptocurrency, and if, will it be controlled by the state? Also – does the president think that in the near future cryptocurrency will replace completely the standard fiat money? Starting with the cryptoruble topic, Putin remarked the question was somewhat incorrect. Neither Russia, nor any other country can have their own crypto, “by definition,” he educated the nation. “If we talk about cryptocurrency – this is something that goes beyond national borders,” explained the president.\nTicking another box, Putin mentioned the “so called mining,” which, as he pointed out, is not regulated in Russia. The situation, however, will change soon with the adoption of the new legislation currently under review in the Duma. Then he emphasized authorities in Moscow have a very “accurate” attitude towards the whole crypto subject. Russia Should Consider its Participation\nOf course, the omnipresent talking points of central power were to be expected from the strongman of a strong state. “In the overwhelming majority of countries cryptocurrency is not a means of account. It is partially used in Japan, but in other countries it doesn’t work,” Vladimir Putin said.\nThe president went on to remind of the official position of Russia’s Central Bank that cryptocurrencies cannot be a means of payment or saving, and that digital money is not backed by anything. That means, he stressed, that “We have to treat this very accurately and carefully.”\n“Nevertheless”, Putin changed the tone, “such phenomenon has its place in the world, it is developing! We have to carefully analyze, watch what’s going on, and see at what stage and how we can participate in this process and use it, including by the way, to avoid any restrictions in the sphere of international financial activity.” Putin Suggests ‘Civilized’ Approach to Telegram\nThe Russian head of state touched another topic that concerns the crypto community – the fate of the messaging service Telegram . Prohibition is the easiest way to go, he noted, but also suggested that it’s necessary to seek civilized ways to solve the problem.\nRussian authorities have been trying to block the messenger since April 16, following a decision by the Tagansky District Court of Moscow from April 13. So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful and Telegram has managed to circumvent the imposed restrictions.\nRussian special services claim the app has been used by terrorists and have requested its encryption keys. However, the company founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov has refused to hand them over.\nAccording to Russian media, many members of the local Telegram community have interpreted Putin’s comments as a signal to the country’s telecom regulator, Roskomnadzor , and the Federal Security Service, FSB , to ease the pressure on the messenger.\nDo you think Russia will eventually legalize and adopt cryptocurrencies?

Most people assume this new form of money is something owned only by younger people. Moreover, there is a growing focus on quick flips and even quicker gains. A paradigm shift is taking place in terms of who owns Bitcoin, albeit that doesn’t have to be a bad thing per se. The Bitcoin Hodlers Still Exist\nThere are many different reasons why Bitcoin isn’t a major payment method yet. A lot of early investors are still holding on to their Bitcoin balance in the hopes of seeing the value going up. Late last year, such a major price spike occurred , which caused all kinds of consequences. For the Bitcoin holders, it was a validation of their strategy working first and foremost.\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin price has taken a massive dip throughout early 2018. For the average Bitcoin holder, that is not a positive development. There’s still a very good chance a new Bitcoin all-time high will be reached later this year or in 2019. Not everyone can wait for such a spike, though, as the current volatility makes it a lot easier to score quick profits – or losses.\nWhile there are still plenty of reasons to become a Bitcoin holder, the paradigm is shifting. During last year’s bull run, a lot of long-term holders decided to liquidate assets to those seeking short-term gains. While that is not exactly uncommon, it does show some of the initial belief in Bitcoin may be waning. At the same time, distributing the wealth to more people also indicates Bitcoin is still growing as a currency. The Bitcoin Short-term Speculators\nGiven the current Bitcoin price volatility, speculation has taken center stage again. Although that will only lead to even more volatility down the line, it also shows the interest in cryptocurrency isn’t waning in the slightest. Chainalysis data seems to confirm the average Bitcoin holder is changing. Not the person itself, but the overall mindset associated with speculating on Bitcoin in general.\nMore specifically, the number of long-term holders is virtually the same as short-term speculators. Although there is still a gap between the two sides in favor of long-term holders, that situation can change at any given moment. Whether or not that should be considered to be a bad thing, remains unclear at this time. A transfer of wealth is bound to take place sooner or later, as it is the natural evolution of financial markets.\nIn the short-term, the increasing liquidity of Bitcoin for trading can cause price declines. However, there is only so much volume to be bought up before the situation returns to normal. The coming months will be crucial for the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If the long-term faith remains elusive, things will not necessarily improve anytime soon. Nothing is set in stone at this point, and everything remains subject to change at all times.\nImage from Shutterstock Bitcoin Investor Expectations Shift From Holding to Short-term Gains was last modified: June 8th, 2018 by JP Buntinx ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T16:37:32.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72f8f204c1b65ec331dcb888b74af1ac512e2a78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOOCgehOpDI.P7.C3f66GeR.IZOFtdi40DVFehYBirEeE5ioqM36rgAFPfhlY82tWs8Pc_1IlQsMFI.VLD6Q_71HPEYxXV1Qre", "site_full": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cryptocurrencies Not a Risk to Stability, Russian Study Concludes | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Cryptocurrencies Not a Risk to Stability, Russian Study Concludes | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.284, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_218932498_1600-1068x1068.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72f8f204c1b65ec331dcb888b74af1ac512e2a78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOOCgehOpDI.P7.C3f66GeR.IZOFtdi40DVFehYBirEeE5ioqM36rgAFPfhlY82tWs8Pc_1IlQsMFI.VLD6Q_71HPEYxXV1Qre", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrencies Not a Risk to Stability, Russian Study Concludes | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Cryptocurrencies Not a Risk to Stability, Russian Study Concludes June 8, 2018 | Bitcoins Channel | Shares: 1\nEconomy & Regulation A study has found that despite their volatility, cryptocurrencies do not endanger the financial system and the economy of Russia, as the risks are offset by the highly concentrated ownership of digital assets.

There is a major bullish trend line formed with support at $598 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair may continue to trade in a range before making the next move either above $614 or below $600.\nEthereum price is facing tough resistances against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD needs to gather pace above the $614 level to move further higher. Ethereum Price Resistance\nThere were mostly ranging moves above the $590 level in ETH price against the US Dollar. The price traded above the $615 level recently, but it failed to break the $617 resistance. A high was formed at $617.50 before there was a downside correction. It declined below the $610 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $573 low to $617 high.\nHowever, the decline was protected by the $598-600 support area. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $573 low to $617 high also acted as a support. There is also a major bullish trend line formed with support at $598 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The 100 hourly simple moving average is also positioned near the $598 level, which is preventing declines. On the upside, the price is facing a key resistance near the $614 level. A break above the stated resistance is needed for buyers to gain traction above the $620 level.\nLooking at the chart , the price is currently trading in a range and eyeing the next break above $614. On the flip side, if there is a downside break, the price may perhaps decline back towards the $590 and $585 levels in the near term.\nHourly MACD – The MACD is slightly placed in a bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI is currently just below the 50 level with a minor bearish angle.\nMajor Support Level – $598 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T10:38:38.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81a32de483fb199c113f09a1a4e81e26d21a92a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9TfwqaG2jl5G9ItffM.3DML_OYyJL6aPrmJrftnIVp82LLcb.6gPjgxBfIlnWUoxvAAdsDjzX34GmqLD2e6UTLs6zZiqmhxthfT7CBHy2c7zwL", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "BookiePro Launches Public Beta with Five-Bitcoin Prize Fund for World Cup", "title_full": "BookiePro Launches Public Beta with Five-Bitcoin Prize Fund for World Cup", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bookie.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81a32de483fb199c113f09a1a4e81e26d21a92a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9TfwqaG2jl5G9ItffM.3DML_OYyJL6aPrmJrftnIVp82LLcb.6gPjgxBfIlnWUoxvAAdsDjzX34GmqLD2e6UTLs6zZiqmhxthfT7CBHy2c7zwL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BookiePro Launches Public Beta with Five-Bitcoin Prize Fund for World Cup", "text": "BookiePro Launches Public Beta with Five-Bitcoin Prize Fund for World Cup Advertisement This is a paid-for submitted press release.

The Ripple CEO explained that a primary reason for Bitcoin not becoming a global cryptocurrency is due to its transaction times. June 8, 2018, 8:47 am\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse threw a little shade at Bitcoin recently where he stated that Bitcoin was not the “panacea” that people expected it to be .\nThe rise of Bitcoin has led to a vast proliferation of other cryptocurrencies. Between the major coins, there is some fierce competition as developers work to reduce transaction times and fees. San Francisco-based Ripple has their own blockchain network, but unlike other cryptocurrencies, they’re willing to work with centralized banks and other financial institutions. Ripple Throwing Some Shade\nAt the recent Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse talked to CNBC about several topics. He predicted that dozens of banks would be using XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, in 2019 to make cross-border payments.\nGarlinghouse also brought up Bitcoin and its eventual role in the global economy. While he believes that Bitcoin will have a role, it will not become a global cryptocurrency. He said the following to CNBC:\nI think it’s (bitcoin) not going to be the panacea that people once thought it would be, where it would solve all of these different kind of problems… Instead, you’re seeing specializations of different kind of ledgers, different kinds of blockchains.\nThe Ripple CEO explained that a primary reason for Bitcoin not becoming a global cryptocurrency is due to its transaction times. He says that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quite slow” in processing transactions. Blockchain.info notes that today’s average BTC transaction is 20 minutes. By contrast, Garlinghouse notes that the average XRP transaction is 4 seconds. Not a Competition\nDespite Garlinghouse throwing shade at Bitcoin, he says that XRP and BTC are not rivals. He notes:\nWell, I don’t really think about it as one versus the other. I mean, it’s actually unfortunate, I think, that there’s some people in this, the crypto space, the blockchain space — for them, it’s almost a holy war of one versus the other. I don’t look at that at all.\nIn fact, Brad Garlinghouse believes that there will be “many winners” in the cryptocurrency space. He also believes that, eventually, Bitcoin will not be influencing the prices of other cryptocurrencies. He thinks this event will happen once people realize that there are key differences between various digital currencies.\nAs of now, Ripple (XRP) is trading at $0.67, an increase of 0.22% in the last 24 hours, and Bitcoin is trading for $7,666, a 0.1 percent increase in the last 24 hours. 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T14:08:20.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58bb361f75941daf3d1e1e0960dfbcafc1b6848c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAWJouiDLBPTEIKOg43k2J_TG9x55vYxOc16WcEZy62l73IU3V8il53EYlXPZ1LpoCI50QwxMFCeUWSBDTIfROX.", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/04/17062358/techanalysis-btc3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58bb361f75941daf3d1e1e0960dfbcafc1b6848c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAWJouiDLBPTEIKOg43k2J_TG9x55vYxOc16WcEZy62l73IU3V8il53EYlXPZ1LpoCI50QwxMFCeUWSBDTIfROX.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming Sarah Jenn | June 8, 2018 | 7:10 am Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming Sarah Jenn | June 8, 2018 | 7:10 am\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price has formed higher lows and found resistance at the $7,700 level to create an ascending triangle. Price is testing the top of the triangle and might be due for a move back to support. Technical indicators are suggesting that support might continue to hold and lead to another bounce to the top.\nBitcoin price is consolidating inside an ascending triangle pattern and is testing the top.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the rally is more likely to resume than to reverse or that support is more likely to hold than to break.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential downward crossover, indicating weakening bullish momentum. For now, both moving averages might keep holding as dynamic support just above the bottom of the triangle.\nRSI is heading lower but looks ready to move back up, reflecting a return in bullish pressure. Stochastic, on the other hand, continues to slide and signal that sellers still have the upper hand.\nA break below support could mean a move of the same height as the triangle, which spans $7,000 to $7,700. Similarly a break past the top could spur a rally of the same size. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin has been rejected at the $7,700 key area for a few times already, indicating that buyers are not quite confident enough to push price past that level yet. For now, there have been no major updates in the industry, although there have been some factors keeping the cryptocurrency supported.\nFor one, the ongoing crisis in Venezuela led to strong volumes in bitcoin versus the local currency, which is rapidly losing value to hyperinflation. Citizens are turning to bitcoin as an alternative financing or investment, which could keep activity supported while the crisis goes on.

Due to the confidentiality of the information, Lore could not fully disclose which Universities were doing so. The investments are small and into the various cryptocurrency hedge funds available. John Lore, the founder of Capital Fund Law Group, told Business Insider the following with respect to Universities showing an interest in Crypto investing: We’re seeing some academic institutions getting involved on a limited basis for strategic reasons. I can’t say the names of [the academic institutions] because that’s attorney-client but we have people mostly on the East Coast that have begun doing investments in this space on a fairly modest basis… We see academia as a tie between these somewhat young and enthusiastic fund managers and capital raising. His Law group specializes in providing legal services to the hedge fund industry and has advised approximately 30 crypto based hedge funds in the last year or so. According to Lore, the new hedge funds get a majority of their investments from high net individuals. The investments are of limited value and magnitude. This might be because the crypto-markets have proven to being volatile for the past few months. Lore added that: Yes there are investors but at this point, investors are putting in very small percentages of their net worth as we would expect and as I believe is appropriate. Institutional investors and high net individuals have been showing cautious interest towards investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies for both are new industries with little or no regulation. The decentralized aspect of the whole crypto-verse might be the reason for their reluctance to jump on board. Also, perhaps being accustomed to ‘business as usual’ of investing has left them with doubts about crypto and blockchain. New technology is usually treated with caution as was the case with the internet back in the 80s and 90s. But with many investment experts advising that Bitcoin is screaming ‘Buy Right Now’ , the cautious institutional investors and high net individuals might be gradually warming up to the new investment industry of crypto. Current market analysis indicate that Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $7,657 at the moment of writing this. BTC deviation from this level has only seen a 0.7% decrement in the last 24 hours indicating some much needed stability in the crypto-markets as we head into the weekend.

At the start of the year, the consensus was that the number one cryptocurrency would reach even greater heights. However, BTC prices have declined from its record-setting highs of $19,500 in mid-December 2017 to hovering around the $7,700 mark. Bitcoin will Approach the $15,000 Mark by December 2018\nFinder, a financial comparison platform, released a Bitcoin forecast that said BTC prices would cross the $30,000 mark by December 2018. Six months into the year, the platform seems to have revised its predictions with a new report released in June. According to the latest forecast figures, Bitcoin will end the year trading at $14,638. This new figure predicts an almost 100 percent increase in BTC price based on its current trading value.\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction panel consists of 10 members with experience in the digital currency and blockchain industry. The figures published by Finder are an extrapolation of the individual predictions of each panelist. Examining the figures published by Finder, the lowest end-of-year BTC price prediction was $5,778 while the highest was $25,000. Some of the members of the panel include James Lynch of Castlecoin, Aaron LePoidevin of Every Capital, and Kunal Patel of the Gerson Lehman Group.\nSpeaking to The Independent , David Hanson, CEO of Ultra, said that he expected Bitcoin to continue hovering between $6,500 and $8,500. According to Fundstrat analyst, Robert Sluymer , Bitcoin’s bottom price is $7,000. Thus, with an influx of institutional investors, the price of BTC is expected to increase. Many experts and commentators share this notion that the entry of institutional investors into the market will drive up prices. In 2018, people like Tom Lee, also of Fundstrat, Dan Morehead (Pantera CEO), and Iqbal Gandham of eToro have expressed similar views. EOS to See the Highest Gains\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction survey highlighted EOS as the cryptocurrency to watch. The results of the survey indicate a predicted price of $38.25 at the end of the year. Based on the current value of Eos tokens, this price estimate is a 200 percent increase. According to Hanson, EOS is generating a great deal of interest in the market, especially with the hype surrounding its mainnet launch. In a recent Weiss rating report , EOS was also identified as one of the best altcoins in the market.\nHow accurate do you think these predictions are?
