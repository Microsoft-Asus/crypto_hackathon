Moreover, while volatility is great for traders, it impedes mainstream adoption.\nCboe data shows that despite last week's pop in volatility, the trend is heading south.\n\"From a volatility standpoint, the overall trend is certainly lower, but in contradiction to that trend, last week was the most volatile for lead-month futures since the middle of April,\" wrote Peter Lusk, senior instructor for The Options Institute at the Cboe.\n\"Since the start of trading of the futures at Cboe in December, the average weekly XBT volatility has been 21.7% (through May 18).

The cryptocurrencies were seized from a platform that had 30,000 users and is the highest sale of seized Bitcoin in Germany. ‘Emergency Sale’ Due to Volatility\nThe amount of Bitcoin was sold over two months from February 20 in an emergency sale due to the high volatility that affects the cryptocurrency markets. In total, 1,312 Bitcoins (BTC) were sold alongside 1,399 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 1,312 Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and 220 Ether (ETH). The coins were sold on a German-based trading platform and involved more than 1,600 transactions.\nState prosecutors said : “Since all cryptocurrencies are exposed to the risk of high price fluctuations or even total loss, an emergency sale was ordered by the Central Office of Cybercrime Bavaria.”\nThe price of Bitcoin has fluctuated from near $20,000 to $6,500 over the past six months. On February 20, Bitcoin was worth around $11,500 and was down to $8,400 by April 20, around the time the final coins were sold. NewsBTC reports that Bitcoin is in a bearish trend and is hitting a crucial point of support, which it needs to remain above in order to prevent further mid-year lows. This is the third time this year that Bitcoin has tested this support.\nThe cryptocurrency was seized from the LuL.to portal which illegally offered more than 200,000 e-books and audiobooks for sale. This platform was used by more than 30,000 people. In June, investigators from the Cyber Crime Competence Center of the LKA Sachsen and the Central Office of Cybercrime Bavaria (ZCB) arrested the alleged operators and stopped the site from operating.\nThe investigators were able to access the cryptocurrencies after the officials decided to cooperate. Unlike funds held in bank accounts which can be accessed by police in such cases, cryptocurrencies cannot be accessed unless the investigator has the private key. A study by Chainalysis highlighted that almost a quarter of Bitcoins in current circulation may be lost forever due to factors including users losing their private keys.\nThe next biggest sale in Germany was by Hessian Internet Investigators in collaboration with the FBI and Europol. These proceeds were from popular dark net sites including Silk Road 2.0 and Hydra. At the time of the sale, the Bitcoins were worth €1.9 million ($2.2 million), up from €50,000 ($58,000) when they were taken. These were also sold as an emergency sale as Bitcoin is deemed by the German authorities as a perishable good with a value could, in theory, reduce to zero. This type of sale is otherwise used for confiscated food or cars that could lose value over time.\nPreviously, the German authorities in Leipzig sold 1,197 Bitcoins netting them €432,000 ($500,000). These were taken from the Shiny Flakes platform and would be worth €7.6 million ($8.8 million). In Bulgaria, authorities are sitting on 213,519 Bitcoins, worth $1.5 billion.\nIn November, NewsBTC reported that this would have been able to pay off a fifth of their national debt. The money was seized in May 2017 in response to a large number of cases of customs fraud where 23 arrests were made after police searched more than 100 properties. This included five Bulgarian customs officials. Featured image from Shutterstock.

It is aimed at getting people to talk about these problems and solutions if any.\nA 51% attack refers to when a miner or miners with over 50% of the blockchains processing power take control of the network. Nodes on proof of work cryptocurrencies recognize the blockchain with the most hashing power as the correct version of history. This can lead to attacks where the attacker is able to double spend cryptocurrencies, as seen earlier this week on Bitcoin Gold [BTG]. Source: crypto51.app\nThe site aggregates hashing power data from the website ‘Mine the Coin’, and coin prices from CoinMarketCap. The cost required to mount a 51% attack is calculated by using hashpower rental service from Nicehash’s rental pricing.\nThe price does not include the block reward gained by the attacker for creating new blocks as long as they attack, which may further decrease the price for the attack.\nThe solutions for this problem include implementing a Proof of Stake protocol for the blockchain, and building coins on top of other blockchains, such as the ERC20 protocol for coins on the Ethereum network.\nThe least secure coins listed on the website include famed privacy-centric coin Bitcoin Private [BTCP] which costs a grand total of $778 to 51% attack for one hour. This raises obvious security concerns. The coin is also endorsed by John McAfee , raising awareness about the coin and adding to the risk.\nJackson Palmer comments on Twitter:\n“It would cost just $915 to 51% attack Bitcoin Private right now. Ticking time bomb.”\nA crypto analyst questions Palmer about the 51% attack:\n“This begs the question, why haven’t more 51% attacks occurred?”\nTo which, Palmer replies:\n“Perhaps because the only incentive is malice? I’m not sure if you can effectively short some of these smaller currencies, and they’re on hardly any exchanges so double spending to turn a profit seems minimal. I guess you’d have to go a level deeper and calculate ROI on attack.”\nAnother non-secure coin is Bitcoin Gold [BTG]. It was recently 51% attacked, with losses to the tune of around $18 million. It costs around $3858 to 51% attack on BTG.\nInfamous altcoin Bytecoin [BCN], plagued by meteoric rises and scam accusations, is sitting at a grand total of $557. This is at one of the lowest for the well-known coins on the list.\nOther unsafe coins include GameCredits [GAME], Ubiq [UBQ], Gulden [NLG], and Einsteinium [EMC2], at costs of $515, $470, $113, and $77 respectively. .

We cover these opinions in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Of course, positive predictions are almost always balanced by some negative expectations; in this case they are part of a short-term prognosis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints McAfee Sees Bitcoin Beyond $15,000 in June\nSoon after tweeting that “institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” cybersecurity guru John McAfee issued another bullish prediction. Focusing on short term analysis this time, which he admits is not his favorite, he turns attention to several events that may influence the cryptocurrency market – which, in his words, “will turn before June 12.”\nAccording to McAfee , the “Korea deal is done and Trump will sign the documents in Singapore on 12 June […] The various noises being made are propaganda for domestic consumption,” he notes. After Singapore, the software businessman expects a visit by the US President to Japan, where “talks on creating a gold backed US currency will commence.”\nBitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicts. His post also features several altcoins like golem, docademic, bezop, bitcoin private, and EOS. McAfee, who is a known supporter of cryptocurrencies and their adoption, has previously stated that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million per coin by the end of 2020.\nIn recently recorded video , the internet security expert also talks about “the war we are all engaged in.” The banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto, in his judgement. In a rather calm tone, McAfee advises crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. John McAfee calls on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” Bitcoin Still a Buy, Good for Store of Value\nMcAfee is not alone in the optimists’ camp. According to blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart, bitcoin is still worth buying, despite its continued losses. The increased number of use cases is a proof that BTC is becoming more institutionalized, he told CNBC . “Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,” Bogart said, noting that banks are either going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform, or are opening up a trading desk. Spencer Bogart advised investors to sell coins like cardano, tron, IOTA and NEO, but said they should hold cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum, ripple, and EOS.\nAccording to Matt Hougan, Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, the most compelling use case for bitcoin today is as a store of value, although he admits the idea is often dismissed because of the volatility of the cryptocurrency. “Gold is solid. Bitcoin is volatile. It’ll never work – these statements are ignorant of gold’s history and devoid of imagination,” Hougan recently wrote in an op-ed piece for Forbes .\n“Before 1971, the US dollar was hard-backed by gold, and gold’s value was effectively vouchsafed by the full faith and credit of our government. When Richard Nixon took the US off of the gold standard, it set gold loose from its moorings,” Matt Hougan explains. “What followed was a period of huge volatility, as gold fought to establish itself as an independent store of wealth. In 1974, for instance, gold bullion prices rose 73%, before falling 24% in 1975. In 1981, gold lost 33% of its value, after being up 121% just two years prior,” he details. Russian Experts Expect Further Decline in Prices\nCrypto experts contacted by Russian media are not so optimistic, at least in the short run. The value of bitcoin core (BTC) will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold, they claim. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $7,450, while bitcoin cash (BCH) holds over $900.\nThe downward trend is largely due to decisions and statements made by regulators in a number of countries, points out Vladislav Antonov, analyst at Alpari. Several factors have caused the weakening of bitcoin, according to the expert. Recently, the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into supposed price manipulations in the cryptocurrency markets. News came out that authorities in India may impose 18 percent tax on crypto trading.\nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , Antonov also mentioned the crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects and suspicious crypto activities, part of the coordinated “ Operation Crypto-Sweep ” in North America. Another event that has influenced the prices is the expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25th.\nIgor Zartdinov, co-founder of the ICG crypto fund, says the decrease in the value of bitcoin occurs on a neutral-to-positive news background. He thinks that market manipulation is a possible explanation, as big players usually earn at the expense of small investors. “That’s what we are seeing now,” Zartdinov believes.\nWhat are your predictions about the future of crypto markets?

The markets seemingly recover, although there is no real reason for this development. Some speculators point at Italy’s political uncertainty making cryptocurrency look far more appealing. It is evident Bitcoin can thrive when financial turmoil becomes more apparent.\nThe year 2018 hasn’t been overly kind to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A lot of currencies lost nearly half of their value or more since late 2017. It now seems big gains are looming on the horizon all of a sudden. No one knows why this is happening, which allows for a fair bit of speculation. A new Bitcoin Price Rally is Forming\nOne potential reason is the ongoing turmoil in Italy. The European nation has struggled financially for several years now. Earlier today, the country shook up the European financial sector yet again. Moreover, the Italian government is threatening to leave the Eurozone.\nWhether or not this influences the cryptocurrency markets, is a mystery. It is evident the Eurozone has been on the brink of collapse for some time now. If the Euro were to disappear, a new global currency needs to rise up. Bitcoin still fits that picture far better than any traditional currency or asset.\nHow all of this will play out, remains to be seen. Italy’s uneasy situation has been known for some time now. Bitcoin’s price hasn’t correlated with most of these developments to date. Even so, any catalyst to spark a new cryptocurrency frenzy will be welcomed with open arms. A very peculiar and interesting situation to keep an eye on.\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T01:25:52.087+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e42174ebaaeb2f9e51f2cbbc325aacfe0e524e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3qiaDCz7a0uFb99QCI_kTs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

Since then, BTC has recovered to $7,450, but regardless of the newly formed optimism in the market, it is still too early to conclude the start of a new bull market. Weak Volume\nAs CCN reported throughout late May, analysts expect the bitcoin price to fall below the $7,000 mark in the near future before rebounding to its mid-term support levels at $10,000 and $12,000. On May 29, BTC came close to reaching below the $7,000 mark as it dropped to $7,040.\nOver the past few hours, BTC rebounded relatively quickly from $7,050 to $7,450, but its short-term corrective rally is not convincing enough based on its volume and price trend to conclude that a new bull rally is forming.\nOne respected bitcoin technical analyst wrote:\n“Recent price action has taught us that these thin, fast moves up should be treated with some caution. They’re known as liquidity voids and price often, though not always, comes back to fill them in. If price can find support above $7,450 that would suggest a break in market structure & these would be the next logical areas to reach for (shorter-term). If it can’t/fails to close on a higher high, would suggest this thin move was just a stop run of the blue swing high.”\nThe technical analysis of the short-term trend of bitcoin is backed by the shortage of volume over the past 24 hours. The abrupt spike in buy volume which caused BTC to jump by more than $4000 was smaller than the sell volume recorded merely two days ago, demonstrating that the recent price surge of BTC is temporary.\nThe downward trend of bitcoin throughout May has been strong, and it will require a significant bounce from a proper support level for BTC to eye previous levels at $10,000 and $12,000. Investors like Willy Woo see the next major support level at $5,700, while many traders expect BTC to rebound from the lower end of the $6,000 region.\nAs of current, the volume of BTC, which remains just over $5 billion, is not sufficient to initiate a short to mid-term recovery. The trading volume of Tether, a cryptocurrency whose value is hedged to that of the US dollar, is often a good indicator of the short-term state of the market as cryptocurrency traders regularly utilise USDT to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies to the US dollar.\nUSDT’s volume is currently larger than Ethereum and EOS at $2.8 billion and has crossed 50 percent of the volume of BTC, signifying that traders are not confident in the short-term trend of the cryptocurrency market. Where Does the Market go Next?\nDespite the strong performance of bitcoin on May 29, it is likely that the cryptocurrency market will continue to fall until major cryptocurrencies find a strong support level and bottom to bounce off of. For bitcoin, its short-term bottom will likely be the lower end of $6,000, at least in the short-term.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Various studies on this topic have been published over the years. In Chelan County, Washington, a major development is taking place. Rural electric utilities are taking an aggressive stance against various Bitcoin mining firms over their “disruption” of the local power grid. Chelan County Turns on Bitcoin Mining\nOver the past two to three years, various Bitcoin mining firms have set up shop in Washington’s Chelan County . This part of the state has an abundance of renewable energy, and its power grid seems more than capable of supporting large energy draws. While this situation has worked out quite well for several years, local residents are getting fed up with these Bitcoin miners, by the look of things.\nIn fact, a crusade of sorts has been taking place in Chelan County. Rural electric utilities have conducted a hearing regarding the future of these local Bitcoin mining firms. This event took place two weeks ago but only made media headlines over the weekend. There was so much public interest in the hearing that a second room had to be opened so everyone could attend it live.\nChelan County has become increasingly appealing to Bitcoin mining firms due to its access to hydropower. This form of renewable energy allows mining firms to benefit from cheaper power in rather large quantities. As such, multiple companies have set up shop in the county, although a few problems have arisen.\nOne of the primary issues is that there are a lot of farms and other areas previously used for other purposes which have been transformed into Bitcoin mining operations. While this is a positive trend for the cryptocurrency industry, no success goes by unpunished. All three public utilities in Chelan County are determining how best to deal with all of these mining firms. One possible outcome is that they could choose not to increase their energy offerings to these companies, which would hinder the companies’ growth plans.\nWhile the demand for electric power in Chelan County tends to grow each year, the latest increase has been well beyond expectations. Since January of 2017, there has been a demand for 210 megawatts just to power Bitcoin mining operations. This is virtually the same amount as the entire county and its 73,000 residents are using right now. Doubling the electric power output of the region is no easy feat, and it seems the utility providers are looking for ways to avoid having to do so.\nMoreover, there is the problem of how large energy purchases work exactly. Some miners think they can simply talk to an official in order to purchase electricity for their Bitcoin mining operation. That is not how things work in the real world. Furthermore, there are the unusual spikes in power usage which utility crews have to deal with. Bitcoin mining is a booming business in Washington, but it is also causing a lot of problems for the companies delivering the required electricity to miners.

In our latest edition, we look at Hasbro being granted a registered mark for the smell of Play-Doh, a Kenyan lawyer blasting proposed anti-counterfeiting legislation, a UK company obtaining a mark for BITCOIN, and media coverage of trademarks from China linked to Ivanka Trump. Coverage this time from Trevor Little (TL), Tim Lince (TJL), Adam Houldsworth (AH) and Timothy Au (TA). Legal radar:\nKogan faces CATCH AdWords suit – Online retailer Kogan is being accused of violating Australian Consumer Law and misleading consumers by fellow ecommerce organisation Catch Group, which claims its CATCH mark was used on Google AdWords links to attract visitors to Kogan’s ‘catchmobile.com.au’ website. In a statement made to the Australian federal court, the plaintiff also claimed that Kogan had recently registered several other domain names featuring its branding, including ‘catchinsurance.com.au’ and ‘catchloans.com.au’, and alleges that it is passing its platforms off as being affiliated with the Catch Group. Though more details are likely to emerge as the case progresses, it is a reminder that AdWord-related litigation continues to rumble on. (AH)\nHasbro registers the smell of Play-Doh – American multinational toy company Hasbro has been granted a registered trademark by the USPTO for a rare type of non-traditional mark: a smell, specifically of its iconic toy product Play-Doh. In a press release the company described the smell as “a unique scent formed through the combination of a sweet, slightly musky, vanilla fragrance, with slight overtones of cherry, combined with the natural smell of a salted, wheat-based dough”. Jonathan Berkowitz, senior vice president of global marketing for the Play-Doh brand labelled the smell “synonymous with childhood and fun” and that the registered mark will allow the company to “protect an invaluable point of connection between the brand and fans”. (TA)\nUK company registers and enforces BITCOIN trademark – It has been reported that a UK company that obtained a registered trademark for the term “bitcoin” has sent a cease-and-desist letter to a small business owner selling bitcoin-themed shirts on Etsy. The letter requests that the seller stop selling and dealing with the goods in question, as well as any other products that refer to the BITCOIN mark, and notes that failure to do so within 14 days will lead to legal proceedings being brought against them. It is worth noting, though, that the filing is only registered under classes 25, 32 and 33, covering clothing, beers and other non-alcoholic beverages and alcoholic beverages. Unsurprisingly, the mark – and the fact it is being used to enforce against products – has caused outrage in some cryptocurrency communities. For example, the top-voted comment regarding the story on a Bitcoin community on Reddit claimed the applicant is “obviously someone with no morals and with pure greed”, while another argued that ‘Bitcoin’ should be “public domain”. (TA)\nOnePlus in trademark tussle with Amazon over Dash Charge branding – Technology company OnePlus has reportedly dropped the Dash Charge brand, a term used for its fast-charging products, after a trademark challenge from Amazon. According to Android Police , OnePlus sought registered trademark protection for the term in the United States and the EU. The EUIPO denied its application in March following two oppositions, one of which was by Amazon. According to the opposition, Amazon claimed the Dash trademark is “in relation to its Dash Replenishment service, an API that allows developers to set up their internet-connected devices to automatically order items from Amazon”. It appears the phone company isn’t ditching the technology that is the bedrock of the Dash Charge brand. On the contrary, the company’s website in Canada refers to the charging cables as “Fast Charge” (although the UK store still references Dash Charge). So rather than hastily coming up with a new brand and logo, it appears the company may quietly drop the branding and reference its technology in generic terms. (TJL) Market radar:\nIP Australia unveils examiner tools – IP Australia has announced the rollout of a Smart Assessment Toolkit for examiners. The toolkit, which utilises advanced machine learning technology, contains a suite of decision-support tools that are intended to streamline the examination of trademark applications. The toolkit includes a smart search (which automatically compares new plain word trademark applications with earlier registered marks to produce a list of hits based on similarities of goods and services), word analysis (analysing a plain word trademark to identify and match problematic terms) and an ownership module that retrieves and analyses ownership information against other data such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Patricia Kelly, director general, IP Australia, proclaimed: “This is a game changer for trademark examiners. We’re embracing advanced machine learning technology to provide leading-edge tools to our staff and improve our service to customers. This technology helps examiners focus on more complex and value-added tasks, allowing better use of our skilled staff and improved quality of administration.” ( TL )\nSnapDragon “Swoops”– Legal tech company SnapDragon has launched Swoop, an automated brand monitoring platform for designers, manufacturers and retailers. The Swoop software is aimed at companies of all sizes, the company stating that the marketplace policing service’s offering in SaaS (software as a service) format “gives all companies access to a world-class, robust, brand protection strategy”. The online brand protection services industry is a competitive one, and SnapDragon has clearly identified growth in the price-sensitive SME market as it seeks to increase its marketshare. ( TL )\nCorsearch unveils new partnerships at INTA’s annual meeting – Trademark clearance and protection service provider Corsearch has revealed two new partnerships, aimed at boosting its online brand protection offerings. Specifically, the organisation has struck cooperation deals with INCOPRO, an internet IP and brand protection company, and Key-Systems, a major domain name administrator. The former will see Corsearch offer a law firm edition of INCOPRO’s brand protection technology, while the Key-Systems Partnership will allow Corsearch to provide firms an interface to manage the domain portfolios of their clients. With the online space growing in importance from a brand enforcement point of view, Corsearch – like other service providers – is clearly seeking partners with specialist expertise and systems. (AH) Media watch:\nMedia decries Ivanka Trump marks – There were reports over the weekend about trademarks linked to Ivanka Trump, daughter of the US president, that were approved a few days before Donald Trump confirmed that he was reversing policy related to Chinese telecom company ZTE. Some of the articles suggest a possible link between the approval of the marks and Donald Trump’s ZTE move, with the New York Times stating: “Coincidence? Well, probably. Still, the remarkable timing is raising familiar questions about the Trump family’s businesses and its patriarch’s status as commander in chief.” However, experts on the ground doubt there is any direct connection between trademarks owned by Ivanka Trump and the recent actions of the US president. For instance, some commentators have suggested the trademarks were approved more quickly than average – with some of the recently approved marks applied for in March 2017 (with a wait time of “up to 18 months” typical in China). But Laura Young, a trademark lawyer at Wang & Wang, told NY Magazine that quicker registration isn’t unusual for public figures. “When a person is famous, and the examiners say: ‘Oh, I’ve heard of this person,’ it can be decided more quickly than if the examiner is not sure and has to consult others or go to a committee,” Young said. While there are still arguably ethical questions around obtaining the trademarks (specifically around the blurring of Trump’s business and political roles), the suggestion of a direct link between the recent decisions and the ZTE about-face seem tenuous at best. (TJL)\nTop Kenyan trademark lawyer blasts proposed anti-counterfeiting legislation – While remarking that Kenya has become “the Wimbledon Stadium for counterfeiters”, IP lawyer William Maema has voiced in a recent blog how he is unimpressed by the country’s proposed new anti-counterfeiting laws. The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendment) Bill 2018 – which, if passed, will amend Kenya’s 2008 Counterfeit Act – promises to rename the country’s Anti-Counterfeiting Agency to the Anti-Counterfeiting Authority. It also seeks to make it an offence to import any goods bearing a brand that have not been registered with the new authority. Maema describes the change of name “vainglorious” and comments that the proposed amendments will “hurt brand owners more than the counterfeiters it is seeking to rein in”. By creating another layer of brand registration, it would create additional costs for rights holders, and usurping the role of the Kenya Industrial Property Institute by “dilut(ing) the sanctity of trademark registration in Kenya”; he claims that the new requirement would provide a new defence for counterfeiters. (AH) On the move:\nScott J Palmer joins forces with Perkins Coie – International law firm Perkins Coie has announced that Scott J Palmer has joined the IP practice at its Beijing office as a partner. Palmer joins the firm along with James Zimmerman, who will join the business practice. Both attorneys come on board from US law firm Sheppard Mullin and specialise in advising US companies in China. Palmer’s practice focuses on in-bound China IP enforcement matters, especially in relation to trademark, copyright, trade dress, patent and unfair competition matters involving IP. (TA)\nNew Global Head of Intellectual Property – Hogan Lovells has appointed Burkhart Goebel as the new global head of the firm's intellectual property practice. He takes over the role from Andreas von Falck (who has headed the practice since 2003 and will remain at the firm) on July 1 and commented: “The intellectual property of a global brand has never been more critical to business growth, innovation and survival; this is an exciting time to be leading the team and we are grateful to Andreas for his leadership, passion and commitment over the last 15 years.\" ( TL )\nWard joins Thorntons – Scottish IP firm Thorntons has announced the hire of Corinne Ward as a solicitor in the firm’s intellectual property team. She joins from Dentons, and has extensive experience in IP dispute resolution, the commercialisation of IP and drafting contracts. She has also conducted corporate transactions, including the purchase of intellectual property. (TJL) And finally…\nNew free-to-view anti-counterfeiting guide – World Trademark Review is pleased to announce the publication of the 2018 edition of Anti-counterfeiting – A Global Guide , which provides trademark and brand protection professionals with critical guidance on anti-counterfeiting laws, procedures and strategies in key jurisdictions around the world.

He’s lived what most men can only dream as a high class, world renowned escort to wealthy women. More recently, he’s the brain behind Cointext , a revolutionary rebranding of sending crypto without needing an internet connection. If all that wasn’t enough, he’s also something of a compelling philosopher. We caught up with Mr. Armani ahead of his long-form interview on Humans of Bitcoin , an episode that’s quickly become mandatory listening.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt Vin Armani’s Art of Seduction Brought to Bitcoin Cash\nNews.Bitcoin.com : Dude, you’re beefcake. You’ve got ladies. You’re in great shape. You’re a television star. You don’t live in your mom’s basement. What the hell are you doing in crypto? Vin Armani : Ha! The smartest people I know have figured out how much better life is on all fronts with a little time spent in the gym and a little money spent on a good tailor. I never lived in my mom’s basement. That’s probably attributable to my father, a tech entrepreneur, buying me a TI-99 for my 5th birthday (complete with cassette drive) and spurring my love for technology. By the time I was 15, I was already getting myself into unnecessary trouble with hacking and phreaking. When the TV show came along, [Showtime’s Gigolos ] totally out of the blue, in 2010, I was already well into my software development career and I actually had to quit my position at what is now Saatchiart.com (where I’m told much of my code is still in the foundation of their platform) to go to Vegas and film the first season of the show [Showtime’s Gigolos , which ran for six season].\nIt was around that time that a developer buddy passed along a link to some information about Bitcoin. I believe that I first downloaded mining software in 2011, though I didn’t see it as anything more than just novelty at the time. I bought my first bitcoins in December 2012 for $15 each from Julian Tosh, who was running Bitcoinsinvegas.com at the time. When the price went to $1,000 for the first time in 2013, I cashed out, had an awesome Christmas, and I’ve been a vocal proponent ever since. When I started doing The Vin Armani Show in the Fall of 2016, cryptocurrency was a significant part of the show. It’s an even bigger part of the show, and my consciousness, now. Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash\nYou took-on the bitcoin cash versus bitcoin core debate. Your tweets advocating bitcoin cash are increasing. What attracts you to bitcoin cash? Starting in 2014, I began working on some prototypes for various gaming devices that could utilize [bitcoin core (BTC)] as a settlement layer. One example, Ocelot is a mobile slot machine app that interfaces with a paper fiat collecting kiosk. Basically, it allows a player to insert paper cash and receive [BTC] in a wallet integrated into the app. They then use that [BTC] to gamble within the app and can “cash out” back to fiat. Because transactions would confirm, at that time, with miner fees of under 1 cent, I (and several very important gaming industry luminaries in Vegas) thought it could be a game changer.\nAs fees began to go into double digits in cents and then move into the multi-dollar range, I was forced to drop [BTC] as the settlement layer. Same goes for a tipping prototype that I built for Legends Room strip club in Vegas – the first “ Strip Club ICO “. Fees got ridiculous and I lost all confidence in [BTC]. I have personally seen the power and potential of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. That’s where the value has always been for me. When fees got out of control, I began advocating Litecoin and Ethereum, but neither felt as solid as [BTC] had felt to me when I first encountered it and got a chance to develop using the platform. After the fork, as Bitcoin Cash showed itself to be a return to the cryptocurrency I fell in love with, and as I was able to move my projects over to Bitcoin Cash with minimal effort, my excitement for Bitcoin returned. Bitcoin Cash brought me back into the fold. I don’t think I’m alone in that feeling. As I look around the cryptocurrency landscape, the voices and mindsets most aligned with my own are all coming from individuals who have thrown their lot in with Bitcoin Cash. These Are Important Times\nYou’ve said your program, The Vin Armani Show , is an exploration of a whole new way of being. Can you expand on that a bit? Is that just the hubris of our time? What is so different about this time in human history? Every generation probably thinks that they are living in the most important time ever. To a certain extent, that is actually true. I think what is different about the time in which we currently live is substantially different, however. There was a time, at the dawn of our species, where every homosapien on earth could communicate, face-to-face, with every other member of the species. After all, they were members of the same small family. From the time that the first band of our early ancestors separated from that family and set off to find new lands in which to live, humans have existed in distinct pockets.\nOver hundreds of thousands of years, we eventually began to reconnect with our lost relatives. For the first time in human history, since the dawn of our species, every human on the planet really can communicate, in real time, face to face, with every other human. I believe that represents a “reset button” for the species. In fact, it may represent our evolving into a completely new species. Our generation is going to be the one that decides the fate of that species. These are important times.\nLearn more about Mr. Armani’s projects on the latest episode of Humans of Bitcoin , online now.\nDo you think we’re living in unique times?

This has reduced the value of the entire market to US$304 billion according to Coin Market Cap, down a further 1.5% since this morning. Whilst Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have dropped around 2% lower, one of the worst performers has been Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The Bitcoin offshoot is down 5.6% since this time yesterday to US$893.60 per token, reducing its market capitalisation to US$15.3 billion. This means that Bitcoin Cash has now fallen 26% since this time last week or a sizeable 38% in just the space of one month. Why is Bitcoin Cash sinking? There doesn’t appear to be a single catalyst for Bitcoin Cash’s sizeable drop. Instead, a combination of negative trader sentiment, significant selling pressure, and profit taking appear to be weighing on the alt coin’s performance. In respect to the former, recent reports of price manipulation in cryptocurrency markets has hit trader sentiment at a time when it was already very weak. And in respect to the latter, the Bitcoin Cash price rallied strongly last month ahead of its Bitcoin ABC upgrade which increased its block size to 32MB. This allowed it to handle significantly more transactions than many of its peers and was supposed to increase its appeal for real world use. Whilst this could still be the case one day, traders certainly aren’t sticking around to find out. The Bitcoin Cash price is now close to the levels it was before the Bitcoin ABC bump took place. What’s next? Until there is a positive catalyst that leads to an improvement in sentiment, I believe that Bitcoin Cash and its crypto peers will unfortunately continue their decline. In light of this, I would suggest that traders resist the temptation to buy the dip and focus on other opportunities instead.

After nearly tripling from April to May from $632 to $1,818, most of those gains have since evaporated, all but confirming that we are not going to see $4,000 again any time soon. Segwit (BTC) for its part has been a bit less volatile, but the parabolic rise is clearly over. This may not be so great for bitcoin as a speculative asset, it is a good thing for bitcoin as a money.\nWhat makes something a good money, among other things, is its relatively stable value over time relative to most other goods. Without relative stability, a good like bitcoin cannot function as a money, but only as an intermediary to money. People use money, final money, to calculate important things and take accurate measurements of profits and losses. You can’t measure profits and losses in a good whose value fluctuates wildly. And without knowing if you are operating at a profit or a loss, an economy, whether that economy by a single person or a nation, cannot allocate resources properly. The economy breaks down. See Venezuela for reference. The money there does not have a stable value, the economy cannot allocate resources properly, and people die.\nLet’s face it. If bitcoin enthusiasts really tried to treat bitcoin as a full on money and record their transactions in bitcoin terms instead of using bitcoin as an intermediary but ultimately calculating in dollar terms, then their households, companies, or whatever they operate would not function.\nBitcoin appears to now be moving out of the mass recognition phase, The next step is to build the mass adoption phase. In the mass recognition phase, most of the cryptocurrency crowd consisted of speculators looking to make dollars on a quick trade. A lot of them get in and by December we were at the biggest parabola in human history. It appears that the last of the speculators are drifting out of the market, giving up on another parabolic run for now. When they are gone, or at least when they are at a minimum because there will always be some speculators, then the bulk of bitcoin owners will be either long term holders or those who actually use it as it was intended to be used, to buy things.\nNeither long term holders nor those who use bitcoin to actually buy things, will affect the price all that much. That’s why currency values typically don’t move very much, because the vast majority of currency holders are either long term hoarders (savers) or those who use it to buy things. Currency speculators still exist and the price moves a little bit here and there, but it’s basically stable.\nJohn McAfee, one of the world’s most notorious bitcoin fans, came out with an interesting video tweet where he admits that if cryptocurrencies are not used for their intended purpose, then eventually their value will be zero. “They won’t be worth 8 cents. “ The purpose of cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/LSRtkgBHpY\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 27, 2018\nNobody knows where the prices for any cryptocurrency will ultimately settle at once speculators are flushed out and only users and savers are left, but that is what will have to happen if bitcoin or ethereum or any other coin will eventually graduate to money status. If and when it does, the dollar value, or speaking in terms of the ultimate goal—the goods value—of bitcoin will be proportional to the amount of people that use it as money. The more people that use it as money, then by definition the more goods are being offered in exchange for the same number of bitcoin. The value of each bitcoin unit goes up in terms of the goods it can buy, not because people are buying it to trade it at higher nominal values for some other currency for the purpose of selling it, but because more goods are on offer for your bitcoin.\nCould there be another mass recognition phase? After all the 2013 BTC top at $1,150 wasn’t the end of the recognition phase, though it sure looked like it. It’s possible, but I wouldn’t bet on it. The reason I believe the recognition phase is over is that bitcoin isn’t catching a bid in Argentina or Turkey, two countries in the midst of currency crises. Bitcoin is still falling in terms of the peso and the lira. It’s not acting as the hedge against inflation it was designed to be. If cryptocurrencies were going to have another speculative bull run this would be the time for it in these countries, but it’s not happening. In order to fuel the next bull run, we don’t need speculators. We need users, and that could take a long time.\nIt ultimately doesn’t matter where exactly bitcoin bottoms from here in terms of the next phase. It would obviously be more encouraging if support at BTC $6,100 or BCH $600 held, but it might not, and certainly not all cryptocurrencies currently available will survive at all. Some will become worthless. The important thing for the future of blockchain crytpocurrencies is not that all of them or even most of them survive, but that the leaders find a support zone wherever it may be and then start creeping slowly higher as more merchants except cryptocurrencies. Then they will slowly start rising like non-inflatable currencies should behave.\nEven if bitcoin eventually becomes a money and its price movements start behaving more like a currency and less like a penny-stock, there is still that big problem of government. When Western debt starts falling apart (this appears to already be starting in Italy) and bonds and currencies start losing value fast, just as is happening in Turkey and Argentina right now, that’s when governments will come after bitcoin pretty hard, I fear, looking for lost tax revenue or just blaming every owner for money laundering.\nBefore we get there though, the best thing cryptocurrency owners can do for now is use their coins as they were intended, as money, to buy things with them. If you are a believer in this sector, shop at stores, online or brick and mortar, that accept bitcoin, segwit, ethereum, ripple or whatever. If you want to hold a chunk of your coins that’s fine, too. But it seems that the era of bitcoin as a quick trade may be over, and we’ll be all the better for it.

Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it, will be a disrupter to the traditional notions of currency. In the end, currency will be better for it. Edmund Moy, 38th Director of the United States Mint “Where are the bitcoins?” I asked this question in my last story about bitcoins in Second Life (SL) and I still haven’t found any. (Significant Other thinks that it’s very vain of me to quote myself. My retort is who else writes about this stuff but me?) A recent search inworld revealed a few groups that discuss bitcoins purportedly but since many of these were associated with Bitcoin exchanges that had long since closed in SL, I don’t have any hopes of anything going on. I’ve done a fair bit of reading about Bitcoin since my last story. (Anyone who’d like a great reading list just drop me a note!) What I’ve come away with is the question, “Can we use bitcoins in SL?” Before I answer that question, let me restate the problem first. The only alternative currently for economic transactions inworld is Linden Dollars (L$) . Linden Lab (LL) has a monopoly. Also, because of fairly stringent U.S. Treasury regulations on virtual currencies used in games and financial exchanges, LL has incentive to run a tight ship. (Anecdotally, I’ve heard that while Federal penitentiaries are nominally better than state pens, one is best advised to avoid incarceration therein. Again, my knowledge is strictly anecdotal.) If someone tried to use another form of exchange there have been issues with these. Real Life (RL) cash or commodities like gold are impractical. How would exchanges or delivery be made? How would foreign exchange fluctuations be factored in? How would one legally work around LL and US Treasury regulations without spending a fortune on paperwork? Credit cards while addressing some of the functional and regulatory issues noted above have another set of problems. Anonymity and security for starters. Would you give your credit card number blindly inworld to an anonymous resident? (If you would then please look me up. I have a virtual bridge that I’d like to show you!) Then there’s the cost. RL financial institutions charge a fee for each transaction charged to a card payable by the merchant. Which raises another slight problem. How many RL banks or credit card issuers would issue a merchant account (Necessary to conduct credit card transactions.) to an anonymous business inworld. (My guess is that their first phone call after a request like that would be to either the FBI or the Secret Service.) OK, so those are all the traditional RL ways to possibly engage in financial activity inworld. All non-starters. Which brings me back to my original question, “Can we use bitcoins in SL?” The answer could very well be, “Why not?” Once one has obtained a bitcoin wallet in RL, one can use bitcoins. Modifying kiosks or other payment devices in SL to accept bitcoins is a relatively straightforward exercise. (Says a non-programmer.) Multi-signature bitcoin transactions and escrow services could be used to guarantee that all parties complete the transaction before payment is made. Yes, some complexity and if escrow services are used then there would be some cost involved. But, compared to what would be involved with any of the former payment methods that I’ve described, a relatively simple and inexpensive exercise. Bitcoin can be a digital currency used across the Metaverse. Bitcoin is secure and anonymous while eliminating the “play money” step with all the costs and inefficiencies that virtual currencies bring to the table. Bitcoin would be faced with introducing its technology to virtual worlds, gaining adoption by a significant number of parties, and conversion of existing pricing to a one denominated in bitcoins. A few disclaimers. There’s always a few! (Significant Other’s worried that I’ll be responsible for the next Great Recession.) I’m not an attorney. I don’t work with foreign exchanges in RL. I’m advancing a few ideas here that are probably going to be the focus of some debate around the LL Terms of Service (ToS) and US Treasury regulations. (Not to mention all the other governments in the world.) Income earned inworld would still be subject to taxation. I haven’t a clue how this would all work! But, it’s a great discussion to have, isn’t it? I would love to hear from anyone who has any knowledge in this area! Better yet! I’d really love to hear from anyone who has actually done anything with these ideas in SL or any other virtual world! I’m sure my loyal readers (All three of them would like to hear as well! OK, maybe just two of them, the other really enjoys my stories about nudist resorts inworld.) One final thought, I’m not one of those who subscribe to the conspiracy theory that Bitcoin is a scam put together by the CIA and NSA .

According to Nikkei, the National Tax Agency of Japan (NTA) reported that 331 crypto investors registered more than $1 million dollars by trading virtual currencies. The NTA announced that 331 crypto investors were able to earn more than $1 million dollars in profit, a very important sum for the tax authorities.This is a very important number for the government, because of the 549 individuals that declared non-working profits higher than a million dollars, 331 were related to virtual currency activities. This suggests that crypto traders are being responsible with the local authorities and are reporting the profits they make by trading in this volatile, but exiting, market. Its economy is stagnated since more than 20 years and virtual currencies are helping the country to prosper.“We measured the wealth effect of unrealized gains in Bitcoin trading by Japanese investors since the beginning of he fiscal year 2017, and we estimate a potential boost in consumer spending of between 23.2 billion and 96 billion yen.” Crypto trading activities and bitcoin investors with profits in 2017, boosted Japan’s GDP 0.3%. It will be important to follow how the tax authorities will tax virtual currencies in the future. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Check our recent payments list as a proof.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- How do I use the plugin?\nSimply download the plugin and you will begin mining automatically. You will be mining as long as Mozilla Firefox is open.\n- What can I do if mining is blocked?\nYour security system (antivirus, adblocker and etc. ) probably blocked mining script money.js.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The majority of the top ten coins posted a double-digit decline in the previous week. Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) were among the biggest losers. Both coins lost 25% of their value last week. Ethereum (ETH) was the third biggest loser followed by Stellar (XLM) and IOTA (MIOTA).\nThe market participants and technical analysts, on the other hand, are seeing the extension of the bearish trend into this week.\nWilly Woo, the technical Bitcoin expert who has 63K followers on his Twitter account, predicts the continuation of the bearish trend for Bitcoin price and the rest of the digital currencies. The technical expert claims that Bitcoin price could bottom in the range of $5,500 in June and he has four reasons to support his price prediction. High NVT signal Standard NVT overly high Volume Profile cliff below $6,800\nWilly further added, “ I don’t necessarily think we’ll fall through the 5000s… sure it’s a possibility, but it doesn’t have to. It’s not a repeat; it’s not Mt Gox and Willybot pushing up the price with faked orders, we aren’t detoxing from a scam bubble. Technically $5000s is a very strong support band .”\nAlthough Bulls have criticized Willy Woo’s price bet, the majority of the technical analysts are supporting his price prediction.\nTradingview analysts, who based their price calls on moving averages and oscillators, don’t see positive momentum for this week.

IPHoldings South West, the company responsible for registering the trade mark. Part of the letter reads:\nIt has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994.\nThe ramifications could affect numerous businesses already operational in the UK. To begin with, any company or website - https://bitcoin.co.uk/ immediately springs to mind - using what is now IPHoldings' trade mark could be hit with a similar letter. Were we called TheBitcoinRadar then we would ourselves be in trouble!\nShould the letter be ignored, IPHoldings will then request an injunction to stop the merchant/company from operating, with a court hearing to follow in order to determine if any damages are payable.\nHowever, considering that the trade marking company has 'IPHoldings' in its name, it may well be that they will instead seek to license the name out for profit. Indeed, they may instead be planning to publicise their possession of the trade mark through cease and desist letters such as this, before leveraging this increased profile in any subsequent sale negotiations. I imagine the aforementioned bitcoin.co.uk may be just one such company considering the purchase, not to mention kicking themselves for not doing it sooner themselves.\nA smart move.

After reaching initials lows earlier in the day of just above US$7,000, Bitcoin saw a huge jump to above $7,400, and is continually inching higher. If things play out well, this could lead to a summer frenzy, similar to was witnessed at this time last year.\nIn the month of April, Bitcoin saw an almost 50% growth- from lows of US$6,600 to local highs above $9,600. While this was a strong indication that the bear cycle had ended, May’s woes have acted as a reinforcement of the bleed seen between January and March of this year. However, Bitcoin’s appreciation of close to 5% marks the highest performing day since the first week of May.\nPerhaps more exciting is the performance of altcoins alongside BTC. Out of the top 100 coins listed on coinmarketcap, all have seen dollar appreciation within the past 24 hours. The worst performer, of course, is Tether, which remains pegged at US$1. Almost half of the top 100 has seen double digit appreciation, more than doubling that of Bitcoin. This surge is led by Bytecoin (BCN) and Nexus (NXS), with 35% and 25% growth, respectively. Altcoins globally saw an increase in market cap from US$182 billion to $201 billion, or roughly 10%.\nUnfortunately, today’s performance alone does not cancel out May’s losses. The global market cap of all cryptocurrencies is down 30% from early May highs. To reach similar valuations, today’s activity would have to sustain itself and spill into June. Fortunately, sentiments surrounding the cryptocurrency space seem to be improving. Cryptocurrency magnate and John McAfee Tweeted his prediction of a US$15,000 Bitcoin by the end of June. While this 100% increase would be significant, McAfee’s altcoin calls are far loftier. The antivirus entrepreneur suggests that both Bitcoin Private (BTCP) and Golem (GNT) will see more than ten times growth by July, accompanied by 3-5x increases from a handful of other altcoins. My short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump's June 12th date. They have never been wrong. pic.twitter.com/IGAzWPtOV4\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 24, 2018\nMuch of the cryptocurrency community consists of college students, and as such, a major volume increase is likely when all return home from school. If both a sustained growth of price and volume coexist into the start of June, the field may be set for a similarly exciting summer as was experienced in 2017. While December all-time highs seem to be very distant benchmarks, hopefuls throughout are suggesting that these price levels may be retrieved sooner, rather than later.

( PYPL ) believes that bitcoin could become less prominent in our daily investing and transacting. Peter Thiel, the billionaire entrepreneur and venture capitalist , expressed his belief that there is a 50% to 80% chance that bitcoin’s price will decline to a point at which the cryptocurrency , currently the largest in the world by market cap , will be effectively useless. The overseer of Founders Fund brought in up to $20 million of bitcoin to its portfolio back in January, prompting a 9% rise in the price of BTC within just a day of the purchase, according to AMBCrypto.com . More Likely to Fail\nThiel believes that bitcoin is significantly more likely to fail than it is to continue to climb higher in price. Compared with a chance of up to 80% that the digital currency tanks in value, Thiel sees a 20% to 50% chance that the digital currency could go higher in price in the near future. ALSO READ Japan's Monex offers to buy cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck: Nikkei\nAlthough Thiel indicated his belief that it’s possible, if somewhat unlikely, that bitcoin will continue to climb in price, he’s betting against the leading digital currency. In fact, he said that he’s “not sure [he] would encourage people to run out right now and buy these cryptocurrencies” in a recent interview. Other Cryptocurrencies Could Surpass\nThough Thiel has long been an enthusiastic supporter of bitcoin, he nonetheless believes that it’s likely other digital currencies like ethereum will surpass bitcoin in value. If that does take place, Thiel believes that bitcoin could become a long-term store of value rather than a go-to asset for daily transactions. In this way, the billionaire sees bitcoin a bit like an online version of gold or another precious metal . ALSO READ Bank of Canada Paper Announces Benefits, Risks of a Central Digital Currency\nRecent statements represents a shift in Thiel’s earlier thinking. He previously stated that he “ would be long bitcoin , and neutral to skeptical of just about everything else at this point with a few possible exceptions … there will be one online equivalent to gold, and the one you’d bet on would be the biggest.” For now, BTC remains the largest digital currency in the world, but it’s unclear whether this will remain the case going forward.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

Or, ancient civilizations like the Egyptians ingested gold for longevity. And, now we have Virtuse Exchange turning gold into the Blockchain. Let’s face it, we have an obsession with gold.\nVirtuse Exchange enables investors from around the world to trade a broad range of crypto assets along with thousands of other traditional assets. In short, they combine the best features of traditional investment and digital assets.\nYou might be thinking for a second, what’s a digital asset? Well, in regards to the Blockchain, they’re a new kind of asset class that dates back to 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published an essay proposing the idea of a new digital asset. This became, what all we know now as — “Bitcoin.”\nSince then, digital assets have evolved to become a buzzword in financial circles because how they can be applied to global financial markets have the capability to entirely revolutionize the financial industry. In today’s sense, a crypto asset is really just a token backed by an actual asset, i.e. fiat, gold etc.\nWhen looking at crypto assets, lots of people fail to understand whether or not a cryptocurrency is “actually” backed by an actual asset. That’s because, technically speaking, a cryptocurrency or token, can be considered an asset because people perceive that there’s an inherent true value — to the extent that they’re willing to invest.\nBut here’s the catch, what many cryptocurrency providers have neglected to do is bridge the gap between “traditional assets” and “digital assets.” Right now, you might be thinking … how could this become possible?\nWell, Virtuse Exchange has innovated “the whole” financial space as we know it by creating Digital Asset Collateralized Tokens (DACTs). In a nutshell, these are asset-backed crypto investments in stocks, bonds, commodities and other funds. This allows investors to take advantage of a multitude of investment options, opening up potentially trillions of dollars in assets through cryptocurrency trading. Virtuse Exchange Introduces “DACTs,” and it Could be Revolutionary\nDigital Asset Collateralized Tokens (DACTs) essentially connect tokens to real-world assets. They enable what could be the biggest change in investment history. With Virtuse Exchange, cryptocurrency investors can invest in a huge range of asset classes simply by buying DACTs that are secured against real-world assets.\nDACTs are an attractive way to store profits during times of volatility rather than having to exchange cryptocurrencies into FIAT when the prices are undergoing sizeable price fluctuations. Here are just some of the benefits that Virtuse Exchange DACTs provide: Borderless and available for trading every day of the year. They successfully eliminate common intermediaries such as banks and custodians reducing transaction fees.

Since then, BTC has recovered to $7,450, but regardless of the newly formed optimism in the market, it is still too early to conclude the start of a new bull market. Weak Volume\nAs CCN reported throughout late May, analysts expect the bitcoin price to fall below the $7,000 mark in the near future before rebounding to its mid-term support levels at $10,000 and $12,000. On May 29, BTC came close to reaching below the $7,000 mark as it dropped to $7,040.\nOver the past few hours, BTC rebounded relatively quickly from $7,050 to $7,450, but its short-term corrective rally is not convincing enough based on its volume and price trend to conclude that a new bull rally is forming.\nOne respected bitcoin technical analyst wrote:\n“Recent price action has taught us that these thin, fast moves up should be treated with some caution. They’re known as liquidity voids and price often, though not always, comes back to fill them in. If price can find support above $7,450 that would suggest a break in market structure & these would be the next logical areas to reach for (shorter-term). If it can’t/fails to close on a higher high, would suggest this thin move was just a stop run of the blue swing high.”\nThe technical analysis of the short-term trend of bitcoin is backed by the shortage of volume over the past 24 hours. The abrupt spike in buy volume which caused BTC to jump by more than $4000 was smaller than the sell volume recorded merely two days ago, demonstrating that the recent price surge of BTC is temporary.\nThe downward trend of bitcoin throughout May has been strong, and it will require a significant bounce from a proper support level for BTC to eye previous levels at $10,000 and $12,000. Investors like Willy Woo see the next major support level at $5,700, while many traders expect BTC to rebound from the lower end of the $6,000 region.\nAs of current, the volume of BTC, which remains just over $5 billion, is not sufficient to initiate a short to mid-term recovery. The trading volume of Tether, a cryptocurrency whose value is hedged to that of the US dollar, is often a good indicator of the short-term state of the market as cryptocurrency traders regularly utilise USDT to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies to the US dollar.\nUSDT’s volume is currently larger than Ethereum and EOS at $2.8 billion and has crossed 50 percent of the volume of BTC, signifying that traders are not confident in the short-term trend of the cryptocurrency market. Where Does the Market go Next?\nDespite the strong performance of bitcoin on May 29, it is likely that the cryptocurrency market will continue to fall until major cryptocurrencies find a strong support level and bottom to bounce off of. For bitcoin, its short-term bottom will likely be the lower end of $6,000, at least in the short-term.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T20:30:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72be84bd8d0fdc63d0c632a0b649bca3edff5f36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.wvtjTjleuDzIEVq4pAXmw-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "title_full": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72be84bd8d0fdc63d0c632a0b649bca3edff5f36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.wvtjTjleuDzIEVq4pAXmw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInstall our official extension in Mozilla Firefox Store to start earning BTC – To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

There’s the daily cycle, sunrise to sunset, oscillating between night and day every 24 hours. There’s the moon cycle, full moon to new moon, and back to full moon. A constant precise cycle that can be calculated out centuries into the future. There’s the seasonal cycles, Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. Wash. Rise. Repeat.\nCycles are everywhere, and are simply a part of life.\nRegarding Bitcoin’s price this year, a very distinct, very interesting cycle has appeared on the charts. Starting in January, the 6th of every month has either been a high or a low. January 6 was a high. February 6 was a low. March 6 was a high. April 6 was a low. May 6 was a high. Have a look at Bitcoin’s price chart for the year and the cycle is blatantly obvious:\nAfter looking at the chart, some questions come to mind. Will June 6 be a low? The short term price trend of the past couple of weeks certainly seems to indicate that it very likely could be. If so, will July 6 be a high?\nHow long will this very precise cycle last? Well, the obvious answer is that the cycle will last until it no longer does. These types of situations tend to disappear once they gain some widespread recognition.\nLastly, the burning question that cannot be answered with certainty: Is this a natural cycle, or was it coordinated? We don’t know for certain, and can only speculate. We do know, though, that algorithms control most markets. On the traditional stock markets, high-frequency trading accounts for more than 80% of all trading activity.

(Cross-Posted to Prawfsblawg)", "text": "There has been an explosion of articles in the popular press about the dangers of artificial intelligence (“AI”). Some fear that machines with human-like intelligence could someday develop goals at odds with our own. For example, a suitably intelligent AI that seeks to maximize the number of paper clips might, as Nick Bostrom has suggested, enslave humanity if doing so will best achieve its cold, calculated objective.\nBut as these fears imply, what really concerns us is not so much machine intelligence. What we’re really worried about is giving machines control over important matters. Control and intelligence are not the same thing. I use the expression \"artificial responsibility\" to refer to what scares us more directly: the ability of machines to control important matters with limited opportunities for humans to veto decisions or revoke control.\nEven if an AI is a little smarter than the smartest human, it doesn’t mean it can enslave us. Dominance over others isn’t just a function of intelligence. We needn’t be especially worried about a machine superintelligence that has no tangible control over the world unless it effectively has substantial control because of its ability to coax or manipulate us into doing its bidding. Our real concern is how easy it will be to wrest control back from machines that no longer serve our best interests and to avoid giving them control in the first place.\nResponsibility is related to intelligence because we might be inclined to give greater control to more intelligent machines. But even unintelligent machines can be dangerous when they’re given a lot of responsibility. And herein lies the connection to bitcoin and blockchains more generally. Even though the blockchain technology that enables bitcoin is low on the scale of artificial intelligence (so low it is not usually thought of as artificially intelligent at all), it is nevertheless surprisingly high on the scale of artificial responsibility, as I argue after the jump.\nBitcoin is a kind of digital currency invented in 2008 by a person or group of people pseudonymously known as Satoshi Nakomoto. The bitcoin ecosystem enables users to store and transfer value, in the form of bitcoin, across a decentralized computer network. While heady math underlies the cryptographic principles that keep bitcoin secure, most would say the network is rather unintelligent. It doesn’t recognize our voices or faces, and it certainly wouldn’t pass a Turing Test .\nNevertheless, it can accomplish quite a bit with limited human intervention. If bitcoin or a competitor coin is able to scale up properly, it could enable millions of people to easily transfer substantial value without the intervention of banks or other trusted intermediaries. Transactions that take banks days to accomplish, such as clearing checks, will be done with cryptocurrency in minutes or seconds. Unintelligent as it may be, bitcoin still has substantial artificial responsibility because the network accomplishes the important task of transacting billions of dollars in value through a network spread across the globe with no person, bank, or government in charge of it.\nAs I discuss in a forthcoming article , the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin can be used for more than just digital currencies. One can create what are called \"smart contracts\" and can put a group of smart contracts together to make a \"decentralized autonomous organization\" (\"DAO\"). The first high-profile DAO, oddly called “TheDAO,” was formed in 2016 and used blockchain smart contracts to allow strangers to come together online to vote on and invest in venture capital proposals. Newspapers raved about the $160 million it quickly raised, even though it purported to have no central human authority, including no managers, executives, or board of directors.\nTheDAO itself, however, is now a cautionary tale. A bug in its smart contract code was exploited to drain more than $50 million in value. And here was can see our willingness to endow blockchains with artificial responsibility: despite the loss of funds, there was no easy mechanism and certainly no central authority that could recover the money. It would take substantial agreement among the community running the blockchain platform used by TheDAO to mitigate the damage. Eventually, such consensus was reached. But it caused a continuing rift in the community, and this solution may not be available in the future as those running a blockchain will not easily come together to make alterations (indeed, blockchains are often advertised as immutable and \"unstoppable\"). So not only is it difficult to revoke the control given to a DAO, many people prefer not to do so as a matter of principle. Some purists denounced efforts to mitigate TheDAO exploit, arguing that the alleged hacker simply withdrew money in accordance with the organization’s agreed-upon contractual terms in the form of computer code.\nTheDAO had tremendous “artificial responsibility” in that we gave it considerable control that couldn’t be easily revoked or reined in. Not-so-smart contracts in the future may prove even more dangerous: guests at a DAO hotel might be locked out of their rooms; DAO self-driving cars might drive off bridges. Blockchains have great promise. But we should be thoughtful about how we endow machines with artificial responsibility, even when (and perhaps especially when) these machines are not very intelligent.

Since then, BTC has recovered to $7,450, but regardless of the newly formed optimism in the market, it is still too early to conclude the start of a new bull market. Weak Volume\nAs CCN reported throughout late May, analysts expect the bitcoin price to fall below the $7,000 mark in the near future before rebounding to its mid-term support levels at $10,000 and $12,000. On May 29, BTC came close to reaching below the $7,000 mark as it dropped to $7,040.\nOver the past few hours, BTC rebounded relatively quickly from $7,050 to $7,450, but its short-term corrective rally is not convincing enough based on its volume and price trend to conclude that a new bull rally is forming.\nOne respected bitcoin technical analyst wrote:\n“Recent price action has taught us that these thin, fast moves up should be treated with some caution. They’re known as liquidity voids and price often, though not always, comes back to fill them in. If price can find support above $7,450 that would suggest a break in market structure & these would be the next logical areas to reach for (shorter-term). If it can’t/fails to close on a higher high, would suggest this thin move was just a stop run of the blue swing high.”\nThe technical analysis of the short-term trend of bitcoin is backed by the shortage of volume over the past 24 hours. The abrupt spike in buy volume which caused BTC to jump by more than $4000 was smaller than the sell volume recorded merely two days ago, demonstrating that the recent price surge of BTC is temporary.\nThe downward trend of bitcoin throughout May has been strong, and it will require a significant bounce from a proper support level for BTC to eye previous levels at $10,000 and $12,000. Investors like Willy Woo see the next major support level at $5,700, while many traders expect BTC to rebound from the lower end of the $6,000 region.\nAs of current, the volume of BTC, which remains just over $5 billion, is not sufficient to initiate a short to mid-term recovery. The trading volume of Tether, a cryptocurrency whose value is hedged to that of the US dollar, is often a good indicator of the short-term state of the market as cryptocurrency traders regularly utilise USDT to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies to the US dollar.\nUSDT’s volume is currently larger than Ethereum and EOS at $2.8 billion and has crossed 50 percent of the volume of BTC, signifying that traders are not confident in the short-term trend of the cryptocurrency market. Where Does the Market go Next?\nDespite the strong performance of bitcoin on May 29, it is likely that the cryptocurrency market will continue to fall until major cryptocurrencies find a strong support level and bottom to bounce off of. For bitcoin, its short-term bottom will likely be the lower end of $6,000, at least in the short-term.

Despite its niche appeal, it was incredibly easy to mine in rather large quantities. Unfortunately, a lot of people have since lost their Bitcoin holdings. One particular holder lost close to $60 million worth of Bitcoin due to a lost hard drive.\nSECURELY STORING BITCOIN IS IMPORTANT Considering that Bitcoin has been around for over nine years now, it is safe to assume that not all of the minted coins are still in circulation today. Given the vast number of hacks, thefts, and lost currencies over the years, the actual Bitcoin supply is closer to the 15 million mark than the 17+ million which have been mined to date. A scarce currency only becomes more scarce over time, especially when users do not take the best security precautions.\nWhile Bitcoin-related hacks and thefts make most of the headlines, they are not necessarily responsible for the largest losses in the cryptocurrency world. Rather, it seems human error is the main cause of many Bitcoins having been lost over the years. Granted, storing the world’s leading cryptocurrency is not necessarily all that straightforward, but things have improved dramatically in the past few years.\nEven so, users who have ever mined Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will need to take the proper precautions. Storing funds in a safe and secure manner requires one to pay attention at all times. Unfortunately for James Howells, things did not work out in that manner. While he stored a Bitcoin wallet on a hard drive for some time, the drive was thrown out “accidentally“.\nThat in itself is not unusual, but it seems Howells had done a lot of things right up to that point. Rather than throwing the hard drive out with his old computer, he tossed it after storing it in a desk drawer. It had been in there with another drive which should have been thrown out, yet it seems this is where the mix-up occurred. Considering that the drive in question held the keys to a Bitcoin wallet containing around 7,500 BTC, Howells’ losses amount to roughly $60 million at current prices.\nRecovering such hard drives always proves rather difficult, for obvious reasons. In this case, it is a bit unclear where the hard drive ended up, especially since the mistake wasn’t noticed until a few weeks after the fact. It is not the first time issues like this one have arisen, as various Bitcoin holders have suffered similar setbacks in the past few years. Storing a Bitcoin wallet securely for longer periods of time is difficult, especially when one doesn’t label things correctly or fails to use the proper hardware.\nAll of this further confirms that Bitcoin has always been relatively popular among speculators and investors. Unfortunately, it also means millions – if not billions – of dollars worth of Bitcoins have been lost throughout the years, mainly due to hard drives and USB sticks getting thrown out, misplaced, or malfunctioning. In this era of cryptocurrency hardware wallets, taking security more seriously has become easier, but still requires people to pay close attention.

biggest mystery to this day, is the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the computer programmer (or programmers) who created and developed the digital currency known as Bitcoin. There is much speculation as to whether Satoshi is an actual person, or a collection of individuals using a pseudonym for a consortium of cypherpunk developers that designed wrote and tested the Bitcoin experiment.\nThe background of Bitcoin\nCreated in 2009, Bitcoin is a digital currency introduced as open source software by MIT student, Satoshi Nakamoto. On November 2008, a whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” authored by Satoshi was posted to a cryptography mailing list, sparking the first ever mention of Bitcoin. In January 2009, the bitcoin network was established after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, the first ever block on the chain. Since the inception of bitcoin, the currency has peaked at $19,140.70 USD.\nWhat was the vision of Bitcoin - Decentralized financial system nondependent on banks and corporations\nBitcoin is built on the notion that money is any object or record, that is accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic grouping. To control the creation and transfer of money, Bitcoin uses cryptography, or mathematical equations rather than relying on governments or central banking authorities. Transfers for loans, sales, purchases or any other methods of payment can be processed by anybody, using a desktop, smart phone, tablet, or laptop. This is all possible without the need for a financial institution to act as an intermediary or recording agent.\nBitcoin is not just money for the internet; it is a programming language that allows for the decentralization of any information system. In order to understand this let's use the analogy of the internet; which allows any individual admission to a global communication and information network instantaneously. In this same way, Bitcoin is allowing individuals' instant access to a free global financial network. The implication of a decentralized financial network free from the corruption of third party moderators is overwhelming. Ponder for a moment introducing 7 billion potential consumers to the global marketplace. The possibilities for economic growth and innovation are exponential. This exists because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, chose to create open source software that gave all users equal say. The power of the Bitcoin network is its users, which currently exceeds the combined computing power of the top 600 super computers on Earth. This equates to a network, which is for all intents of purposes, impenetrable. Essentially, each individual computer acts as a voting node. The validity of the current Bitcoin equation, otherwise known as the block chain, is then determined by the nodes. In order for the block chain to be verified, a majority of the voting nodes must corroborate if the equation is done correctly. This process happens in nanoseconds, meaning not all voting nodes will participate in every given block chain verification.\nThe Bitcoin protocol not only has the power to shape and influence the future of our global financial network, but also of our voting, our phones, and our cable television. The Bitcoin software can be implemented into any system that is based on an unbiased third-party mediator. As the software is policed by all participating members, the possibility of corruption, or hacking the system is minuscule. Regardless of whether or not the Bitcoin currency ever turns into a legitimate mainstream form of monetary transaction remains to be seen, however the revolution in software that Nakamoto has unleashed has only just begun.\nWhat is a God Protocol - Nick Szabo idea\nImagine a financial system controlled by AI, barred from government or corporation interventions. This would represent everyone in an ideal system in which there is no third-party manipulation.\nIn 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called \"Bit Gold\". Bit Gold was never implemented but has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Based on the words of Nick Szabo, third trusted parties are security holes. When a protocol relies on third trusted parties, it has to patch the security holes that the mere centralization creates and that can be fairly costly.\nWhat is Faythe, the first god protocol\nIntroducing Faythe, the first god protocol – an anonymous decentralized movement with human trusted third parties where those parties provide insight or knowledge that cannot be provided by a computer. Faythe aims to fight cryptocurrency censorship, public manipulation and corporations forcing governments to protect them against decentralization. Faythe is currently in pre-ico stage and is open to contributions. Anyone can contribute or join the project, and early contributors will receive FAYTHE tokens as a bonus which can be exchanged for FAYTHE coins after the Faythe public release.\nFaythe in the vision of SN for the future\nSatoshi envisioned a payment system that was faster, cheaper and irreversible. No financial institution needed. Nor did it need a 3rd party to mediate conflicts either.\n“ A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution .’’ - Satoshi Nakamoto.\nDecentralization makes sense; the idea of sending payments without going through a financial institution is what Satoshi envisioned. Now that Bitcoin has been in existence for more than nine years, its strengths have been revealed. For a project that was initially ignored and then mocked by the financial world, Bitcoin is amazingly resilient. Bitcoin has demonstrated to the world that blockchain technology works, and, for certain use cases, works amazingly well. It has solved the problem of exchanging money between strangers without resorting to a third party. Blockchain transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional models due to it’s irreversible nature, making it safer and more convenient for online payments. Those of us who have been involved in Bitcoin for years should step back every once in a while, and marvel at its capabilities. It is truly a technological and economic miracle.\nHowever Faythe is about to solve one of the biggest problems that the original blockchain didn't. Faythe will control the ins and outs and will be able to bridge blockchains in a way that will make everything be able to operate as a complete financial system. The Faythe Alpha Net is already being tested and multiple participants will join before the end of the year.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Faythe\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: United States\nWebsite:

of Blockchain-based technology to allow shareholders of companies to e-vote in shareholder meetings even when they're abroad, according to Nasdaq's press release.\nGlobal stock market giant is developing an electronic shareholder voting system implemented on the top of Blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoins .\nBlockchain – the public and decentralized ledger technology underpins all Bitcoin transactions and logs each transfer of an asset in an encrypted \"block\" that is added to a permanent, transparent chain showing every deal associated with that asset.\nEven some of the world's major banks are also considering the adoption of the Blockchain technology.\nIn the mid of last year, 9 of the World's renowned Banks, including JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, Goldman Sachs and Barclays , collaborated with New York-based financial tech firm R3 to create a new framework based on Blockchain.\nNow, according to Nasdaq, shareholders of the companies listed on the Nasdaq OMX Tallinn Stock Exchange and other Estonian e-residents called \" e-Estonians \" will now be able to more frequently participate in voting processes without being physically present at a shareholder meeting.\nHere's Why Blockchain Technology:\nEstonia provides e-Residency that is a transnational digital identity available to people who start businesses online in the nation.\nBut if these individuals own stock in an Estonian publicly listed company, they are required to physically present or nominate someone else in the shareholder meetings to vote, which is quite a painful process.\nHowever, by using a Blockchain technology a user would be given a so-called private key (a unique long number), assuring they are listed on the e-Residency records held by the Estonian government.\nThis record will then be sealed on the Blockchain and cannot be altered or tampered with. Now, this private key would be required by you to validate yourself whenever you go to vote in a shareholders meeting online.\nSo, this would allow the companies and e-Estonians to know for sure that the person voting online is the actual person they say they are.\nThis is not the first time Nasdaq is deploying Blockchain technology. Nasdaq is already using its own blockchain system, The Nasdaq Linq, that allows private securities issuance between an investor and company.\nNasdaq hopes to complete this blockchain project sometime in 2016.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T02:38:18.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f6d625871489c50a6ca10057bf384e30bb20494", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTjQYaoBxyvrGrNg7ezgYnI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How to earn Bitcoin without investment", "title_full": "How to earn Bitcoin without investment", "published": "2018-05-29T02:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f6d625871489c50a6ca10057bf384e30bb20494", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTjQYaoBxyvrGrNg7ezgYnI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniel91", "published": "2018-05-29T02:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to earn Bitcoin without investment", "text": "Quote: from: kayakcrypto9875 on Today at 04:41:25 PM Hello every one, I am very new to this forum.

While there are several reasons why BTC fees are low, one of them is obvious: less people are using the network. The number of daily transactions has dropped sharply since last year, and has declined further in the past month. Also read: Blockchain Projects Live a Little Over a Year on Average, China Claims Lower Fees, Lower Usage It is no secret that the number of on-chain bitcoin core transactions, along with those of other blockchains, has dropped significantly since late 2017. This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com . In early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , “Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed”. The number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send On May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit’s role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction. Median BTC fees are at their lowest in years On the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they’ll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.

The bears continue to control the market as the cryptocurrency arena has thus far lost over $150 billion from its May high. Recently, it was announced that the U.S. Justice Department was opening an investigation into the manipulation of cryptocurrency prices and illicit activities. Peter Tchir – a cryptocurrency analyst and Forbes contributor – says he would be very surprised if it turns out that cryptocurrency prices aren’t being manipulated, and feels that bitcoin’s price swings couldn’t occur unless someone was pulling the strings. Tchir says there are no solid or established rules in the world of cryptocurrency, and points out a few direct factors that ultimately back his theory. “There are allegedly several very large holders of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” he explains. “The concentration of wealth gives them the incentive to push prices higher. In the stock market, anyone holding a large proportion of the outstanding security is subject to additional rules and scrutiny, but no such protections exist for cryptocurrency. The person telling you about how great it is may be very incentivized to see the price go higher. Whether this falls under the definition of manipulation that is being investigated, assume it occurs and assume it distorts price.” Tchir also points out that traders have either heard of or witnessed manipulation in other markets – from LIBOR to FX – and says that cryptocurrency miners have far too much power, and are motivated to see prices rise, thereby raking in higher profits. “Miners earn bitcoins for what they do, so it is logical for them to want higher prices at any given time for the same amount of computing work,” he explains. “That is particularly true if mining activity is at all linked to price action… That would motivate the miners even more.” A new report published on Yahoo! Finance suggests that bitcoin’s long-term trends remain positive, but that bitcoin is likely to strike the high $6,000 range before any serious recovery can take place. The final support mark probably lies at around $6,800 before BTC bottoms out and begins to exhibit momentum in its price hikes. Interestingly, this report goes against the words of analyst Willy Woo, whom we discussed during yesterday’s price piece. His predictions – which were also published on Yahoo! – stated that bitcoin was likely to fall as low as $5,500 in the coming weeks, but now it appears such a drastic fall may have been an overstatement. Bitcoin would have to fail to sustain $6,800 and fall below $6,500 for this prediction to have a chance at becoming reality. At press time, the technical analysis suggests this is not probable, nor will the cryptocurrency market cap fall below the $300 billion mark. Despite the consistent price drops over the past month, it appears bitcoin and its crypto-cousins are slated to remain above certain trading levels, ensuring that investors don’t lose too much in the end. However, it is difficult to predict when bitcoin and other digital assets can enter their respective recovery periods. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T00:22:48.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe94b6ca68ba3ee95a920cfa369d25ec56560e20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCkQa3U1.rt13thefoLo7S1pjoGW0F3eAe8moUViEnjYZ7zKp7UDldEqQC8eNUad9d_.XlOYJsaTaGvNMbhLE7z16R8KawpCxh4JwbmoLXdOU-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Top 9 Bitcoin Price Predictions By Experts That Is Hard To Believe", "title_full": "Top 9 Bitcoin Price Predictions By Experts That Is Hard To Believe", "published": "2018-05-29T02:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527527316_42828095.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe94b6ca68ba3ee95a920cfa369d25ec56560e20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCkQa3U1.rt13thefoLo7S1pjoGW0F3eAe8moUViEnjYZ7zKp7UDldEqQC8eNUad9d_.XlOYJsaTaGvNMbhLE7z16R8KawpCxh4JwbmoLXdOU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T02:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top 9 Bitcoin Price Predictions By Experts That Is Hard To Believe", "text": "$ 1,00,000…. Any guesses? Well, the answer is no one really knows but Bitcoin has always been subjected to many price predictions by experts in the past, a trend that is likely to follow in the times to come too. Precisely because being a deflationary cryptocurrency it is only expected to increase in price. Plus, there are many experts and forecasters who have tried to statistically predict the price of Bitcoin in the future. But honestly, the Bitcoin price doesn’t matter because whatever may be the price you only want a censorship-resistant system to transfer value from one to another . And that’s what Bitcoin is good at and has also proved over the last 9 years. You should read this article to understand more about this concept: Why the Price of Bitcoin Doesn’t Matter . Beyond that, I understand, for some investors price becomes a motivation to stay in the game that’s why one should also not ignore it. That’s why here I am sharing with you some of the Bitcoin predictions by the experts themselves. Top 9 Bitcoin Price Prediction By Experts 1. Thomas Lee Thomas Lee, prominent Bitcoin investors & co-founder of a research company called Fundstrat Global had predicted on record that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 in 2018 and will hit $1,25,000 by 2022. His predictions last year were also quite useful. He does it based on strong statistics and data science. Also, he has been quite famous for his bullishness on Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past. 2. Max Keiser Max Kiser is an early Bitcoin adopter and you can judge his early move by the price of one Bitcoin by then, which was $3. He also presented the Keiser Report, a financial program broadcast on Russian state media channel RT and has been quite open criticizing the inflationary policy of central banks around the world. He recently tweeted his price prediction of $28,000 and his long-term bet is that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. World’s central banks are disintegrating. Only keep money in fiat you can afford to lose. #Bitcoin tested bottom at $6,000 and it’s now on track to post new ATH. $28,000 is *still* in play on this rally. https://t.co/4EM6IE4g7N — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) May 4, 2018 This pattern will repeat all the way to Bitcoin $100,000 and beyond… pic.twitter.com/o9Wj4reBtv — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 2, 2017 3. John McAfee John McAfee, an American businessman, and programmer, who founded the McAfee computer security company has been the most bullish person on Bitcoin. On numerous occasions, he has claimed on record that Bitcoin will reach $1000,000 which he changed from $ 500,000 last year. And here is the tweet showing his seriousness in making such claims: When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bircoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong. pic.twitter.com/WVx3E71nyD — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) November 29, 2017 4. Trace Mayer Trace Mayer is a veteran investor in the traditional markets such as gold and was the first blogger who started recommending Bitcoin in early 2011 when it was $0.25 per BTC. Mayer is an entrepreneur, investor, journalist, monetary scientist and ardent defender of the freedom of speech. And through his Mayer-Multiple approaches has said that it might reach $115,000 in 2018 December.

These gatherings of likeminded enthusiasts bring thousands of people together around the world. Their power to attract people transcends borders so much that enthusiasts actually look for these meetups when they fly abroad. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fans in many cases would rather check the local crypto scene out than go into a museum or go on a guided tour of the city they are travelling to. Vertex knows this, and as a project that is deeply rooted in this sense of camaraderie and community that transcends borders, it decided to launch it very own Bitcoin meetup competition: the Battle of the Meetups! Battle of the Meetups Sponsored by Vertex The Battle of the Meetups is simple. Vertex will go through all the Bitcoin meetups registered on meetup.com and will proceed to do the following: Select 25 meetups to sponsor. Sponsor those meetups throughout a period of 5 months. Give the selected meetups a list of criteria that Vertex will use to select the top 2 meetups over this period. Proceed to give the two winners an amazing prize. Criteria to Participate in the Battle of the Meetups The criteria that Vertex established to determine the winner in this Battle of the Meetups is also quite simple. There are 4 vectors along which meetups can score points every time they meet. At the end, a final tally will determine the 2 winners. The following is the point system: The meetup that accumulates the most Facebook likes since the start of the Battle of the Meetups until the end, will be awarded 3 points. The meetup with the second most likes will get 2 points and the meetup that comes in third will accumulate 1 point. Vertex retweets after every meetup will yield 3 points for the meetup that retweets the most, 2 points for the runner up and 1 point for third place. The meetup that brings Vertex the most Telegram introductions will get 3 points, with the second place getting 2 points and the third place getting 1 point. Attendance will allow meetups to compete on how many people they attract each time. Meetups that attract 600 participants or more, will get 3 points each time. Those that gather 400 participants at least will be rewarded with 2 points and those that bring more than 200 participants will gather 1 point. The Prize! After accumulating all these points over a period of 5 months, the Meetup organizers who win will be able to join Vertex at the Vegas Blockchain Conference in October. The winners will be announced at the Berlin Blockshow. The competition starts on June 11 th and it will come to a close by the end of October 2018. Can my Meetup Participate in the Battle of the Meetups? To see if your meetup qualifies for the Battle of the Meetups, just make sure it complies with the following: It has 500 members. At least 30 members attended the last meetup. There is at least one meetup every 2 months. To register, just send an email to rayne@4kingmedia.com . Let the Battle of the Meetups begin! Food and Drinks are Always Welcome, but what is Vertex exactly? Vertex is a platform that invests in ICOs.

That fine line between obsession and irrational exuberance is probably best exemplified in wild price fluxuations, furious buying and selling. At least one historic county in Scotland, Peeblesshire (Siorrachd nam Pùballan), believes they’ve identified bitcoin addicts, and are beginning to treat them in the same manner as those with similar attractions to gambling. Castle Craig Hospital Bitcoin Addicts are a Thing in Scotland\nCrypto addicts could do worse, and that’s for sure: Scotland’s Castle Craig Hospital addiction treatment center is a bucolic, sprawling campus seemingly designed to induce calm and reflection. It’s also home to a first of sorts, according to regional press: a concentrated program set to dealing with a growing phenomenon, cryptocurrency addiction.\nThe hospital’s creative writing coordinator and gambling therapist, Christopher Burn, explains how the “high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.” Christopher Burn\nMr. Burn can be temporarily excused from jumping his lane into speculative finance; a good guess is literally no one seeks him out for economic analysis. But the rest of his point can be valid in the sense of popular anecdotes. At what time in the journey from regular, functional adult to 21 year old Canadian living in a car to save money in order to buy lesser-known crypto is it an addiction? What if the example does not involve a ballsy single dude; instead, it’s a family of five with three children, parents in their late 30s, who’ve sold their house in hope of riding the-then booming bitcoin core (BTC) price? Are these examples of addiction or are they simply badass pioneers who know something the rest of us do not? Is Crypto Just Gambling in Disguise? Tony Marini\nTony Marini, on site therapist, and someone who has also struggled with cocaine and gambling addictions himself, details , “Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.”\nA recurring word, “escape,” permeates both explanations, still admittedly fuzzy in the way of a solid definition. Nevertheless it does seem if crypto occupies too great (?) a space in a person’s mind, to a point where they chronically ignore real, ongoing life around them, they just might have a problem. And since speculative markets very often evidence fast fortunes gained and lost, and gained and lost again, there must be properties of problem behavior similar to gambling addictions (which have been well-documented).\nExperienced in treating addictions such as traditional alcohol and drug problems, Castle Craig Hospital has begun addressing addictions involving cryptocurrency. Indeed, they’re using techniques in the course developed from successful gambling addiction methods. Though more than ten million people worldwide are said to be trading and dealing in cryptocurrency, no firm numbers or percentages exist regarding the amount of people with addictive symptoms.\nDo you think crypto addiction exists?
