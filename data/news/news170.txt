It is expected that the development of such a fund could lift the cryptocurrency's value.\nHe said, \"That's how blockchains gain value. You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash. That's a place I want to buy.\"\nAccording to coinmarketcap, bitcoin cash was priced on Wednesday at $1,065.99, down 11.3 percent over the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $18.3 billion. This is lower than $1,600 as on May 5, but significantly higher than $760 in April.\nBitcoin Cash, a peer-to-peer digital currency, was established in mid-2017.\nIn early May, a planned lawsuit by pro-Bitcoin community against Bitcoin.com, which supports Bitcoin Cash, has been abandoned, citing shortage of funds to proceed with the case. The initiator of the move, MoneyTrigz, alleged that Bitcoin.com was purposely misleading buyers by blurring the distinction between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\nby ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "must-own brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:28:25.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21a3ba230753286f0ad49ba81acb798d9560b864", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPosMHl3iKa2e2HdODS0t475zwkczyl45eB1suVzx6QaVFsvUX6ECiapKANDcEXhYvvzfY_5P_dyafeMAW3tJd3A-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Excellent talk on bitcoin and response to AE critics by Caitlin Long", "title_full": "Excellent talk on bitcoin and response to AE critics by Caitlin Long : btc", "published": "2018-05-23T11:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21a3ba230753286f0ad49ba81acb798d9560b864", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPosMHl3iKa2e2HdODS0t475zwkczyl45eB1suVzx6QaVFsvUX6ECiapKANDcEXhYvvzfY_5P_dyafeMAW3tJd3A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NimbleCentipod", "published": "2018-05-23T11:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Excellent talk on bitcoin and response to AE critics by Caitlin Long", "text": "submitted by /u/NimbleCentipod\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/LbsMKLd8_G0?t=28m38s"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T07:07:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "436dde929437744b4ad9c404e1d3195b957833a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTitbvh8wAtwph.cgYZiDdluVu..rzi08OxlzssO2jByyCxqoI_9sBc0eYw1zu8QGpecfGeyzBuWdkLc8HEw5wygI1vgEMTTv0oMsPy74l4nY2pobV5nZZa", "site_full": "www.pmnewsnigeria.com", "site": "pmnewsnigeria.com", "site_section": "http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PM NEWS Nigeria", "title": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "title_full": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "published": "2018-05-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoins.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14178, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "436dde929437744b4ad9c404e1d3195b957833a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTitbvh8wAtwph.cgYZiDdluVu..rzi08OxlzssO2jByyCxqoI_9sBc0eYw1zu8QGpecfGeyzBuWdkLc8HEw5wygI1vgEMTTv0oMsPy74l4nY2pobV5nZZa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adekunle Dada", "published": "2018-05-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "text": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager 30 mins ago Bitcoins\nA criminal gang in South Africa who kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday are demanding a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency of nearly 120,000, dollars police said.\nPolice spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said, Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon.\n“They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA.\n“(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are.

SARB does not oversee, supervise or regulate cryptos and they are therefore not guaranteed/backed,” he said.\n“However, should a resident natural person wish to purchase cryptos from abroad, SARB’s view is that the only permissible method is by using the individual’s single discretionary allowance (currently R1 million) and/or individual foreign investment allowance (currently R10 million with a Tax Clearance Certificate), per calendar year.”\nThis means that the SARB will not allow a local company to use the foreign direct investment dispensation to invest in offshore cryptos, he said.\nHe added that due to the nature of cryptos, the repatriation of value – for example, on sale and converting to fiat currency into the country – is not a reportable transaction on the SARB’s Reporting system.\n“As such, the repatriation will not be acknowledged as a repatriation of an individual’s single discretionary allowance and/or individual foreign investment allowance,” he said.\n“Similarly, non-residents who have introduced cryptos into the country for sale locally, and who want to transfer the sale proceeds abroad, will be unable to do so in terms of exchange control because there is no proof that foreign currency or rand has been introduced into South Africa.”\nWhat does this mean for you?\nRood said that a South African resident investor wishing to acquire cryptos locally may use one of the few local exchanges, which will then match trades between local buyers and sellers, with no currency actually leaving the country.\n“As a result, there is no exchange control element to these transactions. However, when the local demand outstrips local supply, the local crypto price will rise to persuade holders to part with their cryptos and hence the local rand price often trades at a premium to the global dollar average taken from all major crypto exchanges,” he said.\n“If the same resident then rather wishes to acquire cryptos on an offshore exchange at the lower dollar rate, he or she will then have to use their single discretionary or foreign investment allowance to externalise the rand value to acquire the cryptos in dollar on a foreign exchange. This is not dissimilar to investing in shares on a foreign stock exchange.”\nHowever, Rood noted that problems arise when a resident individual buys R20 million worth (being in excess of the ‘normal’ exchange control investment thresholds) of local Bitcoin via a local exchange, and then proceeds to send that Bitcoin to a wallet held with an offshore exchange.\n“These inter-wallet (or exchange-to-exchange) transfers only involve cryptos, and as these are not regulated by either the SARB or a local bank, no exchange control regulatory intervention takes place,” he said.\nWhile this can be seen as a ‘loophole’, Rood noted that based on its statement , the SARB regards this as a transgression as the resident effectively exports (some form) of capital, without using the approved dispensations and channels.\n“A resident should therefore rather withdraw his investment from his local crypto wallet, and invest the rand amount as per the normal channels,” he said.\n“A further transgression may be encountered where a resident acquires foreign crypto in dollar and then transfers this to a local wallet, specifically to make use of the price arbitrage. It is known that the SARB has undertaken a review of these practices to consider whether further compliance intervention is required,” he said.\nRood added that this ‘loophole’ is likely to be closed by the SARB in the near future, and that the investors should not overlook the exchange control regulations when wading into this already risky crypto environment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leon rood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "werksmans attorneys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T11:36:05.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9c33841f4736ef64cd912686adcfe7b4e242d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQ.lA8pKylV72CHS6cE56cd1r_UpUMQmFhoWne0EzbsdgPHcMRkLbKbg--", "site_full": "www.bitcoin.name", "site": "bitcoin.name", "site_section": "http://www.bitcoin.name/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day Marks Eight", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pizza Day Marks Eight", "published": "2018-05-23T11:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9c33841f4736ef64cd912686adcfe7b4e242d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQ.lA8pKylV72CHS6cE56cd1r_UpUMQmFhoWne0EzbsdgPHcMRkLbKbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adminbtc", "published": "2018-05-23T11:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day Marks Eight", "text": "Leave a reply\nEight years ago today, on 22 May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz of Jacksonville Florida made history by purchasing two large pizzas from Papa Johns with 10,000 Bitcoins . This was considered a major milestone as it was possibly the first time that Bitcoin was used to purchase goods from a major company. Today, ‘Bitcoin pizza day’ is proof that Bitcoin could be used as a currency.\nHanyecz had mined the Bitcoins to purchase the pizza on his personal computer. This is a feat that is now impossible, mining Bitcoins on a personal computer costs more in electricity than the minuscule amount of Bitcoin it produces. Nowadays, expensive specialized mining rigs made with application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are required to have any chance of mining Bitcoin profitably.\nThe pizza was purchased with the help of a forum user on Bitcointalk ; Laslo Hanyecz sent the Bitcoins to the forum user and then the forum user purchased the pizza with their card. Bitcointalk continues to be the most popular Bitcoin and cryptocurrency forum to this day, and was started by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of Bitcoin who disappeared shortly after it launched.\nMany would think that Laszlo Hanyecz would have regrets over using 10,000 Bitcoins to buy a couple of pizzas, since today they are worth an astonishing USD 84 million. Coindesk released a pizza day tracker which updates in real-time how much the 10,000 Bitcoins used to buy the pizza are now worth, expected to result in cringing and astonishment from most.\nHe doesn’t appear to have any, however, he was stoked just to be able to use the Bitcoins to buy pizza since he had gotten them for free by mining on his computer and they were barely worth anything at the time.\nAt the time the infamous pizzas were purchased, each Bitcoin was worth roughly 3/10 of a US penny. This fact help illustrates how enormous the rise in Bitcoin’s price has been. As of this writing, each bitcoin is worth USD 8,200, an incredible rise of 273,300,000% since pizza day. There is probably no other asset in the world that has risen at such a pace as Bitcoin has in the long term.\nNow Bitcoin can be used to buy anything in the world and is accepted on at least a thousand different retail websites , but it all began with one man in Florida using Bitcoin to buy pizza.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Bitcoin Pizza Day Marks Eight appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

By OWEN GOUGH Bitcoin celebrates its heritage today, as the cryptocurrency world remembers the very first transaction made with bitcoin back in 2010.\nThe important milestone was the first baby-steps in the digital token’s journey, as it struggled to become a legitimate decentralised currency.\nEight years ago, 10,000 bitcoin could buy two pizzas delivered to your door, today 10,000 bitcoin would net you £82.3 million (£61.3 million).\nBitcoin is trading today at $8,259 as the market creeps up to the heights seen in 2017.\nWhat is Bitcoin Pizza Day?\nEight years ago today, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer, become enthused with the new concept of cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin.\nTaking the plunge, Hanyecz posted a forum thread claiming he would pay someone 10,000 bitcoins to order and deliver two pizzas from a local Papa John’s Restaurant.\nHanyecz said in the thread: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas…I like having leftover pizza to nibble on later.”\nIt is thought that this transaction was the very first time bitcoin was used in an exchange for goods and services, enshrining it as a legitimate and working currency.\nBitcoin pizza day: What is bitcoin pizza day and why is it celebrated?GETTY\nBitcoin pizza day: What is bitcoin pizza day and why is it celebrated?\nHanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times: “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nIn 2018, the pizza transaction is now celebrated, as the cryptocurrency market takes the world by storm.\nThe cryptocurrency is worth more than $8,000 today, with more than 17 million BTC currently in supply.\nIt used to be that bitcoin was traded between Dark Web trawlers and computer enthusiasts, exchanging hands for drugs and small-time cash deals on the internet.\nBitcoin has since exploded, with Wall Street heavyweights, celebrities and investors across the world buying up the coins.\nOn Bitcoin Pizza Day, some pizza restaurants have even let customers purchase their pizza using bitcoin, though for a much cheaper price than 10,000.\nThe cryptocurrency market has gone from strength to strength, increasing in price steadily in the last two years to reach $8,000 today.\nFundstrat CEO Tom Lee even claimed that bitcoin prices could exceed $20,000 in 2018, if the market continues on its current trajectory.

African Reserve Bank has issued guidance regarding its position on the purchasing and transfer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhile the SARB does not regulate the trade of cryptocurrencies in South Africa, it has stated the consequences of purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies using international exchanges.\nThe only permissible way for South Africans to purchase cryptocurrencies from abroad is to use their single discretionary allowance of R1 million or individual foreign investment allowance of R10 million per year.\nAdditionally, the SARB will not allow a South African company to use the foreign direct investment dispensation to invest in cryptocurrencies from international exchanges.\nAs cryptocurrency transactions are not reportable on SARB’s system, this causes issues regarding the repatriation of value when converting it to fiat currency – or moving sales proceeds abroad.\nPotential problems Werksmans Attorneys director Leon Rood has now stated this could affect South Africans who purchase cryptocurrencies from international exchanges or who store their cryptocurrencies abroad.\nRood said South Africans would be able to purchase cryptocurrencies from local exchanges without encountering exchange control, however.\nIf local buyers opt to purchase from offshore exchanges at a lower dollar rate, they will have to use their single discretionary or foreign investment allowance to acquire the cryptocurrency.\nThis functions similarly to investing in shares on a foreign stock exchange.\nIf a South African purchases R20 million worth of cryptocurrency (above the threshold for international investment) via a local exchange and then moves that cryptocurrency to a wallet held in an offshore exchange, this could also be viewed as a transgression.\nThe SARB views this as a transgression of exchange control as the buyer is essentially exporting capital above the approved dispensation thresholds.\nAcquiring cryptocurrency from offshore exchanges and transferring it to a local wallet to make use of price arbitrage could also incur the wrath of regulators.\nRood said further clarity and specific regulation is required for South Africans to be compliant with the exchange control regulations.\n“In the interim, an investor should not overlook the exchange control regulations when wading into this already risky crypto environment,” he said.\nNow read: Reserve

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price dropped by around 4 percent from $8,300 to $7,850.\n[…]\nBitcoin Price Trend\nAs CCN previously reported , the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to three major factors: Mt. Gox sell-off in early May, Bitfinex taxation policy, and scandal involving South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb.\nThese three factors led investors to lose confidence and trust in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. By targeting a small portion of their user base to forfeit tax IDs and personal identification, Bitfinex led large-scale investors to become fearful of a potential government intervention and withdrew big sums of funds from the exchange.\nIn South Korea, due to the controversy surrounding UPbit and Bithumb, local investors have become bewildered, not knowing whether the local cryptocurrency market can be trusted or not.\nDespite the drastic improvement in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency industry and the entrance of major financial institutions, the overly strong downtrend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies have disallowed the market to rebound and initiate a corrective rally.\nIt is likely that in the short-term, the BTC price drops to the lower end of $7,000, as cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo suggested on May 22:\n“Pretty sure $8,000 support on BTC/USD is gonna fail. Next support, low $7,000s (though that could fail too). Then I’m expecting another dead kitten taking us into July – September period when BTC unwinds completely from mania phase and is ready for an accumulation phase,” said Woo.\n[…]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-ethereum-prices-drop-3-in-sluggish-crypto-market-factors-and-trends/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bithumb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:31:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90ad58e3ff3d300105c8a58be7784aea17f36c6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS3OCVytiSF2Z.zn2GAdWikHzxOyhRozNBTij.f77W6Urum3obJVjfW9RT.aSIDgnmnXZ5FYNhM0EHe1by6TJiiZNNyd6c4hIyLbVwYtc5PeZPmVox71ZoJAWC3cigqgvc-", "site_full": "www.sapeople.com", "site": "sapeople.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/SAPeopleNews", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "africa"], "section_title": "SAPeople – Your Worldwide South African Community", "title": "South Africa Kidnappers Demand Ransom in Bitcoin to Free Teenager", "title_full": "South Africa Kidnappers Demand Ransom in Bitcoin to Free Teenager", "published": "2018-05-23T11:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sapeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-05-23T074822Z_1_LYNXNPEE4M0IV-OZATP_RTROPTP_3_OZATP-US-SAFRICA-CRIME-BITCOIN.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73920, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90ad58e3ff3d300105c8a58be7784aea17f36c6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS3OCVytiSF2Z.zn2GAdWikHzxOyhRozNBTij.f77W6Urum3obJVjfW9RT.aSIDgnmnXZ5FYNhM0EHe1by6TJiiZNNyd6c4hIyLbVwYtc5PeZPmVox71ZoJAWC3cigqgvc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SAPeople", "published": "2018-05-23T11:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa Kidnappers Demand Ransom in Bitcoin to Free Teenager", "text": "South African Kidnappers Demand Ransom in Bitcoin to Free Teenage Boy By Reuters May 23, 2018 Share JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – A criminal gang in South Africa who kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday are demanding a ransom in bitcoin crytocurrency of nearly $120,000, police said. A token of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, December 8, 2017. Picture taken December 8. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nKatlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said.\n“They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA. “(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are. They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.” SAPS issued this photo of the missing teenage boy, Katlego Marite. Police said Katlego was dragged into a gold Toyota corolla. There were allegedly three occupants.\nAlthough police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than $1 million in bitcoins for releasing their victim – an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange.\n(Reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)\nMORE\nLast month current affairs programme Carte Blanche investigated a kidnapping spree in South Africa – you can stream the show by subscribing to Showmax here (even if you’re overseas).\nIf you have any info, please contact Captain Africa Nyathi at 071 352 6007 or call Crime Stop on 08600 10111.

Global Bitcoin Wallet Market Size Status and Forecast 2025 A Bitcoin wallet is a software program where Bitcoins are stored.

The Bitcoin wallet comes in many forms; desktop, mobile, web and hardware are the four main types of wallets.\nA Bitcoin wallet is also referred to as a digital Wallet. Establishing such a wallet is an important step in the process of obtaining Bitcoins. Just as Bitcoins are the digital equivalent of cash, a Bitcoin wallet is analogous to a physical wallet. But instead of storing Bitcoins literally, what is stored is a lot of relevant information like the secure private key used to access Bitcoin addresses and carry out transactions. The four main types of wallet are desktop, mobile, web and hardware.\nTable of Content:\nGlobal Bitcoin Wallet Market Size, Status and Forecast 2025\n1 Industry Overview of Bitcoin Wallet\n2 Global Bitcoin Wallet Competition Analysis by Players\n3 Company (Top Players) Profiles\n3.1 Xapo\n3.1.3 Products, Services and Solutions\n3.1.4 Bitcoin Wallet Revenue (Million USD) (2013-2018)\n3.1.5 Recent Developments\n3.2.3 Products, Services and Solutions\n3.2.4 Bitcoin Wallet Revenue (Million USD) (2013-2018)\n3.2.5 Recent Developments\n3.3.3 Products, Services and Solutions\n3.3.4 Bitcoin Wallet Revenue (Million USD) (2013-2018)\n3.3.5 Recent Developments\n4 Global Bitcoin Wallet Market Size by Type and Application (2013-2018)\n5 United States Bitcoin Wallet Development Status and Outlook\n6 EU Bitcoin Wallet Development Status and Outlook\n7 Japan Bitcoin Wallet Development Status and Outlook\n8 China Bitcoin Wallet Development Status and Outlook\n9 India Bitcoin Wallet Development Status and Outlook\n10 Southeast Asia Bitcoin Wallet Development Status and Outlook\n11 Market Forecast by Regions, Type and Application (2018-2025)\n12 Bitcoin Wallet Market Dynamics\n13 Market Effect Factors Analysis\nAbout ReportsWeb ReportsWeb is a one stop shop of market research reports and solutions to various companies across the globe.

Several experts believe that there are countries that can bypass international sanctions through decentralized cryptocurrencies. Russia and Iran are two countries that are currently under severe sanctions that may soon use cryptocurrencies to circumvent them.\nPoliticians in Russia and Iran are discussing the possibility of using digital currencies to circumvent such sanctions. Decentralization is one of the biggest advantages of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be stopped by a central office or body. In the latest press release of PressTV, Iranian MEP Mohammad-Reza Pourebrahimi discussed during the meeting in Moscow the possibility of using cryptocurrencies for international payments. The meeting was also attended by Dmitry Mezentsev, chairman of the Federation Council's Economic Policy Committee. According to reports, Pourebrahimi stated that Iran and Russia can use digital currencies to avoid US dollar transactions and potentially even replace the SWIFT interbank payment system. In addition, the Iranian Parliament has instructed the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to start creating potential cases of the use of digital currencies. Pourebrahimi stated: \"Russia shares our opinion. We said that if we can move forward with this work, we will be the first countries that use cryptocurrencies to exchange goods. Russia and Iran are considering using the crypto to circumvent sanctions\". Mezentsev noted Pourebrahimi's statement regarding the use of cryptocurrencies and replied: \"Inter-bank relations between our countries are very important. Many sanctioned countries may perceive cryptocurrencies as potential replacements for traditional international banking systems such as SWIFT. International bank transfers are not the only problem facing sanctioned countries. Centralized payment services, such as Paypal or Venmo, are also not allowed in some countries. These payment services can also be replaced by decentralized cryptocurrencies\".\nIran is again facing serious sanctions after President Trump pulled the United States out of its agreement on the nuclear weapons program. Russia noted increased US sanctions for allegedly meddling in the presidential election in 2016.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. As anticipated yesterday the breakout above the old golden trend line was a fake one and currently the price has made a local low at the level of $7,890 on its way to the 61% Fibo at the level of $7,712. If the impulsive scenario is correct, it would be the last wave down labeled on the chart as the wave c, which can terminate in the area between the levels of $,7712 - $7,442.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dmitry mezentsev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad-reza pourebrahimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pourebr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federation council's economic policy committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:20:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d62c8995c51e4ecbacc41a06694f01a8b4828f33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR98uB0fySmkef48VQHdROngbjN0X3elD6pGsjvWMLxMRPPuDBcefzyvBJr8OG.99tuIMrI_lQqOg--", "site_full": "af.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/AFRICATopNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Reuters: Top News", "title": "South Africa kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "title_full": "South Africa kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "published": "2018-05-23T10:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180523&t=2&i=1265073223&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE4M0IV-OZATP", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d62c8995c51e4ecbacc41a06694f01a8b4828f33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR98uB0fySmkef48VQHdROngbjN0X3elD6pGsjvWMLxMRPPuDBcefzyvBJr8OG.99tuIMrI_lQqOg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T10:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "text": "May 23, 2018 / 7:51 AM / Updated 2 hours ago South Africa kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A criminal gang in South Africa who kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday are demanding a ransom in bitcoin crytocurrency of nearly $120,000, police said.

Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said. \"They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,\" he told news channel eNCA. \"(The parents) don't even know what these bitcoins are. They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.\" Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first. In December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than $1 million in bitcoins for releasing their victim - an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange.

below $8,000 amid a market-wide sell-off by Dimitar Bogdanov Wednesday, 23 May 2018, 08:25 BST\nThe Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) has fallen to its lowest level in more than a month amid a fresh sell-off affecting the wider cryptocurrency market.\nThe original cryptocurrency has had difficult start to this week, having posted losses in the previous two sessions. The digital currency performed poorly yesterday, especially in the final hours of the session, which marked the beginning of a steep decline, which resulted in the coin hitting an intraday low of $8,004.58. Bitcoin saw a small uptick just before the end of the session, which allowed it to finish the day at $8,041.78. Still, this was significantly lower than the opening price of $8,419.87.\nThe cryptocurrency continued to fall in the early hours of today’s trading, dropping below the $8,000 mark for the first time in five days. Bitcoin came close to slipping below $7,900 as well, as it hit a fresh low of $7,904.32. This is the coin’s lowest price level since April 18, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nThe cryptocurrency made an attempt to return above the $8,000 level later in the session, but it did not have enough momentum to break through the barrier. Its advance stopped at $7,995.73 and the coin pulled back to lower levels. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $7,965.\nBitcoin’s performance in the past 24 hours has been in line with the wider cryptocurrency market. Most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 have suffered heavy losses over the period and the market as a whole has lost nearly $25 billion.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,963.71, as of 08:20 BST. The digital currency has lost 4.6% of its value in the past 24 hours. Its total market capitalisation currently stands at $135.7 billion.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "",

Previous lawsuits filed in relation to the ICO also contained allegations of securities law violations, as well as investor fraud.\nIn its motion, Bitcoin Suisse further distanced itself from Tezos, stating that the plaintiff failed to connect the two organizations in the lawsuit. As such, it claims that the court does not have jurisdiction over Bitcoin Suisse AG and therefore it should not be involved in the action.\nBitcoin Suisse also claims that MacDonald did not even specify a particular grievance against it, writing, “To assert a claim under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a plaintiff must allege that defendant offered or sold a security in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 77e to the plaintiff.”\nHowever, it continues, “Here, Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege: that Bitcoin Suisse offered or sold a security in connection with the Tezos ICO; and that Plaintiff purchased a security from Bitcoin Suisse in connection with the Tezos ICO.”\nIn supporting this argument, Bitcoin Suisse states that it did not offer or sell securities. A hearing about the filing will likely not be held until July 19, according to the document.\nTezos completed its initial coin offering in July of last year, bringing in a record-breaking $232 million-worth (at the time) of bitcoin and ether.\nLaw image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However the first of the monthly lists surprised onlookers and was even described by analyst Joseph Young as “highly incompetent”.\nOver the last year China has confused the crypto community with its mixed message on all things crypto and bitcoin. In short, China sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralised applications to become significant parts of the future economy. However, confusingly, in the second half of last year the government began a mass crackdown on illegal initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nBroadly speaking, blockchain technology is a fancy electronic database for transactions, where new information is added to the chain and then stamped and protected with a mathematical equation. It has been heralded by as the solution to problems in everything from trust in major banks to medical records and voting registers.\nAs China grows into the role of a global economic superpower, according to one expert the nation sees cryptocurrency and blockchain as an “economic game-changer”.\nKevin Murcko, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinMetro says that China’s message on Bitcoin looks mixed as although it “sees cryptocurrency as a threat to its financial stability”, he said: “China wants to be the front runner in the digital economy era, and as the nation readies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it sees cryptocurrency and blockchain – a technology with enormous potential to remove pain points and inefficiencies – as an economic game-changer.”\nHoping to clear up the uncertainty, the Chinese think tank told Express.co.uk that with a global surge in blockchain hype – or in their words – in the “active innovation on the global public chain”. A spokesman added “this work will help us keep track of that innovation and other industry trends”.\nWhen questioned on the controversial methodology behind the ranking that saw Bitcoin’ s blockchain come 13th and Ethereum top, the spokesman said that a “infrastructure study of public chain” was used alongside “opinions from experts during the evaluation”.\nHowever, the think tank spokeswoman confirmed the final index score came from a “project team” in house and that “the result is objective and fair under this model”.\nJacob Papageorgiou, head of education at LBX told Express.co.uk China banned bitcoin exchanges and ICOs because of the significance they have placed on the future use of blockchain technology. He said: “If they didn’t understand its significance, they simply never would have banned it.”\nOn why the ban came first and the controversial list followed after Mr Papageorgiou said: ”It’s very difficult to influence things when adoption has come; it’s much easier to impose early restrictions and shape the direction of the disruption, and the ban is an example of this.\n“China has always invested heavily on new technology trends, and in 2016 blockchain technology saw its first official mention in China’s 13th Five Year Plan, where it was depicted as one of the major tasks and projects for the nation.”\nThe expert says that there is still a very clear separation between digital currencies and blockchain in China at the moment, with much more of a focus on the fundamental technology and product design behind blockchain projects.\nIn the years to come, he adds: “China will likely become the world’s leading country in blockchain technology. It’s capability for rapid economic development combined with its tech-first approach, institutional backing and revolutionary designs means that when, not if, China does eventually open up ICOs and blockchain development, it will be at a phenomenal growth rate.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin", "http://www.express.co.uk/latest/ethereum"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T10:53:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42afc1271a010d6e1a72810a18eca205102e3c8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTJ_xPp7HnALN6RzcFHcXosX5X16GRrhKzEu7KYhMtFh7x_3DJTLFc44LyVfcngQ4j_KRUCzaTcTo6UDUMu4zS8Ix4MQVUL5evDeB4I3.QD6EonAC8rfoca9TqPFbCq7n2RYn.0D5Q8b9PGjdHXt2fV9kXYBO_VdieYCg16nmtd1lSawNI_vGOmKl4201XutGNA22AXwXZ5cVBt3eE5vN9NVCxCqq9SpM-", "site_full": "www.canberratimes.com.au", "site": "canberratimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.canberratimes.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Canberra Times - Latest News", "title": "Are bitcoin owners a security risk?

The objective of the exchange is to provide a solution to most of the users of the region which are unbanked. The company hired Deloitte to serve as an impartial third party to review and report on operations, procedures, as well as on balances and funds of users and the exchnage.\nThe two companies developed a service that will allow the bank’s customers to make cross-border international payments using bitcoin. The new service will enable clients to transfer money from account to account in less time than traditional bank transfers. It will also reduce settlement times and send or receive transfers by up to 24 hours.\nJose Dakak, a principal shareholder of Masventas, said the move is part of tha bank’s plans to reduce banking service costs, as well as enhance its digital, smartphone-based services.\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad,” Dakak said.\nManuel Beaudroit, Bitex chief marking officer, claims that this marks the first time that a domestic bank has adopted bitcoin for cross-border payments. He said that the bank will soon use bitcoin for real-world transactions.\n“The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider,” said Beaudroit. “For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin.”\nArgentina has been open to blockchain and crypto companies, unlike neighboring countries such as Ecuador. In August 2017, Lucas Llach, vice president of the central bank of Argentina, said that the central bank is “not afraid of bitcoin and likes some of its uses.” Search for:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitex.la/", "https://www.bancomasventas.com.ar/banca-personal/nuestros-servicios/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "argentinian bank using bitcoin for cross-border transactions  argentinian bank using bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:11:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50bebd9b362a7db79a86504742160bc09902c447", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fC7qlF07caGzPYJxgwo8MemIFuEfO88t3Llhc8Bdik1I2PW.9myOQ1HJs2ZddbGd4j_JMnq1dgu9q8IO6WgH63ej55vHKwdjOWKJg2LNKdQ1I-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "PayPal: We’ll ‘Definitely Support’ Bitcoin If It Becomes ‘Better Currency’", "title_full": "PayPal: We’ll ‘Definitely Support’ Bitcoin If It Becomes ‘Better Currency’", "published": "2018-05-23T09:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527044896_71084875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50bebd9b362a7db79a86504742160bc09902c447", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fC7qlF07caGzPYJxgwo8MemIFuEfO88t3Llhc8Bdik1I2PW.9myOQ1HJs2ZddbGd4j_JMnq1dgu9q8IO6WgH63ej55vHKwdjOWKJg2LNKdQ1I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T09:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "PayPal: We’ll ‘Definitely Support’ Bitcoin If It Becomes ‘Better Currency’", "text": "1 hour ago Crypto and Laws Bitcoinist 10 The CFO of PayPal defended the case for fiat merchant settlements Monday, telling mainstream media the company could nonetheless “definitely support” Bitcoin in the future.

Rainey told Mad Money host Jim Cramer: Because of the volatility of the cryptocurrencies, if you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept Bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction.

Since that time, Bitcoin volatility has curbed considerably, while merchant practices of instantly converting funds to fiat – a practice Rainey also highlights – could also soon change. As Bitcoinist reported this week, advances in Bitcoin’s currency capabilities in the form of the Lightning Network continue to pressure both merchant processors and fiat-based solutions with conspicuously lower fees and near-instant transaction processing times. Braintree, which charges on average 2.9% plus a $0.30 flat fee per transaction, became the subject of a direct comparison to Bitcoin payments via Lightning-enabled payment tools, which incur zero costs to the merchant. Lightning remains in its infancy, with a total network capacity of just under $170,000. Rainey meanwhile signaled that PayPal was not about to give up on Bitcoin. He added: Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information. Also read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem American bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues. A director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks. “There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week. Think about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well. DSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings Further, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency’s Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated: “DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,” explains the Defense Department. There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell’s email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance. University of California Researcher: ‘Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion’ Individuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don’t necessarily make a person risky. “I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk,” Aftergood explains. However, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. “Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” Weaver said this week. It’s also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a ‘security risk’ have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company’s employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.

Two Pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins On 17 May 2010, computer programmer Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the Internet a request to buy a pizza paying with bitcoins. A few days later, Hanyecz was successful. He bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins from Jeremy Sturdivant, whose username was “jercos.” On May 22, 2010, Hanyecz posted on Bitcointalk forum, “I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Thanks, jercos!” As of this writing, 10,000 bitcoins equals USD $82,000,000. But when Hanyecz performed this transaction, he may have been unaware of its significance. Since then, Bitcoin has faced innumerable challenges. Governments and influential financial leaders have attacked Bitcoin relentlessly throughout its existence. Scandals involving nefarious people using Bitcoin have often occupied the world press. Moreover, technical issues, including scalability and expensive transaction fees, have led the crypto community into a terrible civil war. However, Bitcoin has shown great resiliency and has successfully confronted all these challenges. Therefore, it remains the most successful ever currency. For example, new technological improvements such as SegWit, Lightning Network, and Atomic Multi-Path Payments over Lightning, and now Bitcoin Core 0.16.0, are solving Bitcoin’s scalability and transaction fee issues. In this regard, Hanyecz made another spectacular contribution to the development of the cryptocurrency by buying a pizza again on February 25, 2018. However, this time, he performed the transaction via Lightning Network. Hanyecz, reported this transaction as follows: I paid bitcoin using the lightning network, and he arranged for a pizza to be delivered to me. In this trade, my friend is just a middleman that is taking the risk of accepting lightning payments, but it demonstrates the basic premise of how this works for everyday transactions. It could just as well be the pizza shop accepting the payment directly with their own lightning node. The Transaction That Changed the World Indeed, the first-ever Bitcoin transaction changed the world of finances. Last year Bitcoin, escorted by futures trading contracts, entered into the circle of mainstream finance. This milestone event was formalized by the CBOE Global Markets’ launch of Bitcoin futures contracts, on December 10, 2017, easing the way to the cryptocurrency market for institutional investors’ trillions of dollars. As a result, big banks and financial institutions are now aiming to trade Bitcoin. For example, according to Amber Baldet, former J.P Morgan executive, big banks will soon start trading cryptocurrencies. In a recent interview with CNBC, Baldet said, “I think it is coming sooner than people probably think.” Goldman Sachs might also be on the path of start trading Bitcoin. The New York Times writes : But Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank. On the other hand, Bitcoin exchanges, such as Coinbase and Ivy Koin are moving to obtain bank licenses. Reportedly, Coinbase is already introducing over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading services. Today, the world celebrates the anniversary of Hanyecz’s first Bitcoin transaction. The crypto community remains optimistic that Bitcoin will continue demonstrating resiliency, by outperforming all fiat currencies, even if articles with titles such as “Bitcoin is dead” will keep coming.

Also Read: Crypto Revolution Starts Reshaping Global Politics Historical Precedents The main question Shiller was trying to answer is how cryptocurrency users can maintain a high level of enthusiasm in the face of constant warnings that it’s all just a big scam. Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money. Putting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate. And while novel ideas by communist and technocratic thinkers have failed, the Euro – which was devised to help unite former warring nations – is still around. Revolutionary Zeal Is Not Enough Nobel Prize Laureate Robert J. Shiller After reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: “Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.” “And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,” he concluded. Whether it’s true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.

The protection of client anonymity is the top priority at BestMixer.io and to that end they are the only Bitcoin mixer service offering total security for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash. Watch this fascinating short video about the basic principles of the BestMixer work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYDTKpTkCs Bitcoin and the ever-expanding cryptocurrency asset class represent a thriving market and revolution in the way value is transacted. Blockchain, the technology which underpins cryptocurrency, is an immutable and trustful ledger of ongoing events, making all transactions public. Because all transactions are attached to the wallets that send and receive bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the anonymity of such transactions is shallow at best, creating a sea of easy targets for cybercriminals and surveillance. “BestMixer.io disguises where your coins have come from, making it impossible to study your digital track,” say the BestMixer team in their Wiki. “On a global scale, to maintain the best level of anonymity, you need to mix your coins every time you are going to send or get them from a new source.” Coins are deposited into a reserve containing the coins of other depositors and then tumbled, resulting in a break between the sending and receiving addresses and mixed, untraceable coins. Importantly, the Bestmixer.io bitcoin tumbler offers three reserves (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) for mixing, each providing a different source for mixed coins. The Gamma Pool, for instance, is restricted to BestMixer.io’s private reserve and investor coins, meaning coins mixed using this pool feature anonymization plus the guarantee of a reliable source. The ramifications for privacy-oriented cryptocurrency users are undeniable as bad actors using identifying data to target and surveil wallets are effectively shut out. Until now, the majority of bitcoin mixer services fell short of their promises to provide total anonymity to users. “The comparative analysis of most mixers in the market today obviously showed that all of them, except for a few, are exactly the same,” said the BestMixer.io team in a recent announcement. “And do they give anonymity to the cryptocurrency that they promise? The answer is negative!” Adding to the already long list of features offered by Bestmixer.io bitcoin mixer, several languages are supported including English, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and German. The team has recently improved its support system, modified the Mixing Strength Meter, which is a crucial feature, enhanced the Q&A section and the randomization of miners’ fees, among other functions. New modules and improvements are under way. Tor-friendliness means users concerned with end-to-end privacy will find the Bestmixer.io experience intuitive and seamless.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYDTKpTkCs"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T07:45:09.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7828e44ffcaf177c08810843f96860813ccedbde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCz6slgzoa.obq8YvYVPteZ0IJ5nblXwl2t46JHOU38VPrs6sJ8uSVRATGoH4KvskZCRXWzsjXEB8-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning", "title_full": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning", "published": "2018-05-23T09:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527026910_84458737.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7828e44ffcaf177c08810843f96860813ccedbde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCz6slgzoa.obq8YvYVPteZ0IJ5nblXwl2t46JHOU38VPrs6sJ8uSVRATGoH4KvskZCRXWzsjXEB8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T09:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning", "text": "6 hours ago International Bitcoin.com 23 CNBC’s Fast Money hosts and panel were on the defensive during a recent broadcast, as some viewers accused the network of shilling for bitcoin cash (BCH). And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused. Also read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon Wednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders. Trader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth. Mr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects. He also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide Ultimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.” Ms. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change. Yet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment. The strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That’s all excusable, and there’s always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his. Yikes.

Here we explore the ten strangest Bitcoin forks.\nSource: BitMEX Research\nBitcoin Pizza (BPA) Bitcoin Pizza (BPA) incorporates DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) technology used by IOTA with a short 120 second block time for faster confirmations. It went live on January 1, 2018, with block 501,888 – granting every bitcoin holder the same amount of BPA.\nBitcoin Ore (BCO) Bitcoin Ore (BCO) is aiming to be a less wasteful and more environmentally friendly version of Bitcoin. Based on Proof of Capacity, it enables to be mined more efficiently, thereby saving the environment. It started to be operational on January 28, 2018, granting each bitcoin holder the equal amount of BCO.\nBitcoin Faith (BTF) Bitcoin Faith (BTF) brings a built-in intelligent contract, larger block size and zero-knowledge proof for privacy. Forked from block height of 500,000, on December 19, 2017, it granted every bitcoin owner an equal amount of BTF.\nOil Bitcoin (OBTC) By \"drilling the oil from digital currency,\" Oil Bitcoin (OBTC) aims to issue rewards by using Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to enhance trading speed and equity distribution. With Autonomous Community, Safeguard Privacy and Replay Protection it was issued on December 12, 2017, granting each bitcoin holder an equal amount of OBTC.\nSuper Bitcoin (SBTC) Implementing the proposals recommended by the community, Super Bitcoin (SBTC) aims to provide zero-knowledge proofs to safeguard privacy and expand the block size to 8MB. Furthermore, support Turing-complete smart contracts it enables more functionality, increasing BTC scalability. It was forked on December 12, 2017, with the block 498,888, granting every Bitcoin holder the equal amount of SBTC.\nBitcoin Hot (BTH) Created at block height 498,848 with a new Proof of Work algorithm – BTHash, Bitcoin Hot (BTH) aims to reduce the cost of transfers while increasing the speed. It holds larger supply than bitcoin, making it more affordable for everyone. Every bitcoin owner can claim their BTH with a ratio of 100 BTH for every bitcoin they hold. The block size is 16MB, and the project was established in December 2017.\nBig Bitcoin (BBC) Big Bitcoin or BBC claims to operate at \"extremely high speed with considerably powerful technology\" while being one of the \"most in-depth hard forks of the Bitcoin blockchain ever seen.\" BBC has a shorter block time (2.5 minutes), bigger block size (16 MB) and adapts a difficulty adjustment algorithm while supporting SegWit and Lightning Network . BBC was forked at block height 508,888, and the supply is fixed at 210 million.\nBitcoin Clean (BCL) Bitcoin Clean (BCL) is another attempt to make Bitcoin clean and green again with a tagline \"Mine bitcoin solely using renewable energy.\" It employs 'Proof of Greenness Protocol' to ensure miners use only renewable energy.\nForked at block height 518,800 on April 18, 2018, it granted every bitcoin holder the same amount of BCL. The team behind it claims to work nonstop to make this fork a genuinely viable alternative to Bitcoin and curb the pollution being generated due to mining .\nBitcoin File (BIFI) Aiming to create a global decentralized file system, Bitcoin File (BIFI) combines IPFS file systems and the Bitcoin settlement network. Fully self-monitored and decentralized, it offers 21 billion tokens, among which 17 billion were airdropped to the bitcoin holders with the ratio of 1000 BIFI for every bitcoin held. It claims to be a more stable, fair and green alternative to BTC.\nBitcoin Candy (CDY) The newest fork out there – Bitcoin Candy (CDY) combines a Proof of Work algorithm with a two-minute block time for increased transaction speeds. Claiming to be safer with total supply adjusted to 21 billion, it was distributed with block 512666.\nThe distribution took place on January 13, 2018, on the Bitcoin Cash chain with a ratio of 1000 CDY for every 1 BCH. Furthermore, the coin conducted an additional hard fork on May 15, 2018 ( along with Bitcoin Cash ), incorporating some significant upgrades to the chain.\nConclusion While some take it as a great sign that many bitcoin forks are trying to solve existing problems, others argue they are all distractions from the bona fide version; there will only be room for one form of sound, honest money and the network effects backing bitcoin make it the strongest contender.\nThe only requirement for receiving the forked coins is to own bitcoins at the time of the fork while storing it on a separate, non-exchange wallet. Every bitcoin fork (even those ridiculous) could be a great way to make additional money, but many are scams designed to enrich their founders or steal your funds.\nWhile the number of bitcoin forks since Bitcoin Cash is at 44 presently, this number could easily reach 100 by the end of 2018 as 'fork mania' persists.\nThe post Bitcoin's been Forked 44 Times Since Bitcoin Cash: We Explore the Ten Strangest Forks appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "iota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bpa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmex research bitcoin pizza", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:14:38.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30441499ad1fa7dc6f69dfa2cc0cb728b0d6c4aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_H5HBDheaWcwKcvLWAg8oWcFvGG0_rypfry08mx..O2yKiMWjUIRxxEXTAW2S114g--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Brian Kelly: Now is the Time to Invest in Bitcoin Cash", "title_full": "Brian Kelly: Now is the Time to Invest in Bitcoin Cash", "published": "2018-05-23T09:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30441499ad1fa7dc6f69dfa2cc0cb728b0d6c4aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_H5HBDheaWcwKcvLWAg8oWcFvGG0_rypfry08mx..O2yKiMWjUIRxxEXTAW2S114g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T09:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Brian Kelly: Now is the Time to Invest in Bitcoin Cash", "text": "According to crypto trader Brian Kelly, now is the right time to invest in Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The founder and CEO of cryptocurrency trading firm, BKCM LLC envisages an increase in the value of the most popular bitcoin fork.\nValue Creation will Drive Price Increase Speaking to CNBC , Kelly predicted an impending bull run for Bitcoin Cash. He based his assertions on the decisions reached during the recent meeting of Bitcoin Cash miners in Hong Kong. The miners agreed to set aside as much as five percent of the block reward for mining towards funding Bitcoin Cash development projects.\nAccording to Kelly, this decisions by the miners is a positive development for Bitcoin Cash, saying :\nThat's how blockchains gain value. You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for Bitcoin Cash.\nThe BKCM CEO expects the increase in use cases of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to drive prices up. With more utility on the blockchain, developers will be incentivized to create useful solutions that run on the network. Thus, Kelly thinks now is the time for traders to consider Bitcoin Cash seriously. The crypto has surged from $760 in April to crossing the $1,000 threshold in May, reaching a high of $1,600 on May 6.\nThe Bitcoin Cash Development Fund The fund is aimed at supporting programmers who develop useful protocols on top of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. During the meeting a few days ago, the top figures in the Bitcoin Cash community including Calvin Ayre and Roger Ver tabled discussions about the funding mechanism for the initiative. Apart from the percentage block rewards contribution, participants also agreed to a voting process to determine what projects to implement. The decision to adopt a treasury model for accruing donations for the development fund bears a striking resemblance to the one used by Dash developers.\nNo decision has been made on the specific percentage to be used for the donations. However, a simple analysis shows that a one percent block reward contribution amounts to about $650,000 per month on average, provided Bitcoin Cash prices do not fall below $1,200. At the time of writing this article, BCH prices have declined by six percent in the last 24 hours.\nDo you agree with Brian Kelly's analysis that more use cases will provide value for BCH thus driving prices upward? Will the Bitcoin Cash Development Fund initiative lead to the creation of intuitive protocol solutions on the BCH blockchain?

seemed to have some crazy story they heard about Bitcoin. \"Did you hear about that dude from our Finance class...?\" or \"There was this guy in San Jose that...!\" always something mildly disturbing, unbelievable, but somehow hilarious. Of course that was only the start. After more and more research online in the deepest of Reddit boards, crypto blogs, and the always entertaining YouTube comments section we found even more ridiculous anecdotes of what people around the world thought of Bitcoin (most people online are VERY passionate about their beliefs).\nWe decided after collecting all these quotes from 'Bitcoin Believers' and 'Headstrong Haters' that we would put the most entertaining on a version of our card game exclusively for Kickstarter. Never again to be produced. Only for backers. But we need your help: throughout the whole campaign we want software developers, bitcoin investors, and average joe to tell us their crazy story or crypto quote and you'll get the chance to have your quote and name immortalised in Kickstarter glory. Submit your quote and get your name on our card game!\nBitcon started when Brandon and Sam, two friends from uni (also known as Two Stupid Investors...), were sitting eating a particularly delicious sushi lunch one Wednesday afternoon. After a long discussion of the new Bitcoin craze we decided we’d heard enough idiot stories about uneducated lunatics investing all their money in cryptocurrency. As crypto investors and entrepreneurs working in-depth with blockchain ourselves, we have had a deep knowledge of Bitcoin and the community for years. Whilst we’re big believers(!) that blockchain technology is the future of financial transactions we’re completely astounded by the landscape of individuals investing in Bitcoin.\nThe turning point came one day when we heard that a friend had taken out a $7,000 government university loan in order to invest it into bitcoin. Uneducated, non-financially stable, high risk, the shady characters putting money they didn’t have into a financial instrument they didn’t even begin to understand scared the shit out of us. And so we decided to satire all the stupid bitcoin scams, cons, and investing stories we heard and create this crazy game. Now you can lose all your money, without losing all your money!\nWe wanted to create a game for ourselves, our friends, our family, and the world that educated people on the realities of investing in cryptocurrency, and allowed for the thrills of being a big money investor with zero risk. With thousands of hours of practice gameplay and countless redesigns of the game, Bitcon is our perfect representation of what it feels like riding markets up and down, using strategy to protect yourself but also attack opponents, and be ready to cash out your position before your investment is fully lost. Its 15 minutes of pure strategy, pace, and gambling. Betting addicts we’ve found you a solution.\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com Risks and challenges\nWe want your game in your hands as soon as possible. Simple as that. We've done all the research on manufacturing to make sure that you receive a professional quality game of Bitcon that gives you and your friends the best gameplay experience. To get early feedback on printing and colouration we printed multiple prototype decks to understand how the graphics and colours look and feel on the cards, and gameplay has been thoroughly tested over thousands of hours. Design work can be slightly tweaked after the campaign based on your feedback, however a professional quality designed game is ready to be printed tomorrow!\nOur biggest challenge would be fulfilment at high scale, but we've projected fulfilment and shipping to all areas of the world for that eventuality and feel confident that we wont subtract from your experience as a founding contributor to Bitcon. This wont be one of those campaigns that takes three years to get your reward.\nWe respect you are just as important as us in being founders of this game, and as such will keep the whole community frequently updated throughout the process.
