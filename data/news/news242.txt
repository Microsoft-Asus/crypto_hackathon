Steve Helber/AP The world's bitcoin network uses enough cooling fans and manufacturing hardware for mining that it's expected to use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the end of 2018. That's about as much power as the entire country of Ireland uses in energy — and it's expected to reach the same consumption level as Austria. In the next six months, we may see bitcoin using as much electricity as a major industrialized nation.\nAt this point, mining bitcoin requires such intensive, specific hardware that the only way for most people to get in on the crypto game is to simply purchase the coin via an exchange. But that doesn't mean mining has slowed down. Rather, the opposite has been happening, giving environmentalists (and anyone but the most adamant cryptobros) cause for concern.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware, and the outrageous, ever-rising energy costs needed to operate a bitcoin mining rig, the world's bitcoin network is expected to use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the end of 2018, according to new research and models . That's one two-hundredth of all the electricity used on the planet. And that's terrible.\nLet's put that another way. According to that research, which is admittedly based on some imperfect assumptions and averages, the bitcoin network currently uses about as much power as the entire country of Ireland (which uses 3.1 gigawatts) and is expected to grow to the same energy consumption level as Austria, which is currently at 8.2 gigawatts.\nThe world's population is right around 7.6 billion people. If everyone used the same amount of energy (which they don't but bear with me) that would put bitcoin's energy consumption — and toll on the environment — at the same level as that of 38 million people.\nNow, this certainly doesn't mean that bitcoin should be cancelled. And while it seems like nothing can convince crypto fans that bitcoin is anything but the way of the future, these findings show just how much of an impact the cryptocurrency is having on the world. And not a \"we're gonna take back the financial markets and build a better tomorrow!\" kind of impact. More of a tangible \"oopsy-daisy, we're accidentally scorching the planet\" kind.\nIf cryptocurrencies are truly going to become the money of tomorrow, then we'll absolutely need to grapple with the environmental damage caused by this major energy suck (assuming the price of bitcoin continues to climb). Or, figure out how to mine more efficiently. Because again, in the next six months we may see bitcoin using as much electricity as a major industrialized nation.\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos. Chicken farm in South Korea\nIn South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts. Sponsored Links\nOn April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city. An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.\nBy disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed. Image source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani\nIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.\nThe group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.\nPreliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.\nCurrently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates. First mining ban in New York\nIn the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.\nThe city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:\n“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.” Another cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said:\n“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”\nAt the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks. Not illegal\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.\nCryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries. YiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and “guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner” by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protection\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) January 6, 2018\nIt is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions. This is why South Korean authorities are currently drafting regulations to prevent mining facilities from taking advantage of cities with cheaper electricity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cryptocurre", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nam yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:06:29.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8b21ce2bfa38bafe0c013481de3e8c2f0f6f7d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf_8X7vE4VpraAxHEbta0FBvprdLVxuNxx0w8cHBfwYAXJ0C1pOodHSjD4V0GaztR7DR3KSeqOtr81AAS04QekDuXJVA00orY3.Xcui40eVfO", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "China Ranks Ethereum as the World’s Best Blockchain Network, Bitcoin at #13 - Latest Cryptocurrency", "title_full": "China Ranks Ethereum as the World’s Best Blockchain Network, Bitcoin at #13 - Latest Cryptocurrency", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.446, "main_image": "https://latestcryptocurrency.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ethereum-futures-ether-price.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8b21ce2bfa38bafe0c013481de3e8c2f0f6f7d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf_8X7vE4VpraAxHEbta0FBvprdLVxuNxx0w8cHBfwYAXJ0C1pOodHSjD4V0GaztR7DR3KSeqOtr81AAS04QekDuXJVA00orY3.Xcui40eVfO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "China Ranks Ethereum as the World’s Best Blockchain Network, Bitcoin at #13 - Latest Cryptocurrency", "text": "China Ranks Ethereum as the World’s Best Blockchain Network, Bitcoin at #13 Advertisement\nOn May 17, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released its public blockchain ratings, ranking various blockchain projects like Ethereum in the global cryptocurrency sector based on three criteria: technology, application, and innovation. Bitcoin at #13\nAs shown in the chart below, the Chinese government ranked Ethereum as the world’s best blockchain network at number 1. The top five included Ethereum, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo, all of which utilize smart contracts to efficiently and securely process information in a decentralized manner. 4/ Detailed scores of the first crypto ratings by CCID Research, China's Ministry of Industry & Information Technology pic.twitter.com/7LiJIWokge\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) May 17, 2018\nThe addition of Steem in the top five rankings of the Chinese government’s blockchain network was unexpected by the community because unlike Lisk and NEO, Steem is not a base layer blockchain technology that can be used to create decentralized applications. Steem is a content distribution platform based on the blockchain with a primary purpose of distributing content. Essentially, Steem is like Reddit based on the decentralized blockchain.\nAnother surprising addition to its top 10 rankings was Monero at number 9, given that several governments including the Japanese government and its financial services agency (FSA) have expressed their concerns towards cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash that are capable of processing anonymous payments that could be associated with money laundering and criminal activities.\nThe cryptocurrency community was taken aback by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, which was co-ranked with privacy-focused cryptocurrency Verge. The bitcoin community was understandably outraged by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, considering that bitcoin has the longest track record as the most secure and dominant cryptocurrency in the global market.\nThe argument that bitcoin’s application is limited to a form of money and payment is illogical, as the Chinese government ranked Steem, which has a single application on its blockchain network that is a content distribution platform, as the 2nd best blockchain network behind Steem.\nMore importantly, bitcoin has one of the most active open source development communities in the global cryptocurrency sector and it has developed innovative technologies like Confidential Transactions (CT), Bulletproofs, and Lightning Network, which allows developers to enable private transactions, process micro-payments, and with solutions like RootStock, potentially allow bitcoin to function as an Ethereum-like smart contracts platform. Exceeded Expectations\nThe majority of the cryptocurrency community expected the Chinese government to rank private blockchain networks and protocols that can assist the government in surveillance or monitoring transactions at the top. Hence, the ranking of the government which placed cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Monero demonstrate the intent of the government to remain objective in its assessment.\nHowever, analysts have stated that the Chinese government has overlooked the long track record, hashrate, computing power, and accumulated difficulty of major blockchain networks like bitcoin and prioritized next-generation blockchain networks instead.\nEarlier this month, South China Morning Post, a major publication based in Hong Kong, reported that China’s public blockchain rankings were developed by China Center for Information Industry Development (CIID), an institute that works closely with the government to advise on policymaking in technology.\nThe high ranking of Ethereum and smart contract blockchain networks could influence the government to potentially allow some blockchain networks to operate in China.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "informati", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:59:35.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "429d459775bb6c86fda5477c21cd92adaa58192d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrvqxpYSj0qRVqy7jhkaZYuTPHl.43.nptVp..edp8ARC79WWxMVt6nJv5qwWtZJVTUlmC9dY.hKw_oI3PQnLNGbSX1fNHh36u9quk91_zM4uos4_PCe2OX", "site_full": "stocksmasters.com", "site": "stocksmasters.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal - Stocks Masters", "title_full": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal - Stocks Masters", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://stocksmasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_177476195.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "429d459775bb6c86fda5477c21cd92adaa58192d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrvqxpYSj0qRVqy7jhkaZYuTPHl.43.nptVp..edp8ARC79WWxMVt6nJv5qwWtZJVTUlmC9dY.hKw_oI3PQnLNGbSX1fNHh36u9quk91_zM4uos4_PCe2OX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal - Stocks Masters", "text": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal On May 17, 2018 Share\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is approaching 2000 functional nodes as users begin to highlight the conspicuous cost savings using the technology.

Speaking to the audience at Consensus, Mr. Dorsey painted a very prosperous future for Bitcoin , and told the audience he believes that Bitcoin could become the native currency of the internet.\nJack Dorsey, speaking to a crowd of cryptocurrency enthusiasts , showed he was completely in sync with their view that digital currencies are the way of the future.\n“The internet deserves a native currency; it will have a native currency,” Dorsey, the chief executive officer of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., said Wednesday at Consensus, a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in New York City. “I don’t know if it’ll be Bitcoin or not,” he said, but “I hope it will be.”\nThis wasn’t the first time Dorsey had spoken fondly of digital currencies. The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.

The first signs of people messing around with the new features came from the Memo and Blockpress developers as both platform’s increased posting character limit from 79 to 217. Both Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters.\nThis means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain. Then shortly after the fork, another OP_Code feature was shown to the community by Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia. The First Tree Signature on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nPacia built the first tree signature on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain by utilizing the OP_CAT functionality — which creates a more efficient multi-signature combination. The Openbazaar programmer explains for addresses with a large number of keys, a tree signature can use less data. “For addresses with a large number of keys a tree signature can use less data. And unlike normal OP_CHECKMULTISIG, it doesn’t require you to expose the keys that were not used in the signing,” Pacia explains to the BCH community on May 15. Moreover, Pacia shows his demonstration via a block explorer URL which indicates it was a 1 of 8 multi-sig tree signature. Chris Pacia’s multi-sig tree.\nMany individuals were very impressed with the new multi-sig operation that shows innovation in multi-signature technology, and one that could add more BCH privacy in the future. Pacia details his example is a subset of MAST — which stands for ‘Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees.’ MAST could improve BCH privacy because certain multi-sig scripts could be kept hidden.\n“This is like a subset of MAST,” Pacia explains.\nMAST is more general but can’t be done with the current opcodes as far as I know — If we had OP_EVAL then we could I think. An OP_Code Puzzle With a Message in the Script\nAfter the tree signature our Chief Technology Officer, Emil Oldenburg, also experimented with the Satoshi OP_Codes and created a ‘transaction puzzle.’ When the puzzle is solved it contains a secret message within the hashed script.\n“I made a fun little transaction puzzle with one of the new OP_Codes,” Oldenburg explains .\nThe puzzle is solved with the string “BCH is the best Bitcoin”. The script is <String1><String2> OP_XOR OP_HASH256 <hash1> OP_EQUAL. It’s solved by finding the secret String1 that when XORed with String2, after hashing should be equal to hash1. Etching the Bible’s 23,000 Verses Into the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nLastly, another anonymous user is pushing the ‘arbitrary data spam debate’ to the ultimate level. The Twitter handle UK Cryptocurrency showed the cryptocurrency community that a BCH address is currently writing the first testament of the King James Bible to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain at 1sat/Byte. Looking at the Bitcoin Cash transaction ID its Memo states:\n1 In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.\nTransactions following this continue to be written in the BCH chain with each verse that’s found in the King James Bible. This address is etching the entire Bible into the blockchain.\nUK Cryptocurrency estimates that the entire Bible may cost around $100 USD (0.08 BCH) and add around 8MB to the BCH chain. Of course, many Bitcoin Cash fans were excited to see the many OP_Code developments unfold so fast and expect more innovative ideas will sprout down the line.\nWhat do you think about all the OP_Code experimentation over the past day? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, Reddit, the Bitcoin.com Block Explorer, and Blockpress.\nWant to see all those Memo posts and OP_Codes in the BCH Chain?

Bitcoin and its peers were hit hard on Wednesday after search engine Bing announced plans to ban cryptocurrency-related advertising on its platform. This follows similar moves by Facebook, Google, and Twitter earlier this year.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has dropped 2.1% since this time yesterday to US$697.69 per token, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$69.4 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price is off 1.8% over the last 24 hours to 69.3 U.S. cents, giving it a market capitalisation of just under US$27.2 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has been the worst performing major coin over the last 24 hours with a 5.9% decline to US$1,270.71. Bitcoin Cash now has a market capitalisation of just under US$21.8 billion. The popular altcoin has come under heavy selling pressure since it successfully completed its Bitcoin ABC upgrade. This seems to be a case of buy the rumour, sell the news.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has tumbled 5.3% to US$12.40, reducing its market capitalisation to US$10.7 billion. The rising star of the crypto world has fallen heavily since Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) CFO, Rob Jesudason, quit his role with the bank to join the company behind the EOS cryptocurrency.\nOutside of the top five there was a sea of red. In fact, only one coin in the top 20, TRON (TRX), has pushed higher during the period.\nIt is up 2.5% since this time yesterday, while Litecoin (LTC) is down 1.4%, Cardano (ADA) has tumbled 5.3%, Stellar (XLM) is off 6.5%, and IOTA (MIOTA) is down 5%.\nWhat’s next?\nSentiment appears to be getting increasingly weaker at the moment, which unfortunately could be a sign that there are more declines on the horizon.

People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus — which represents revolution and change — from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they’re moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it’s not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter — proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he believes.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,” he said. “Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines earlier this month for the same reason: he bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shake-up is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on significant zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n“My dad studied astrology and I’ve been learning about for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,” he said. “Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.”\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst — which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors — said he expects bitcoin BTCUSD, -1.86% to fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his clients they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based astrology alone.\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,” he told MarketWatch .\nMerriman believes planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement , which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius — a sign of “new ideas and machines.” From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20% of investors at large make decisions based on horoscopes — a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults believe astrology is a science . Merriman himself has more than 1,000 clients and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n“It doesn’t worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,” he said. “If you look at correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you’d be amazed.”\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women’s website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,” she said. “Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don’t. Founders of popular astrology app Co-star told MarketWatch they shy away from any kind of financial advice because it can have major effects on people’s lives. Still, Gat noted, it’s a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n“Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,” she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=4", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:23:13.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf731c535844972bcaa71bb7a3b6a5a20a205cd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3klB4q9Qgio8UBfA96r7u8-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf731c535844972bcaa71bb7a3b6a5a20a205cd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3klB4q9Qgio8UBfA96r7u8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite active friends who will invite their friends - and start making real money!

The company that provides OTC solutions to institutional buyers can now operate freely in New York — A territory that many call, ‘the financial capital of the world,’ as Genesis aims to provide significant BTC, BCH, ETC, LTC, ZEC, XRP, and ETH liquidity in the state.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features DCG Backed Genesis Global Trading Granted New York State Bitlicense\nGenesis Global Trading has announced the firm has been granted the Bitlicense, and the company will be allowed to operate in New York with other approved businesses such as Coinbase, Circle, and Itbit. The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) approved the company and provided Genesis with the Bitlicense — which will allow the firm to trade the various digital assets it holds with institutional investors. Before the company was granted the Bitlicense the firm operated under the DFS “safe harbor” provision.\nGenesis was launched in 2013 and is backed by the venture capital organization the Digital Currency Group (DCG), a firm founded by Barry Silbert. The company is a regulated cryptocurrency OTC dealer that “provides access to institutional investors and high net worth individuals looking to buy or sell large sums of digital currencies.” Genesis has offered deep pools of liquidity, 24-7 trading, and same-day settlement since the company’s inception.\n“We are very pleased that DFS has approved the Genesis Global Trading BitLicense application,” said Michael Moro, CEO, Genesis Global Trading.\nAlthough we have operated under a safe harbor provision in recent years, today’s decision is an important step forward and reaffirms the robust compliance measures we have enacted as an established trading partner. Barry Silbert Hopes More Cryptocurrency Businesses Are Approved in NY Barry Silbert .\nTo use the Genesis platform, traders have a $75,000 USD minimum deposit, and all users are subject to AML and KYC regulatory guidelines. In addition to being an approved brokerage service that can sell Bitcoin Core (BTC), the DFS has also approved to procure Zcash (ZEC), Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC).

SEC's Fake ICO Dupe\nIn its latest bid to warn investors of the dangers of investing in illegitimate initial coin offerings (ICOs), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) created a fake website with a fake offering. The parody site, HoweyCoins.com , mocks ICOs and has a fake eight-page white paper with fake celebrity endorsements and a fake management team working the ICO. HoweyCoins.com features all of the language and guarantees the SEC warns against, including a \"complex yet vague explanation of the investment opportunity\" and a countdown clock ticking down as \"time runs out\" on the deal. When site visitors click the button to buy coins and invest in the ICO, they are instead directed to an SEC page with investor tips and education tools. JP Morgan Launches Crypto Strategy\nJP Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) has moved Oliver Harris, former head of the bank's fintech and in-residence programs, to a new position aimed at uncovering the uses of cryptocurrency across corporate and investment banking branches, according to Financial News . The move comes a few months after JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon scaled back earlier criticisms of crypto, in which he called the digital assets \"frauds.\" Harris' new role also follows a similar move by Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS ) , which recently recruited trader Justin Schmidt to head a new crypto derivatives trading unit. JP Morgan employees were alerted to 29-year-old Harris' new role through an internal memo released Wednesday. Harris is set to report to Umar Farooq, the bank's head of blockchain initiatives.\nJPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

( SQ ) cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey said at Consensus 2018 this week that he wants bitcoin to become the \"native currency\" of the internet. \"I'm just approaching with the principle that the internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don't know if it will be bitcoin. I hope it will be bitcoin. I'm a huge fan,\" said Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ) . Dorsey added that his team at Square has often debated whether bitcoin will become the basis for all online payments in the future, adding that the mobile payments company has \"led with that mindset.\" Dorsey continued, \"But there's still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that's where the magic happens, where the creativity happens.\" Celebs Used to Promote Crypto Scams\nHouston-based Wind Wide Coin was issued an emergency cease-and-desist order from Texas watchdogs following allegations the startup attempted to dupe investors with false advertisements from celebrities. Wind Wide reportedly created fake client profiles using images of high-profile people including actress Jennifer Aniston, Prince Charles and former Finland prime minster Matti Vanhanen, according to the Texas State Securities Board . The Texas-issued order also accused the firm and three individuals of claiming to be licensed in the state, of selling unregistered securities, of misleading investors and of withholding information.

It’s estimated that cryptocurrency mining can consume as much as 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by the end of this year, according to economist Alex de Vries .\n“The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts),” de Vries said. “Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.”\nUsing a series of mathematical models that take hardware, electricity, and cooling costs into account, de Vries was able to approximate total energy consumption using upstream chip production numbers. In the past, more accurate energy estimates were not possible because of the secretive nature of Bitcoin mining facilities, which keep their operations behind closed doors.\nSo much energy is required in mining because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Because cryptocurrency relies on a peer-to-peer network to keep records of transactions, energy is needed to power large distributed networks of computers.\n“Those computers collectively perform quintillions of calculations per second, each “mining,” trying to solve a math problem that will give it the right to form the next block on the chain,” Live Science said of the process. “And the winner every 10 minutes is rewarded with 12.5 Bitcoins. That’s more than $100,000 at the coin’s current exchange rates.”\nTo capitalize on the rewards, miners need to have facilities with numerous computers dedicated to mining, and these computers generate heat. In addition to the energy consumed to mine, these systems also require a significant amount of energy for cooling. In the past, it was estimated that the power required to mine for a single Bitcoin could power your home for an entire week. To help offset some of the cooling costs, operations like Miner One want to locate mining facilities in cooler climates, like in Sweden. Another startup is using the heat generated from mining to warm your home as an alternative to using energy to cool mining facilities.\nBecause of the high cost associated with mining, a university researcher misappropriated the institution’s hardware and electricity to obtain $8,000 to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, which incurred a total cost of approximately $150,000. In another example, a mining facility in Russia was suspended for not paying for several million kilowatt-hours of electricity.\nAs a result of rising cost, malicious agents may be motivated to steal energy for their own mining operations. However, there will still be some who will continue to mine for Bitcoin at a loss, and those people may be motivated by ” libertarian ideology (supporting a payment network that does not rely on a central authority), or speculative reasons.” As energy costs continue to rise, cryptocurrency mining may no longer be a profitable enterprise.

People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus — which represents revolution and change — from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they’re moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it’s not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter — proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he believes.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,” he said. “Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines earlier this month for the same reason: he bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shake-up is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on significant zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n“My dad studied astrology and I’ve been learning about for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,” he said. “Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.”\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst — which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors — said he expects bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.11% to fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his clients they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based astrology alone.\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,” he told MarketWatch .\nMerriman believes planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement , which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius — a sign of “new ideas and machines.” From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20% of investors at large make decisions based on horoscopes — a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults believe astrology is a science . Merriman himself has more than 1,000 clients and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n“It doesn’t worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,” he said. “If you look at correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you’d be amazed.”\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women’s website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,” she said. “Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don’t. Founders of popular astrology app Co-star told MarketWatch they shy away from any kind of financial advice because it can have major effects on people’s lives. Still, Gat noted, it’s a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n“Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,” she said.\nMore from MarketWatch What America’s gun fanatics won’t tell you Damn the torpedoes — what could take the S&P 500 to 3,000 Home sellers now use spycams to gather intel on prospective buyers", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=4", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:25:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc1fe5217fd449820e471d79748dd5f38d670d21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.weOEF.fKh7EhWsnFJVjuCaaYeZrMj9R5Q7SRsqZ0_nidnXkTUzxxmLr2GpYjoUbVDxMJU5lJMz8nOQQrZFEf1I5Tmnx59MHV9K6bR2WwCP9tYAYkDAe0M.vwFlYT42CT9xkCrEw_Nfw--", "site_full": "whtc.com", "site": "whtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | News | 1450 99.7 WHTC", "title_full": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | News | 1450 99.7 WHTC", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.079, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/17/2018-05-17T191021Z_1_LYNXNPEE4G1M2-OUSBS_RTROPTP_3_BUSINESS-US-CRYPTO-CURRENCY-INDEX.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc1fe5217fd449820e471d79748dd5f38d670d21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.weOEF.fKh7EhWsnFJVjuCaaYeZrMj9R5Q7SRsqZ0_nidnXkTUzxxmLr2GpYjoUbVDxMJU5lJMz8nOQQrZFEf1I5Tmnx59MHV9K6bR2WwCP9tYAYkDAe0M.vwFlYT42CT9xkCrEw_Nfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | News | 1450 99.7 WHTC", "text": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index Thursday, May 17, 2018 3:10 p.m. EDT Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTE\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com .\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whtc ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:12:24.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "826d8f9ea6d6e16daeb3da8b814f7ecd5fef4ca3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAElcd04LGYjJgPqyUH0JEvg3iPMG.O7oM9qLK19yulmHJ7ck6f2H1gPGzHZ1f_s9RSluXcXjMkD0NO92a0Hd0COU-", "site_full": "www.zerohedge.com", "site": "zerohedge.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Iran Looks To Bitcoin As Rial Tumbles | Zero Hedge", "title_full": "Iran Looks To Bitcoin As Rial Tumbles | Zero Hedge", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/17-8-23-94213%D9%85%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-720x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2435, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 78, "comments": 0, "shares": 78}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "826d8f9ea6d6e16daeb3da8b814f7ecd5fef4ca3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAElcd04LGYjJgPqyUH0JEvg3iPMG.O7oM9qLK19yulmHJ7ck6f2H1gPGzHZ1f_s9RSluXcXjMkD0NO92a0Hd0COU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iran Looks To Bitcoin As Rial Tumbles | Zero Hedge", "text": "Authored by Michael Kern via SafeHaven.com,\nAmid sanctions fears, Iranians have reportedly spent over $2.5 billion on cryptocurrencies to get their cash out of the country in a new form of digital capital flight.\nThe Iranian version aired on state-run media was buried at the bottom on a long discourse on cryptocurrencies, and downplayed as to its significance, but it comes as the Iranian rial plunges to new lows against the U.S. dollar, the climax of which has been Trump’s formal announcement of a withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\n\"No virtual national currency has been designed in the country at the present and based on the existing data few people in Iran are cryptocurrencies' customer and more than 2.5 billion dollars has been sent out of the country for buying digital currencies, added point most of the digital currency activists enter this arena because of the huge benefits and speculation\" Chairman of the Economic Commission of the Parliament Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi said.\nShortly after Trump’s announcement last week , the rial nose-dived to 85,000 to 1 US dollar, down from 57,500 rials to 1 US dollar at the end of April, and 42,890 at the end of last year.\nSince April, Iran has been attempting to get in front of a sell-off, first unifying official and free-market exchange rates and freezing the rate at 42,000, while banning all other trading in the currency, under threat of arrest.\nThe rial is expected to dive further on news Tuesday that the U.S. has sanctioned Iran’s central bank head.\nLate last week, the U.S. levied sanctions on a financing network, accusing the Iranian central bank of helping funnel U.S. dollars to its Quds Force elite military unit, which is on a U.S. blacklist.\nThis was followed by another move on Tuesday that saw terror sanctions slapped on the head of the Iranian central bank, Valiollah Seif, whom Washington has accused of secretly funneling millions of dollars through an Iraqi bank to help Hezbollah. The sanctions also include bank senior official Ali Tarzali. Both have been listed as “specially designated global terrorists”.\nAt the same time, Iranian government moves to head off a currency crisis could lead to further capital flight via cryptocurrencies.\nOn Monday , the Central Bank issued a new directive setting stricter limits on the amount of foreign cash travelers can take with them out of the country. Travelers can leave Iran by air now with only $5,980 (5,000 euros, or the equivalent in any foreign currency). The new amount halves the previous amount allowed. Leaving by land, rail or sea has a limit of $2,392 per person.\nAlso in April , the central bank banned the country’s banks from offering services to cryptocurrency firms or from dealing in cryptocurrencies domestically. This has led to a flourishing business for cross-border crypto deals with Iranian citizens desperate to get their money out.\nWhile the initial justification for the ban was to thwart money-laundering and terrorism financing, the Iranian Financial Tribune quoted an Iranian official as saying that the move was intended to stop capital flight.\n“The ban on trade of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin by CBI, as the financial and currency regulator of the country, is to prevent the flight of foreign currency under the current circumstances of the country.”\nNow that the original ban has backfired and possibly led to increased capital flight, the government seems to be wavering, suggesting that the policy might not be set in stone and a new regulatory framework should be in place by the third quarter of this year.\nIn the meantime, capital flight will be hard to stop, especially considering that all of the government’s recent actions undo their liberal economic policymaking of the past years.\nTags Business Finance Politics", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael kern", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mohammad reza pourebrahimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "safehaven.com", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "economic commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:11:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2ccc6c0dd4ee206fea65e24d8c2ad7f9ab2d1c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRH2AqLxng9kZpwrwEnItcjPSHXSfykmF6VfrO8JGH0QljW5dKb6whrJodcDx13ZHEi7qpwojBEgQ--", "site_full": "www.domain-b.com", "site": "domain-b.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin mining expected to use half a per cent of global power by end of 2018 - domain-b.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin mining expected to use half a per cent of global power by end of 2018 - domain-b.com", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2ccc6c0dd4ee206fea65e24d8c2ad7f9ab2d1c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRH2AqLxng9kZpwrwEnItcjPSHXSfykmF6VfrO8JGH0QljW5dKb6whrJodcDx13ZHEi7qpwojBEgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin mining expected to use half a per cent of global power by end of 2018 - domain-b.com", "text": "Bitcoin mining expected to use half a per cent of global power by end of 2018 17 May 2018\nBitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value. But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there. \"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users. His estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts — as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5 per cent of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\" Bitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins — a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power. \"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries says. It's figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium. Other researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner's costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And, while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive. \"Sometimes the best information we've got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That's the stuff we have to work with,\" he says. Still, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the US have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining. \"But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it's very forward-looking. It's focused not on the now, but on where we're headed. And I think that's something you really need to know if you're going to draft policy about it,\" he says. He also points out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable. We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I'm doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:54:27.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87c28c6c038acb5f9a4c3bcc617405479ea7d5b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdMlTohNEFLAB6r6lVsqlP7U8QyWeMgwlZRynwVlbqefwDE.nyCvy7xfSjgM4vBXqQHaHxYEStBBtnIDMtYZ90TwjxV_9EgQeMfWaj7oxEkyRqVVs9w.nQ.ztCxz4LaMSdMjDPMjm1dY2cYf.PY_pGBbMws11teWY-", "site_full": "www.theweek.in", "site": "theweek.in", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin case: Court issues non-bailable warrant against former BJP MLA | Bitcoin case former BJP MLA | Bitcoin case gujarat", "title_full": "Bitcoin case: Court issues non-bailable warrant against former BJP MLA | Bitcoin case former BJP MLA | Bitcoin case gujarat", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2018/5/17/nalin-kotadiya-ani.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 87042, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87c28c6c038acb5f9a4c3bcc617405479ea7d5b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdMlTohNEFLAB6r6lVsqlP7U8QyWeMgwlZRynwVlbqefwDE.nyCvy7xfSjgM4vBXqQHaHxYEStBBtnIDMtYZ90TwjxV_9EgQeMfWaj7oxEkyRqVVs9w.nQ.ztCxz4LaMSdMjDPMjm1dY2cYf.PY_pGBbMws11teWY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin case: Court issues non-bailable warrant against former BJP MLA | Bitcoin case former BJP MLA | Bitcoin case gujarat", "text": "By Nandini Oza May 17, 2018 21:57 IST [File] Nalin Kotadiya | ANI\nA special court in Ahmedabad on Thursday issued a non-bailable warrant against former Gujarat MLA Nalin Kotadiya, who is allegedly involved in a multi-crore bitcoin case.\nThis follows a representation by the CID Crime that is investigating the case.\nDGP of CID Crime Ashish Bhatia said that if needed Kotadiya would also be declared an absconder and his property could also be attached.\nFormer BJP MLA Kotadiya is missing and he has also left his cell phone back home to avoid getting tracked by the police and other agencies.\nThe CID Crime is investigating a case based on a complaint lodged by Surat-based builder Shailesh Bhatt. The builder in his complaint had said that he was abducted as part of a conspiracy to “takeover” his 180 bitcoins. These bitcoins are worth over Rs 10 crore.\nDuring investigation, the police found that the money trail led to the MLA. One of the main accused, Kirit Paladia, who was also a former business partner of Bhatt, had reportedly encashed over 30 bitcoins and some money was also given to Amreli Police.\nThe police has already arrested Amreli SP Jagdish Patel in connection with the case.

LedgerX , a well-known asset management platform, is the first to offer a Bitcoin savings account to the masses. This venture is fully regulated by the CFTC and will target consumers looking to buy and hold cryptocurrency in a safe and secure way. A Smart Decision by LedgerX\nBitcoin companies have to come up with new and innovative ways to get consumers excited about cryptocurrencies. So far, this has been an ongoing battle, even though the momentum is shifting in favor of cryptocurrency, albeit ever so slowly. It is a painstaking process and one that will not necessarily become easier anytime soon. That is, not unless LedgerX has a say in it.\nThis cryptocurrency asset management platform is heading in an interesting direction as of right now. While it has been clear for some time that the company wants to make cryptocurrencies more accessible, few people expected the firm to launch a Bitcoin savings account. Its new venture is not just a custodial service, but rather a CFTC-regulated savings account for consumers looking to buy Bitcoin and hold it long-term.\nWhat this means is that LedgerX now allows investors to earn interest on their Bitcoin holdings. Similar to how traditional savings accounts work, the new Bitcoin savings account service incorporates a call overwrite. It is a feature accessible to all users, although not a mandatory function by any means. Investors can deposit Bitcoin to LedgerX and sell a call option at a later date with a higher strike call option. It is a very popular service in the financial world today, and will seemingly gain traction in the cryptocurrency world as well.\nAlthough that is an ‘advanced’ feature, LedgerX is making it a lot more accessible in the form of a point-and-click function. Those who are bullish on Bitcoin long-term will reap the benefits of this method, as their existing portfolio will slowly appreciate in value and users selling the option will earn a premium amount. It is not a method which is useful to everyone by any means, although there seems to be interest in the venture already.\nConsidering that the CFTC is seemingly cracking down on Bitcoin services, this new development offers some hope to the industry. A lot of unlicensed companies are providing cryptocurrency services, yet users are not protected if anything goes awry. LedgerX provides an additional layer of security to users, which can only be considered a positive development. It is also a clear indication that the cryptocurrency industry continues to mature.\nThe bigger question is whether or not this will lead to more long-term Bitcoin holders in general. If it does, Bitcoin’s price may experience an uptrend in the future. The majority of its volatility is due to short-term trading, which is still the preferred method of trading for speculators. More mature investors are looking at the bigger picture, which indicates that holding Bitcoin for the long term still yields better results.

On May 16, the Second World Intelligence Conference cosponsored by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Internet Information Office, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the China Association for Science and Technology and the Tianjin People’s Government was held at the Tianjin Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center. At the meeting, Jack Ma, chairman of the board of Alibaba group, said, “I think that blockchain is not a bubble, Bitcoin is. We don’t have a deep understanding of blockchain technology. Today, blockchain is not a huge gold mine, but a solution, solution to solve data and privacy security, create value for the society. Now many people regard it as something to make money making, and that’s the end. I am personally very optimistic about blockchain technology and have been studying for several years. I didn’t understand it at all, but when I heard it could solve the problem of privacy security, Alibaba did research. We have the most patents for blockchain technology. We have trillions of transactions. Without security guarantee, it will lead to severe consequences. “ Jack Ma also stated that “We need to use the blockchain as a thing that brings value to society, then it can become wealth. Blockchain can provide many guarantees for the government, enterprises, and the people. This is where its true value lies.” Before Jack Ma said Bitcoin was a bubble, Buffett, Bill Gates, Munger, and others have already been declinists about it. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett called Bitcoin a “rat poison,” saying that cryptocurrencies would not have a good ending, he wouldn’t have Bitcoin, and he would never buy it. Bill Harris, chief executive of Paypal, a well-known payment company, is also “bad-mouthing” Bitcoin and calling it a deception. So, what do you think?

Bitcoin, Ethereum, ICO, Blockchain & Cryptocurrency News", "text": "Daily Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, ICO, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency News Posted on by nCrypto Square Embraced Bitcoin After Twitter CEO Jack Attended a Hackathon\nJack Dorsey has some very interesting opinions when it comes to Bitcoin. He thinks it will become the world’s single currency in ten years from now. However, his companies have always been adverse to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That recently came to change when Square integrated Bitcoin support. It seems there is a good reason as to why the company decided to gamble on cryptocurrency after all. Square Embraces Bitcoin Thanks to Jack Dorsey\nA lot of people were surprised when Square enabled support for Bitcoin. Its Cash app lets users buy and sell BTC with relative ease. It has been a positive decision for the company. Revenue has increased ever since this implementation was added. Even so, the key reason for this integration has always been a mystery.\nIt appears Jack Dorsey has been intent on integrated Bitcoin with Square Cash for some time now. Earlier this year, attending a hackathon finally opened up a lot of perspectives. Together with engineer Mike Brock, they embarked on a mission to bring the Square Cash Card and Bitcoin together. The purpose was to make BTC as spendable as real currency without too many hurdles. It is not an easy task, as payment cards and cryptocurrency do not work well together these days.\nAfter eventually succeeding, the decision was made to take it to the next level. Brock, the engineer, leads a team working on Square Cash’s Bitcoin brokerage features. It is evident the company and the world’s leading cryptocurrency will remain entwined for some time to come. This is mainly due to Jack Dorsey’s fascination with Bitcoin and what it represents. Bitcoin Checks the Right Boxes\nThese days, it is difficult to keep shareholders happy. In the case of Square, a lot of people continue to oppose cryptocurrency. These same individuals still question the decision to offer Bitcoin support in an official capacity. Jack Dorsey, however, wants to offer even more functionality in the near future. What those features will look like, remains unclear.\nBitcoin is an interesting form of money for Jack Dorsey. Earlier this year, he stated how BTC can become the world’s “one’ currency in the next decade. It may become the single currency of the internet, and by extension, the rest of the world. An ambitious goal and a bullish outlook. The global interest in cryptocurrency is surging as of late. Even so, it is still mainly for investment purposes, rather than using it as a currency.\nThe question remains whether or not Jack Dorsey can drive this change Bitcoin really needs. It still remains inaccessible to a lot of people. Square Cash addresses that problem in a way, but not on a global scale just yet.

REUTE\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com .\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:15:34.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7daea4b1c1f17146ae45bbc82625f4b9c2f17b3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1maBOD54xYVTtVQ37_V1Qs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "title_full": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7daea4b1c1f17146ae45bbc82625f4b9c2f17b3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1maBOD54xYVTtVQ37_V1Qs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nBecome the person, who referred the largest number of new users till the end of June 1, 2019 and we will give you 0.3 BTC.

Echoes Of Weiss?\nThe ratings , which rank an initial tranche of 28 assets by three criteria – technology, application and innovation – come courtesy of what Beijing referred to as “domestic experts” earlier this month.\nThe project is under the control of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s China Electronic Information Industry Development department (CCID).\nHaving only announced ratings plans at a Beijing conference May 11, the results have appeared in record time, but may be set to frustrate certain members of cryptocurrency industry as China’s experts ranked Bitcoin in thirteenth place.\nEven more curiously, below Ethereum at the number one spot, second came Steem, the crypto token used by the Steemit social network.\nThese were followed by Lisk, NEO and Komodo respectively. NEM’s XEM token came in at twenty-eighth place. Ethereum ‘Typical’ Says Chinese Press\n“The results show that the typical representative of the second-generation blockchain technology is Ethereum’s technology assessment index with a smart contract function of 129.4, ranking first in the assessment list, and the evaluation index is ranked second to fifth,” local news outlet China Electronics News summarizes linked by social media resource CnLedger. 1/ Public blockchain ratings by China’s ministry is out: #Ethereum ranks top of the 28 cryptos evaluatedSource (in Chinese): https://t.co/9jStIiFKcc\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) May 17, 2018\nThe unlikely underperformance of Bitcoin in the ratings echoes the results of the world’s first such endeavour from Weiss Ratings earlier this year.\nThe agency’s findings caused a furore when they appeared in January, Bitcoin receiving an overall score of ‘C+’ (later upgraded to a B-) while Ethereum also topped its list with a ‘B.’\nOther famous names also failed to impress China meanwhile, Litecoin attaining only twenty-first place, four places ahead of Bitcoin Cash.\nEthereum Classic was sixteenth, Ripple seventeenth and Dash eighteenth, while Bytecoin achieved twentieth.\nWhat do you think about China’s cryptocurrency ratings?

This allows creators to earn with viewership and users to earn from watching videos and ads. The platform recently headed to Hong Kong, to participate in Block O2O , a summit that saw people from all over the world coming together to discuss about the current state and future of blockchain.\nBlock & Fintech O2O and Viuly\nBlock O2O and Fintech O2O where blockchain conferences hosted for entrepreneurs, engineers, financers, economists and regulators who discussed the present and the future of blockchain technology. The summit will be attended by more than a hundred investors, 100 speakers and 1800 delegates from 30 different countries.\nThe summit was held in PMQ , in the heart of the fashion and entertainment district of Soho, Hong Kong. The colonial Married Police Quarters has been redesigned as a state of the art conference centre. The summit was held for two days on 8th and 9th of May .\nThe team attended several closed investors meetups, these were organised for the team to pitch the Viuly project to potential partners and investors.\nIgor Glavatskiy, Zahid Ali and Andrei Druta presented the project on stage, and outlined what was achieved by VIULY for last four months and what their roadmap holds in store for the future on the closed meetup after the event.\nThe team appreciate everyone who took part in making the memorable event happen.\nOKEx Meeting\nThe Viuly team visited the OKEx headquarters in Hong Kong, where the team met with professionals from OKEx crypto-exchange. The Viuly team were really glad to meet the highly skilled and energised team.\nAs a participant, Viuly will showcase its video sharing platform to other participants, meet up with other blockchain platform teams and enthusiasts and generally discuss about how the technology is reshaping the world.\nVideos On Blockchain: Viuly\nViuly uses blockchain technology to drive its video sharing platform. Through it, Viuly achieves a faster smarter and an efficient way of not only sharing videos, but allowing monetization of the content.\nWith blockchain, Viuly eliminates the need of an intermediary service provider. This means there are no commissions or heavy fee involved when content creators want to charge for their videos and channels. More money for creators also translate into more contents\nFor viewers, this means that there is more content to watch. Donations sent by viewers to their favorite creators is also free of any cuts. Viewers are also awarded for watching videos.\nThe third major effect is that without any middleman, advertisers can run their ads more cheaply.

Unfortunately, this is also true if one uses Bitcoin to exchange for fiat currency. Bitcoin is not immune from State or Federal laws regulating the flow of money, and agents can track bitcoin transfers over the blockchain .\nAlso read: Bitcoin Advocates Prepare to Fight the California Bitlicense\nThese facts have become more apparent in the last few years as at least 4 people have been arrested and charged with financial crimes related to the “illegal” transmission of Bitcoin.\nAll the cases involved individuals allegedly exchanging Bitcoin for a fee. Some of the individuals advertised these services online in a furtive or overt fashion. They were caught after local or federal agents began an investigation, and sometimes after the “suspects” transferred bitcoin to an undercover officer for a fee. However, sometimes there was not even an investigation, only suspicion and an ill-gotten warrant. Recent Cases of Bitcoin Transmitter Crimes\nMissouri Case\nIn a recently circulated case, a Missouri man pleaded guilty to conducting an unlicensed and unregulated money transmitter service. The man, Jason R. Klein, posted advertisements on the internet to exchange Bitcoin for cash. The Missouri attorneys office statement said,\nBetween Feb. 6, 2015, and July 27, 2016, Klein, acting with another, met with two undercover federal agents on numerous occasions to exchange bitcoin for cash. Today’s plea agreement cites five separate transactions in which money (ranging from $1,000 to $15,000) was exchanged in person for an electronic transfer of bitcoin. Each of the transactions included a fee that Klein or another person charged the undercover agents, for a total of $2,122 in fees.\nKlein is subject to receive a penalty of up to five years in prison without parole.\nArizona Case\nIn another recent case covered by Bitcoin.com, an Arizona man named Thomas Constanzo, AKA Morpheus, was accused of possibly running an illegal money transmitter service…but was only charged with possessing “60 cartridges of ammunition.” Some think this is more a politically-motivated charge, since alleged crimes of illegal money transmission were not leveled. A warrant for running a money transmitter service was issued alongside the arrest for the ammo cartridges.\n“A warrant signed by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Duncan sought evidence that Costanzo may have operated an “unlicensed money transmitting business,” engaged in illegal drug sales, and tried to hide any profits.”\nConstanzo was considered a “flight risk” and was not provided the opportunity for bail.\nOhio Case\nIn a more complex case, an Ohio man named Daniel Mercede was charged with using stolen credit card information to buy concert tickets and resell them for a profit. After a prolonged investigation involving a home search, cops learned of ongoing money transmitter crimes. Allegedly, agents figured out that Mercede was purchasing large quantities of Bitcoin from overseas exchanges and reselling them at a premium. An FBI article about the case explained what they found and the sentence they handed down,\n“Court records show Mercede wired funds to make daily purchases of $10,000 and $40,000 in bitcoin. Over six months beginning in August 2014, Mercede illegally converted or transmitted $1.4 million. He was sentenced on March 21 to more than six years in prison. The case represents one of the first convictions for what is believed to be an increasingly frequent crime—operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.”\nNew York Case\nIn a New York case that occurred between 2014 and 2015, a man on probation for transferring child pornography, named Richard Petix, pleaded guilty to running an “illegal money transmitting business” and “making false statements.”\nOn December 3, 2015, Petix conducted a bitcoin exchange with a federal agent in Buffalo, New York. He sent 37 bitcoins to the officer, worth about $13,000 at the time. He was also on probation, and allegedly lied about having access to the computer where the transaction occurred. The New York attorneys office summarized his activities,\n“Between August, 2014, and December 3, 2015, Petix conducted over 100 Bitcoin transactions wherein he transferred over $200,000 in bitcoins to customers both locally and across the United States. At least some of these customers then used the bitcoins to purchase controlled substances from dark net vendors. At no time during this period did Petix comply with federal money transmitting business registration requirements.”\nThese cases represent a government crack down on the use of bitcoin to exchange cash for a fee, although in some cases the transmitter service was stumbled on by accident (Mercede) or not found at all (Constanzo).\nNeedless to say, government has become aggressive in regards to thwarting illicit use of Bitcoin by underground, black market actors. They are now willing to hand out warrants or conduct investigations even if the evidence is tentative, nonexistent, or amounts to a witch hunt.\nGovernments also have the tools and understanding to track bitcoin addresses and obtain computers that harbor wallets. Currently, it seems ill-advised for anyone to attempt to transfer bitcoin in exchange for cash. In the least, anyone interested in subverting government laws should acknowledge that Bitcoin is only pseudo-anonymous and digital currency trails can be traced.\nWith that said, government possessing authority to tell people how to spend their money is a controversial subject. Many have decried government assaults on these “criminals” as an attack on individual liberty, a person’s right to their property, and ability to spend their money how they see fit.\nDo you believe even more people will be arrested for operating “illegal” bitcoin exchanges in the near future? Do you believe people should be punished for spending their money as they see fit?

From there we have a nice bounce, but overall and for now, the Bitcoin doesn’t look very positive for the short term.\nWe’ll look closer on the $9,400 support level that was tested yesterday, and more important is staying above the support level at $9,000.

He helps financial services senior executives, board members, startup operators, hedge funds, and venture investors make strategic decisions about FinTech, Cryptocurrency, and Innovation.\nIn the 21st century, cryptocurrency is very controversial given its new technology which people know very little of but it is really here to stay, says Lex Sokolin.\nIn his expert opinion, he says the underlying technology is really fundamental for the types of companies people are building right now. For any person who is thinking about investing in Bitcoin, the understanding of what Bitcoin refers to is very important. He must understand how the blockchain works and also understand how payments work.\nHe further says an investor must know whether Bitcoin is fulfilling the promise of enabling digital payments. The price is very volatile in the market. Therefore, an investor must not go and fill his whole portfolio with cryptocurrencies but it is a good alternative to add to his general allocations. The total investment in cryptocurrency in the portfolio must be around three to five percent.\nLex Sokolin says:\n“For advisors when you think about cryptocurrencies. Your clients are going to buy Bitcoin whether you like it or not. So you can choose to say that this whole thing will fall apart not get educated on it, not help people but that’s really irresponsible.”\nThe advisors should start understanding the basics of how the blockchain works, understand why there are differences between the cryptocurrencies. For example, what is the difference between a payments coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum which is a smart contracts platform? All these things are different.\nThe advisors have to spend the time to formulate simple answers to the clients’ questions which can better the understanding of the client before investing and give them a logical reason to invest so that they can help the clients make sense of this new technology.\nAman Swami is an Economics major from Christ University.

Required fields are marked * Comment ‘The internet deserves a native currency like Bitcoin [BTC]’– says Twitter CEO\nPublished Aman Swami Source: Flickr\nThe Blockchain week in New York witnessed many notable speakers. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc was also one amongst the long list of speakers at the event. During the event, he spoke to a crowd of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to show he was completely in sync with their view that digital currencies are the way of the future.\nDorsey, said on Wednesday at Consensus, a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference:\n“The internet deserves a native currency; it will have a native currency. I hope it will be Bitcoin”\nMany in the audience at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Dorsey also mentioned that there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nDorsey has spoken with great enthusiasm about digital currencies many times before and propagated the new technology. He also tweeted in 2016 that he would ‘love to see a digital currency thrive’. In his role at Square, he has promoted cryptocurrency many times. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin trading was available for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nAs Dorsey was about the move not everyone at Square was as enthusiastic.\nHe said:\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company.” Square Reported:\n“In first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin at the beginning of this month the company made $34.1 million , but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning we only made about $200,000.”\nDorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s Blockchain Week:\n“This technology is a fundamental shift in our world and can have so many positive outcomes. We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lex sokolin bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lex sokolin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "autonomous research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:47:12.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76f6b3dc301c6ff895758dee0e4d0bcfc41a14b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvoKcHUCNB1_qXcAkUWHRaBhU8fs5J.dRpvmc68HIMixY3qUB1i5cQhn.jABaAQsB06pBUPadptvukgVG8qqVQJm9F3DlVlw5yipNF17oQzdLOr_5yaA3sl_3p9wExae4vlXLnf2FdCAL8p3zm67dxkw--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/news/forex-economy/cryptocurrencies/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Markets : News, Economy &amp; Forex, Cryptocurrencies - 4-traders.com", "title": "Cboe Global Markets : Conducts May Settlement of Bitcoin Futures", "title_full": "Cboe Global Markets : Conducts May Settlement of Bitcoin Futures | 4-Traders", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76f6b3dc301c6ff895758dee0e4d0bcfc41a14b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvoKcHUCNB1_qXcAkUWHRaBhU8fs5J.dRpvmc68HIMixY3qUB1i5cQhn.jABaAQsB06pBUPadptvukgVG8qqVQJm9F3DlVlw5yipNF17oQzdLOr_5yaA3sl_3p9wExae4vlXLnf2FdCAL8p3zm67dxkw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cboe Global Markets : Conducts May Settlement of Bitcoin Futures", "text": "CHICAGO, Illinois , May 16 -- Cboe Global Markets , an exchange holding company, issued the following news release:\nCboe Global Markets, Inc.

Pay with Bitcoin or Power a Home?\nPublished on May 16 on Joule , de Vries made use of complex economic models, coupled with publically available electricity costs and mining statistics, with the intentions of producing a scientific paper that companies and individuals can base their research on.\nAccording to de Vries, the worldwide minimum current requirement of Bitcoin is 2.55 gigawatts, equivalent to the electricity usage of Ireland, the world’s 118th largest country by landmass. The researcher also states that this amount equals to half a percent of the world’s total electricity usage. The report suggests that bitcoin mining power consumption this year could equal the usage of Austria.\nFurthermore, every transaction via the Bitcoin network uses up enough electricity to power an average home in the Netherlands.\nDe Vries, who currently works with PwC Netherlands, believes that the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency may end up using 7.7 gigawatts to power its network by the end of this year, a figure equal to the electricity usage of Austria! Bad for Bitcoin, Bad For Climate\nThe huge costs associated with Bitcoin mining – a process that “timestamps” transactions and performs extensive calculations – has been a subject of criticism since years. And with the increase in the network’s size, the costs are further poised to grow, possibly consuming 5 percent of the world’s total electricity in the future.\nDe Vries notes:\nYou are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines.\nApplying economic principles to the Bitcoin protocol highly suggests the network reaching a point of equilibrium, which would see the miner’s bitcoin incentives become equal to the computing, hardware, and electricity costs involved.\nWith that in mind, de Vries extrapolated present data to that of the equilibrium point, to determine electricity costs and economic implications in running the Bitcoin network during that period Sources May Have Skewed Results\nA telling point remains that of utilizing public data, which de Vries feels could be misleading. Mining companies like Bitmain are highly secretive operations, and official documents pertaining to their operations are largely unavailable.\nHowever, de Vries is confident of his prediction, and says:\nSometimes the best information we’ve got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That’s the stuff we have to work with.\nThe researcher believes that his paper can be referred to by governments and regulatory bodies prior to placing restrictions or introducing laws, as its peer-reviewed, scientific nature supersedes that of anecdotal evidence and weakly researched publications.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world’s electricity energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world's electricity energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:19:42.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a390f39d2f1fb3d131dfee361b1e367c6b0e88ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velkRbXWvMfblO7IpFh4LPwb", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "Hundreds of Bitcoin Wannabes Show Hallmarks of Fraud", "title_full": "Hundreds of Bitcoin Wannabes Show Hallmarks of Fraud | Hacker News", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.924, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a390f39d2f1fb3d131dfee361b1e367c6b0e88ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velkRbXWvMfblO7IpFh4LPwb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hudon", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hundreds of Bitcoin Wannabes Show Hallmarks of Fraud", "text": "- The space is littered with fraud.\n- Wallets have bugs that lose hundreds of millions of dollars\n- Energy consumption forecasted to hit 0.5% of the world’s electricity consumption by end of 2018\n- Promoters yelling “decentralize everything” while exchanges, development teams and mining are all highly centralized\n- No legal use case found to date\nBlockchain is a parasite on society.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:03:42.099+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f6512c35ee923a83eb6c7d22bd8ad87d73177b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS631Pg7Nx2WkkgDCpFTIPFE-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f6512c35ee923a83eb6c7d22bd8ad87d73177b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS631Pg7Nx2WkkgDCpFTIPFE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nShare the link to CryptoTab with your friends and get extra earnings in BTC depending on their earnings.

The donations — whether in bitcoin or another digital currency – would be subject to the same state limits as a cash donation, and the value would be determined at the time of the contribution.\nSecretary of State Wayne Williams made the proposal in draft rules presented this week. The move follows the lead of the Federal Election Commission and others states – New Hampshire was the first – which began to allow candidates to accept donations of cryptocurrency in 2014.\n“The FEC is doing it now,” said Suzanne Staiert, Colorado’s deputy secretary of state. “So we are just going along for the ride.” U.S. Rep.\nJared Polis, D-Boulder, now a candidate for governor, said he was the first member of Congress to accept bitcoin, when he received about $2,000 worth for his 2014 re-election campaign. An FEC advisory opinion, which sets the road map for Colorado’s proposal, lays out complicated accounting rules that consider the cryptocurrency an in-kind donation and makes clear that contributions above the aggregate limit for individual donors would need to be refunded or returned.\n“It’s going to be an accounting problem, potentially, for campaigns who want to use it,” Staiert said. A Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Missouri accepted the largest bitcoin donation in December 2017.

Dorsey said there will ultimately be a native internet currency, and the adoption of bitcoin or another crypto as a global currency would help Square expand its services into new markets. Dorsey said he is a “huge fan” of bitcoin and hopes it ends up as the universal digital currency.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that, after reviewing 1,450 digital currencies, it found 271 cryptocurrencies that had evidence of fraudulent activity. Nearly one out of every five currencies the Journal investigated utilized fake executive information, plagiarized documents, fabricated development team credentials or other misleading information in an attempt to raise money from unsuspecting investors.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has completed an ICO of a satirical cryptocurrency called HoweyCoin as part of an effort to warn investors about the dangers of investing in cryptos. The HoweyCoin website was set up to demonstrate to investors how easy it is to get duped into the many scam currencies that have popped up in recent months, and the site links to an educational page about how to avoid crypto scams.\nPrice Action The Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC (OTC: GBTC ) traded at $13.62, down 0.9 percent.\nHere’s how several top crypto investments fared Thursday. Prices are as of 3:45 p.m. ET and reflect the previous 24 hours.\nBitcoin declined 1.4 percent to $8,200; Ethereum declined 1.8 percent to $686; Ripple declined 1.9 percent to 67 cents; Bitcoin Cash declined 3.9 percent to $1,225; EOS gained 3.4 percent to $12.79.

Today, a conservative estimate indicates that bitcoin mining currently consumes as much electricity as Ireland, Mark Zuckerberg will meet with the European Parliament, someone appears to have secretly begun CFC production again and more.\nNew research into the energy consumption of bitcoin indicates that, by the end of the year, the cryptocurrency could account for 0.5 per cent of the world's energy demand: 7.67 gigawatts, roughly the same as that consumed by Austria ( Motherboard ). Financial economist Alex de Vries's conservative estimates, based on the energy consumption of the most efficient bitcoin miner available, show that the bitcoin network currently consumes at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity – as much as Ireland. But the miner network is growing at an extremely fast rate. Bitcoin's value and the energy required to mine it both change over time, but on March 16, about 60 percent of the bitcoin value produced by a miner was spent on electricity and de Vries anticipates that when the network reaches 7.67 gigawatts, it will hit a point of equilibrium, where miners are only able to break even.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with leading members of the European Parliament to discuss data privacy concerns ahead of GDPR coming into force ( BBC News ). A date has yet to be set for the meeting, but it's most likely to take place next week. Zuckerberg is also scheduled to meet French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on May 23 but has thus far rejected demands by Britain's government to appear before Parliament to give evidence about Facebook's enabling of the Cambridge Analytica data siphoning scandal.\nA new paper on an unexpected rise in ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons has shockingly concluded that someone, somewhere has once again begun production of the banned chemicals ( Ars Technica ). Research carried out by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the ongoing drop in levels of CFC-11 since its 1987 ban has slowed dramatically, indicating that the gas is once again being produced and released. Speaking to BBC News , leap author Dr Stephen Montzka identified east Asia as the likely source of the emissions, observing that \"we are making the measurements from very far away from these regions and I think more specificity is going to come once the people... in that region...look carefully at their measurements and publish their results.\"\nIn December 2016, David Hidalgo received a photograph of a 17th-century Peruvian painting ( WIRED ). The unsigned artwork, of the Virgen de Guadalupe , depicts the Virgin Mary surrounded by apparitions and tells the story of her appearance to Saint Juan Diego near Mexico City in 1531. Hidalgo’s tip-off came via email from a source who had seen the painting on show at the Bowers Museum in California, where it was on loan. Hidalgo’s source suspected that the painting had been stolen.\nMicrosoft's new Xbox Adaptive controller looks like a DJ mixing console at first glance ( Motherboard ). Large enough to cover your lap or sit secure on a table thanks to its grippy rubber feet, it's designed to meet the needs of gamers with a wide range of mobility-limiting conditions. It has a directional pad, the usual Xbox and menu buttons, and a pair of large, domed buttons that can be easily pressed with whatever body part the player users, even if they have very little strength and coordination. The $99 controller is also set up to work with external peripherals for foot control and more.\nJimmy Broadbent was working late at night on April 14 when everything suddenly went dark.

Although the block dimension enhance is kind of a feat, BCH builders have additionally expanded the community’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some outdated Satoshi OP_Codes that had been beforehand faraway from earlier codebases. Now over the previous 24-hours, a number of folks have been enjoying round with the brand new BCH options.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features Experimenting With the New Bitcoin Cash OP_Codes\nLots of BCH neighborhood members have been discussing the brand new OP_Code options and the extra house added to the community’s default data-carrier-size. The first indicators of individuals messing round with the brand new options got here from the Memo and Blockpress builders as each platform’s elevated posting character restrict from 79 to 217.\nBoth Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters.\nThis means customers of each social media functions can now submit extra content material and the whole lot is saved on-chain. Then shortly after the fork, one other OP_Code function was proven to the neighborhood by Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia. The First Tree Signature on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nPacia constructed the primary tree signature on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain by using the OP_CAT performance — which creates a extra environment friendly multi-signature mixture. The Openbazaar programmer explains for addresses with numerous keys, a tree signature can use much less information. “For addresses with a large number of keys a tree signature can use less data. And unlike normal OP_CHECKMULTISIG, it doesn’t require you to expose the keys that were not used in the signing,” Pacia explains to the BCH neighborhood on May 15. Moreover, Pacia exhibits his demonstration by way of a block explorer URL which signifies it was a 1 of eight multi-sig tree signature.\nChris Pacia’s multi-sig tree.\nMany people had been very impressed with the brand new multi-sig operation that exhibits innovation in multi-signature expertise, and one that would add extra BCH privateness sooner or later. Pacia particulars his instance is a subset of MAST — which stands for ‘Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees.’ MAST may enhance BCH privateness as a result of sure multi-sig scripts could possibly be saved hidden.\n“This is like a subset of MAST,” Pacia explains.\nMAST is extra common however can’t be executed with the present opcodes so far as I do know — If we had OP_EVAL then we may I believe. An OP_Code Puzzle With a Message within the Script\nAfter the tree signature our Chief Technology Officer, Emil Oldenburg, additionally experimented with the Satoshi OP_Codes and created a ‘transaction puzzle.’ When the puzzle is solved it accommodates a secret message inside the hashed script.\n“I made a fun little transaction puzzle with one of the new OP_Codes,” Oldenburg explains .\nThe puzzle is solved with the string “BCH is the best Bitcoin”. The script is <String1><String2> OP_XOR OP_HASH256 <hash1> OP_EQUAL. It’s solved by discovering the key String1 that when XORed with String2, after hashing ought to be equal to hash1. Etching the Bible’s 23,000 Verses Into the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nLastly, one other nameless person is pushing the ‘arbitrary data spam debate’ to the final word degree. The Twitter deal with UK Cryptocurrency confirmed the cryptocurrency neighborhood BCH deal with is presently writing the primary testomony of the King James Bible to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain at 1sat/Byte. Looking on the Bitcoin Cash transaction ID its Memo states:\n1 In the start, God created the heaven and the earth.\nTransactions following this proceed to be written within the BCH chain with every verse that’s discovered within the King James Bible.\nThis address is etching your entire Bible into the blockchain.\nUK Cryptocurrency estimates that your entire Bible might value round $100 USD (zero.08 BCH) and add round 8MB to the BCH chain. Of course, many Bitcoin Cash followers had been excited to see the numerous OP_Code developments unfold so quick and anticipate extra progressive concepts will sprout down the road.\nWhat do you consider all of the OP_Code experimentation over the previous day? Let us know what you consider this topic within the feedback under.\nImages by way of Shutterstock, Reddit, the Bitcoin.com Block Explorer, and Blockpress.\nWant to see all these Memo posts and OP_Codes within the BCH Chain?

I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.\nDorsey also added that he is a “huge fan” of the growing industry and supports the technologies which help to assist cryptocurrencies and related developments. Square CEO Jack Dorsey wants his company to be at the forefront of getting cryptocurrency accepted as legitimate means of global payment. https://t.co/xfIYMAgNak\n— CNBC (@CNBC) May 16, 2018 Tech Giants vs ICO Advertisements\nDespite the CEO’s positive outlook on the cryptocurrency space, Twitter has shown a negative attitude toward the release of cryptocurrency-related ads on their service, banning ICO and cryptocurrency crowd sale advertisements in March.\nA Twitter spokesperson gave CNBC a statement on the matter, saying:\nWe are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.\nThis announcement came after similar announcements from Google and Facebook, who also banned ads related to cryptocurrency crowd sales from their respective platforms.\nAlthough it may be a bit late, Microsoft’s Bing platform has joined the ranks of those banning cryptocurrency advertisements, announcing that they would do the same just the other day.\nIn direct contradiction of Twitter’s ban of ICO advertisements, Dorsey’s other venture, Square, has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies, launching Bitcoin trading on one of its apps in January.\nThe launch of Bitcoin trading on their Cash platform was the first move which Square made into the cryptocurrency space. As of yet, Square has yet to accept cryptocurrencies as a way in which consumers can pay merchants for products, who have traditionally used high-fee credit cards.\nBut it seems that Square does have plans to accept a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in the future, as Dorsey noted:\nIf we were able to use it (Bitcoin) as a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.\nThe possibility of an addition of cryptocurrencies to the Square platform may be promising for the industry as Square has been growing faster than Paypal’s subsidiary, Venmo, another upcoming payment processing platform.\nThe aforementioned addition of cryptocurrency trading to Square’s Cash platform was an unbridled success, as millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were quickly sold on the platform. At the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2018, Square reported that they had sold $34.1 million worth of Bitcoin in their first quarter, spending $33.9 million to acquire the same Bitcoin.\nDespite the success of the arrival of cryptocurrency trading on Square, it was still a controversial topic within the internal structure of the company. In Dorsey’s speech at Consensus, he mentioned, “We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology.” He even mentioned how the debate over the addition of cryptocurrencies was prevalent “all the way at the board level.”\nEven with the presence of “healthy discussion” about cryptos at Square, with Jack Dorsey at the helm, it can be assured that Square will continue to make moves to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhat do you think of Jack Dorsey’s statements? Do you like them, hate them, or are indifferent? What moves do you think Twitter and Square should make to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies and related technologies? We would love to know what you have to say, so let us know in the comments below.\nImages Courtesy of Twitter/@CNBC, Reuters, howldb.com, Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tech giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:40:27.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76a57737dbfe2063ee42585bc03791cf64ab0f28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfclrIspyEQ.w.2ZrQhDgJPbARXJkuhUvLW5aOiapNCiL9YHlBJ8tJpOhwRYdN_O6ohWCdt3otrLA.EizTx_x..qqZDqO6iRYNJ848FPQpJ6LJEoHkGoGhBcqZMgbnz19wvtF_m5MQrYZm9uT0DLWy8XLzs_5JuzlM-", "site_full": "cryptowirelive.com", "site": "cryptowirelive.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Mining to Use 0.5% of World’s Energy by End of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows - Crypto Wire Live", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining to Use 0.5% of World’s Energy by End of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows - Crypto Wire Live", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xOTAwNmI1ZmUxODQwZjEyNWYzOWE1MGVlM2ViNWJjZC5qcGc=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76a57737dbfe2063ee42585bc03791cf64ab0f28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfclrIspyEQ.w.2ZrQhDgJPbARXJkuhUvLW5aOiapNCiL9YHlBJ8tJpOhwRYdN_O6ohWCdt3otrLA.EizTx_x..qqZDqO6iRYNJ848FPQpJ6LJEoHkGoGhBcqZMgbnz19wvtF_m5MQrYZm9uT0DLWy8XLzs_5JuzlM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining to Use 0.5% of World’s Energy by End of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows - Crypto Wire Live", "text": "By admin Posted on 37 mins ago\nEconomist Alex de Vries calculates the amount of energy used by specific Bitcoin miners in their lifetime, concluding that their energy use is a “big problem”. Economist Alex de Vries, who published an article on “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” yesterday, May 16, in scientific journal Joule , told the Independent that Bitcoin (BTC) mining will use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by 2018.\nDe Vries concludes that as the BTC network currently consumes about 2.55 GW of electricity and moves towards consuming 7.67 GW in the future (for reference, Ireland consumes 3.1 GW and Austria 8.2 GW), the network “has a big problem, and it is growing fast.” However, he does note that solutions like the Lightning Network “may alleviate the situation.” Bitcoin mining requires energy for performing the calculations – hashes – that give miners Bitcoin rewards. In mid-February, it was reported that crypto mining in the country of Iceland would consume more energy than households in 2018. The debate over whether Bitcoin mining is overly harmful for the environment is seen by some as a non-issue, due to the real need for Bitcoin in underbanked countries.\nDe Vries told the Independent, however, that “half a percent is already quite shocking:”\n“It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.” The scientific study goes into detail about the different types of Bitcoin miners and their individual energy usage, noting that “trying to measure the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date.” De Vries uses Bitmain’s Antminers as his main example to show how much energy each machine uses in its lifetime. As De Vries’s study is the first time data on Bitcoin energy consumption has been peer-reviewed, he hopes his paper will “get the conversation started,” as he believes that the world needs “more scientific discussion on where this network is headed” as opposed to “back-of-the-envelope calculations,” he told the Independent.\nConversely, the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain , is being used to alleviate environmental impact in some cases. This week, IBM announced a partnership with Veridium Labs with the aim of tokenizing carbon credits to allow companies to better track their carbon footprint through blockchain, potentially allowing them to reduce their carbon impact.

The software advancement makes blocks big enough to process lots of transactions over time — which gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit. Unfortunately, many misdirected individuals assume the BCH chain will start processing 32MB blocks right away, which could lead to a blockchain chain that’s much larger in gigabyte size and takes longer to download. However, this is not the case right now at all, because BCH miners process blocks that are often still under 1MB, as the 32MB code is only set to ensure the network is capable in the future.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features The Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption\nAfter the Bitcoin Cash network upgraded yesterday and even before the fork, a few misguided individuals asked why there was a need to raise the block size fourfold when 8MB blocks were not filling just yet. The reason developers raised the limit to 32MB is likely because the software is perfectly capable of handling such a task in the future. Right now block size limits are set by the miner, and developers are there to help set the capacity so blocks cannot get full in the immediate future, and fees will remain low for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network, Core developers let the block size fill beyond capacity, and fees became unreliable during the last quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block size adjustment ensures this will not happen to the BCH network down the road, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as 2017’s last quarter. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community and developers are not afraid of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th upgrade is the second successful hard fork on the BCH network.\nLooking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a website which records BCH chain data currently shows that mining limits are being set by the mining pool. Over the past nine months, there have been a few 2,4, and 8MB blocks processed, but typically blocks have been a megabyte or less. So in essence, once miners decide its necessary to increase the block sizes they process, they will do so based on transactions and adoption increasing over time. In fact, current data also shows the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is still 34.4GB larger than the Bitcoin Cash chain. After the block size increase miners are not processing 32MB blocks, the upgrade was meant to ensure they can handle that capacity in the future. Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by 186% in Nine Months\nAt the moment Bitcoin Cash transactions per day are less than BTC as there are roughly 20-25,000 daily BCH transactions. But there’s also been a misdirected notion that the BCH chain isn’t getting much use, but this is simply untrue as data shows over the past nine months that BCH daily transaction percentage rates have increased . The decentralized currency BCH has seen a steady incline (186%) of use since the August 1 fork and the expansion of BCH transactions are now only 5-10,000 transactions less per day than the Litecoin (LTC) network — a cryptocurrency that has been around for 7 years. This is due in part to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms like the tipping bot Tippr , the social media apps Memo and Blockpress , and other applications that help increase BCH usage. In just nine months Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled its transaction count, and the BCH daily transaction rate is just below LTC’s daily transactions per day. 32X the Capacity is Merely Preparation for the Future of Bitcoin Cash Adoption\nEssentially the bottom line is the software is now capable of processing 32MB blocks as it was previously capable of 8MB blocks. So far BCH miners had proven the capability of mining much larger blocks than 1MB multiple times, clearing thousands of transactions from the mempool. After the successful fork on May 15, some BCH supporters are already asking developers to remove the block size limit entirely. The hilarious TX Highway has updated to 32 lanes.\nMoreover, we know from testing that the Bitcoin software is capable of processing gigabyte blocks, and research studies further suggest the network could handle terabyte blocks as well. Unlike other digital asset developers, BCH programmers have set the bar high for capacity based on the known advancements in scaling a cryptocurrency network. Instead of saying “we don’t need to scale now,” the 32MB increase establishes a base block size that can efficiently handle 32X more transactions than the BTC network’s highest daily transaction rate recorded this past December.\nWhat do you think about the 32MB block size upgrade? Do you think that the developers should remove the capacity limit entirely? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nImages via Pixabay, TX Highway, Bitinfocharts.com, and Coin Dance.\nDo you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread?

Price has quite a way to go before testing the neckline at $8,800. An upside break could lead to an uptrend of the same height as the double bottom formation.\nBitcoin price formed a double bottom pattern on its 1-hour time frame and needs to break past the neckline to confirm the climb.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the downtrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 200 SMA lines up with the pattern’s neckline to add to its strength as a ceiling. If it holds, another bottom could be formed.\nRSI is on the move up to indicate that buyers have enough energy to push for more gains, but the oscillator is also nearing overbought levels to reflect exhaustion. Stochastic is also heading north but could be due to turn back down form overbought levels soon, so bitcoin price might follow suit. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nInvestors continue to hold out for positive updates in the industry but until those come out, caution has prevailed after bitcoin price was rejected at one resistance level after another. Traders are also keeping close tabs on the investigation into South Korea’s largest crypto exchange as this revives issues on regulation and security.\nIn contrast, the dollar has been firmly supported by stronger rate hike hopes, particularly for the Fed meeting in June. Although some data points have fallen short of estimates, traders are paying closer attention to positive figures on inflation and shrugging off downbeat remarks from FOMC members.\nLooking ahead, it could be all about market sentiment from here as a week without industry developments could draw more sellers in.

The current market value of the bitcoins is more than $140 million, according to the CoinMarketCap price index, which values one bitcoin at around $8,800 . The sale of such a large amount of bitcoins could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency markets. The Tokyo-based Mt Gox went out of business in 2014 after losing around 1 million of its customers bitcoins. At the time, the lost bitcoins were worth around $387 million but the price of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has since risen considerably. The moving of the funds, first spotted by The Next Web, is the first time in over three months that the former exchange has moved any of its assets. Mt Gox has previously offloaded around $500 million worth of bitcoin , with each sale usually being reflected by severe drops in cryptocurrency markets. “It appears that the Mt Gox trust… NYSE Isn’t Planning a Bitcoin Futures Market, But a Proper Crypto Exchange According to a report by the New York Times, the world’s biggest stock exchange New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is planning to operate a proper cryptocurrency trading platform.

Bitcoin fell on Thursday.\nInvesting.com - Cryptocurrencies were lower on Thursday, with Bitcoin nearing a six-day low as it struggled to gain traction. Bitcoin was trading at of $8,282.10, falling 0.87% as of 8:55 AM ET (12:55 GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange. Other digital coins fell, with Ethereum , the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, inching down 0.95% to $697.23 on the Bitfinex exchange. Ripple , the third largest virtual currency, decreased 0.39% to $0.68937 while Litecoin was at $137.96, a decrease of 0.90%. On the regulation front, the Organization of Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) is looking into cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), to help government bodies develop legislation to protect consumer rights. While the OECD recognizes virtual currencies as a means of payment, the discussions will mostly be held to ensure the financial safety of consumers, according to Elina Sidorenko, head of Russia’s cryptocurrency risk department. Elsewhere, PayPal CFO John Rainey told CNBC that the payments firm doesn’t have any interest in cryptocurrencies due to its volatility, which could threaten the livelihood of merchants. “Right now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it's something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that,” he said. Meanwhile, Iran’s central bank is working towards using digital coins in international trade as a way to circumvent the use of the American dollar. With pending U.S. sanctions against the country, Iran is looking for ways around using the international banking payment system, known as SWIFT.
