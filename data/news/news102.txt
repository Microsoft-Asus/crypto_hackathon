Photo / Getty news.com.au Share on Reddit reddit A hospital in the UK has begun offering treatment for bitcoin addicts as the cryptocurrency craze fuels a new breed of gambling addicts. Castle Craig Hospital in Scotland has launched a programme aimed specifically at people who are hooked on trading digital currencies like bitcoin. The hospital specialises in treating addictions and had been asked to help people with cryptocurrency problems. It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction. Dr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were \"a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction\". Advertisement Share on Reddit reddit Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity. \"It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it's mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.\" And that's where the havoc begins. \"People dive in because they don't want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.\" In that regard, it wasn't surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze. \"I think it's an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That's what a compulsive gambler wants.\" Related articles: 5 minutes to read There were parallels with pokie machines, and Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead. \"It provides excitement and an escape from reality... It's a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.\" It was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular. \"It's relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don't know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it's relatively easy.\" Bitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made. There are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system. \"A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don't want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.\" The situation \"just goes bad\" from there. The patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide. \"They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don't realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.\" Bitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late. \"Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.\" The moment of realisation was depressingly familiar. \"It's usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.\" Castle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/bitcoin-craze-fuels-new-breed-of-gambling-addicts/news-story/7b20ef68e16e3c260417e8a724cc9cab"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nottingham trent university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:36:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "689889c4056c963ca7d7f7f237dd022ea83f918b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGtVJNDnzFvbvj.hs5CmjwEHk7mwEwFtl8Tlm8qHLKjjxkQZOFEkAERUwfoDaQewFfnyj_FCu8mrLhj13sPJX7pk-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Debunked: \"Off-chain transactions such as those happening on the Lightning Network ARE Bitcoin transactions\"", "title_full": "Debunked: \"Off-chain transactions such as those happening on the Lightning Network ARE Bitcoin transactions\" : btc", "published": "2018-05-29T20:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "689889c4056c963ca7d7f7f237dd022ea83f918b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGtVJNDnzFvbvj.hs5CmjwEHk7mwEwFtl8Tlm8qHLKjjxkQZOFEkAERUwfoDaQewFfnyj_FCu8mrLhj13sPJX7pk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fruitsofknowledge", "published": "2018-05-29T20:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Debunked: \"Off-chain transactions such as those happening on the Lightning Network ARE Bitcoin transactions\"", "text": "While off-chain solutions have to utilize Bitcoin transactions in order to work at all, transacting through them is not the same as transacting on the Bitcoin Network.\nA clear example of why is that Peer-to-obligatory-off-chain-channel-dependence-to-Peer is not truly peer to peer.

Then we are essentially reverting back to using a central mint or Chaumian system dispersed over a few slightly more anonymous actors, minus the inflation risk.\nThe new \"mint\" can still break in parts, be hindered or taken out.

At its core, blockchain is a database that can continuously add on new information.\nIts allure though, lies in its decentralization. Rather than keeping this record with one party, the blockchain is a record, updating in real time, kept often by several parties. In doing so, the database becomes effectively unchangeable, and can also cut out the middle man in some applications.\nStill, the founder, Weixing Chen, was sparse on details, according to China Money Network . Chen, who is working with Yang Jun, co-founder of Meituan, did not offer timing, or additional details on the project.\nChen and Jun aren’t the first to see a place for blockchain in the ride-hailing space. A Singapore-based startup dubbed MVLchain launched a blockchain-based ride-hailing app in April , effectively claiming to cut out the middleman. So while Uber has come under fire for taking about 25% of drivers’ fares , MVLchain claims to take a smaller cut, dedicated to maintaining the app. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2018/05/28/kuaidi-founder-weixing-chen-to-launch-blockchain-based-ride-hailing-app-in-china", "https://medium.com/@mvlchain/the-mvl-app-introducing-sgs-1st-decentralized-ride-hailing-app-100e29dae67a"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kuaidi dache", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "zhang peng lightrocket", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "didi chuxing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weixing chen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda shen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weixi cheng", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T20:17:48.074+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40aa2e19eb467fd1511935fd21955fb9f61d5c16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVQW_g.NPkmLmfQQRKtfCMS2E4JoSRwA1dqKT3jVhY3cZjREWZjfqnacAOMH6iw__F9nd45YImqJAePrYtE3yk2_6k6gYekknB7fA5_NzjTyZmidIgn_TEhB3.xuAKdk8IA--", "site_full": "22ticks.com", "site": "22ticks.com", "site_section": "https://22ticks.com/feed", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "22TICKS LIFESTYLE BLOG", "title": "TRON TRX AND BITCOIN BTC READY TO MOON?

All five SEC Commissioners are coming to Atlanta to meet with you: young people, the military, urban and rural, those saving for retirement, and seniors—the diverse, the dynamic people of the southeast region.”\nAll five SEC commissioners will be in attendance including Chairman Jay Clayton, who had a speech earlier this year about cryptocurrencies and ICOs at Princeton University on April 5. When asked if he thought ICOs were inherently fraudulent Clayton said “absolutely not”, stating that his hope was the regulation introduced by the SEC would have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency space by stamping out bad actors and allowing legitimate projects to thrive.\nMany members of the cryptocurrency community have been concerned recently that the SEC is gearing up to classify cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as securities, meaning that the tokens represented an underlying asset as opposed to being utility tokens. The security classification would have disastrous effects on the market with strict regulations on taxes and even who can or cannot legally own and invest in crypto.\nHowever, Clayton set some minds at ease by saying it was ICO tokens that the SEC were really looking at, not Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the Ethereum co-founder has stated that he is “ extremely comfortable ” that Ethereum does not qualify as a security.\nThe confusion over how to classify crypto-tokens and on the processes involved in ICO investment, in general, are the reason discussions like the one being held in June are necessary, and the SEC Bitcoin and ICO session may help to clarify the government’s stance on some of the pressing legal issues being widely discussed in the cryptocurrency community.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://www.sec.gov/investing-america"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec investor conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:43:07.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91a02cf63813238b67da3cc5e6492768496ec5aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.IDPt93LmNbuf0aiJYrra.07eT6vDdUph28yyVg5KVrbblxjc14n1caMtP5kzYohDv4C_dGlZ2I1g-", "site_full": "www.openpr.com", "site": "openpr.com", "site_section": "http://www.openpr.com/rss/category/1/IT-New-Media-Software.xml?SID=c0171834c61b9a7be8433b799798e4dd", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "openPR.com - New Public Relations: IT, New Media & Software", "title": "Bitcoin Electricity Consumption – Part 2", "title_full": "Bitcoin Electricity Consumption – Part 2", "published": "2018-05-29T20:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43086, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91a02cf63813238b67da3cc5e6492768496ec5aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.IDPt93LmNbuf0aiJYrra.07eT6vDdUph28yyVg5KVrbblxjc14n1caMtP5kzYohDv4C_dGlZ2I1g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Smarter Business", "published": "2018-05-29T20:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Electricity Consumption – Part 2", "text": "Press release from: Smarter Business The debate rages on as bitcoin electricity consumption increases… Earlier this year, we published an article on bitcoin electricity consumption, reporting how Iceland has become one of the top locations for cryptocurrency servers, which now exceed the consumption of private energy users.Now, the criticism amongst ecological circles and the debates around bitcoin electricity consumption have been fuelled by a paper by Alex de Vries of PwC’s Experience Center in Amsterdam.His paper, Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem, concludes that bitcoin’s electricity consumption could soon be heading above a consumption rate of 8 gigawatts (GW) per year.The paper’s findings:At the moment, the bitcoin network consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity – as high as the annual energy consumption of Ireland. This could reach a consumption of 7.67 GW in the future – close to the energy consumption of the entire nation of Austria (8.2 GW). By the end of 2018, the mining of bitcoin could be using as much as 0.005% of the entire world’s energy use. The reality is that bitcoin uses a massive amount of energy. Author Alex de Vries says: “The bitcoin development community is experimenting with solutions such as the Lightning Network to improve the throughput of the network, which may alleviate the situation. For now, however, bitcoin has a big problem and it is growing fast.”Why does bitcoin mining require so much energy? The bitcoin mining process uses computers with software that can solve complex mathematical problems. A new block is added to the blockchain every time a new problem is solved, rewarding the miner with bitcoins. This process requires a lot of energy because the computers need to ledger all the transactions so that the same coins aren’t spent twice – this takes time and consumes a lot of electricity.How can bitcoin electricity consumption become sustainable? De Vries’ research reveals that if the price of bitcoin continues to go down, and the amount of energy needed to mine it continues to rise, bitcoin investment could become inefficient.One of the ways this can be avoided is if the world shifts to 100% renewable energy in the years ahead. With renewables, the environmental and efficiency concerns around bitcoin energy usage would be negated.But is it possible to go 100% green?New research from Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews journal found that a shift to total renewable energy using contemporary technology is both possible and affordable.Co-author of the research, Brian Vad Mathiesen of Aalborg University says: “There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible. Our contribution deals with these myths one-by-one, using all the latest research. Now let’s get back to the business of modelling low-cost scenarios to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system, so we can tackle the climate and health challenges they pose.”If we were to eliminate fossil fuel usage, this would eliminate the environmental and efficiency challenges caused by energy-intensive bitcoin mining.It’s not impossible to imagine a world in which bitcoin is used exclusively, backed by green energy. If there’s one thing we’ve learnt over time, it’s to ‘never say never’…Smarter Business is one of the UK’s leading independent consultancies, helping businesses secure the most comprehensive savings solutions from utilities contract management and procurement to business loans and facilities maintenance. smarterbusiness.co.uk/ John De Mierre House", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smarterbusiness.co.uk/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pwc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:17:23.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "039edd894e2afe20e22aa66e5998610b711da836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4u_1mO3PFHbP3l2mqkx_qtCBx7_6UNplOUsetYMaAceiDZ.A.gs6O5wp3Z1heOgIkH_yBJZPIlg--", "site_full": "forums.brianenos.com", "site": "brianenos.com", "site_section": "https://forums.brianenos.com/forum/20-miscellaneous-topics-that-do-not-fit-in-any-other-forum/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Miscellaneous Topics That Do Not Fit in Any Other Forum - Brian Enos's Forums...

What the macro and fixed income expert isn’t sure of is whether such price manipulations are against the law. The DOJ recently began investigating suspected trading malpractices in the cryptocurrency market. Whales and Miners Influence Bitcoin Prices\nWriting in an op-ed for Forbes , macroeconomist Pter Tchir states that he’d be surprised if there weren’t any shenanigans going on with the way Bitcoin prices move, saying: Whether the activities meet the legal definition of manipulation or can lead to a criminal indictment remains to be seen, but I’d be shocked if there wasn’t manipulation of prices occurring. Never forget Rule number two of the Three Rules of Bitcoin –‘There are no rules!’\nAccording to Tchir, whales and miners have vested interests in higher Bitcoin prices. For miners, it makes sense for them to want to push prices higher from an economic perspective. Otherwise, mining no longer becomes a profitable enterprise .\nTchir drew comparisons with the mainstream market arguing that wealth concentration gives whales “the incentive to push prices higher.”\nThere is, however, a significant aspect missing from Tchir’s analysis as it ignores the incentives for price declines. Whales can take advantage of these selloffs by shorting bitcoin and strengthen their monopoly of the market. They can acquire more bitcoins at lower prices before driving prices higher again.\nOn May 24, reports emerged that the DOJ and the CFTC were looking to probe suspected bitcoin price manipulation . According to inside sources, spoofing and wash trading are the focus of the investigation. The DOJ believes traders are engaging in illicit trading activities to move crypto prices in their desired direction. Continuous Crypto Price Decline\nTchir is correct in pointing out that the lack of regulations in the market make it possible for such alleged manipulations to occur. Bitcoin is currently experiencing a week-long decline that seen the number one crypto bouncing of support at $7,000 USD.\nAccording to Tchir, the crypto market is losing steam due to an amalgam of problems that have slowed down adoption rate. He also pointed out that the failure of the market to rally after Consensus has taken some of the bullish hype away from the industry.\nThus, as investigations probe suspected price manipulation, Tchir believes that crypto investor confidence is at an all-time low.\nDo you think that there is a manipulation of bitcoin prices?

IOTA Price Leads Large-Cap Index\nIOTA had entered the day on a slight downslope, eventually declining as far as $1.33 during intraday trading. However, the IOTA price turned a corner at approximately 3:00 UTC and began a sustained rally that carried the token as high as $1.65 shortly before 18:00.\nAt present, IOTA is trading at just under $1.61, which translates into a $4.5 billion market cap. That move equates to a single-day increase of 15 percent, which was best among cryptocurrencies ranked in the top 10 by market cap. IOTA Price Chart\nNearly one-third of all IOTA volume is concentrated on Bitfinex, and the token also features prominently on Binance and OKEx. Notably, the largest IOTA/KRW pair accounts for just eight percent of the token’s overall volume, preventing the “Kimchi premium” from having much effect on IOTA’s global average price. Source: CoinMarketCap Mobile Trinity Wallet Receives Beta Release\nTuesday’s IOTA price rally occurred as part of a much wider market recovery — one that saw the bitcoin price creep back above $7,400 after briefly flirting with its $7,000 support level. Altogether, the cryptocurrency market cap added $15 billion over its previous day mark, and just six of the top 100 coins failed to advance against the US dollar.\nNevertheless, the IOTA token outpaced its peers, likely due to excitement over the beta release of Trinity, the project’s new wallet client. The wallet, which is currently available on Android and iOS (desktop version to follow), is designed to provide users — particularly ones who are less tech-savvy — with a more intuitive and full-featured experience than was previously available.\nIt was the second major development for the project in the past week. As CCN reported, IOTA also inked a deal with UNOPS — a technical advisory wing of the United Nations — to improve the transparency and efficiency of the agency’s internal operations.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "iota price rallies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T00:36:39.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c78ee33375b2c2a7051d2cf9fcc6a54f0cb7681", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXHbFXhOppuRkF9INJV8Bkc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Do We Need To Change Bitcoin Logo ₿?", "title_full": "Do We Need To Change Bitcoin Logo ₿?", "published": "2018-05-29T19:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c78ee33375b2c2a7051d2cf9fcc6a54f0cb7681", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXHbFXhOppuRkF9INJV8Bkc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Logo-coin", "published": "2018-05-29T19:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Do We Need To Change Bitcoin Logo ₿?", "text": "Bitcoin can change our future, our way of consuming, voting, sharing, working...\nBut its logo is attached to symbols of the past.

We turned on the Roku-looking machine in our San Francisco offices and allowed it to do its job. A small fortune was soon amassed, now worth around $100,000. Then, we lost the money. Forever.\nHere’s what happened to WIRED’s 13 Bitcoins—and to the millions of others that have faced the same fate. Stefan Antonowicz, WIRED’s then-head of engineering, set up the miner. Robert McMillan, a former senior writer for WIRED (who now works at The Wall Street Journal ), then wrote about it. “When we received that Butterfly miner, we had a new ethical question: What do you do with the proceeds of a review device that essentially prints money?” says McMillan. First, it’s probably worth explaining how WIRED accrued its six-figure Bitcoin fortune. While fiat currencies, like the dollar, rely on banks and government regulators, Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network monitored by an army of volunteer miners that run specialized software. Every 10 minutes, all the miners in the network race to solve a series of complex cryptographic math problems. The computers that win are awarded a slice of 12.5 new bitcoins. (That number halves every four years; it was 25 when we got our miner.) Usually, the fastest computers in the network solve the problems first. Over time, the puzzles have gotten harder, leading to a kind of computing-power arms race. Back when Bitcoin first launched, it was possible to mine coins using an everyday computer. These days, you’ll need specialized hardware significantly more powerful than the Butterfly Labs miner WIRED had. Currently, there are about 17 million bitcoins in existence ; by 2020, all 21 million planned Bitcoins will have been mined. You can learn more about the process in our Guide to Bitcoin .) WIRED’s miner essentially won the Bitcoin math lottery a couple of times, allowing it to generate a little over 13 coins into the network. Then, the staff had to figure out what to do with them. “We had a very long conversation, over several weeks, about what to do with the money,” says Michael Calore, a senior editor at WIRED who has been at the magazine since 2006. Some staff members argued the Bitcoin should be donated, or set aside for a charitable purpose in the future. Others said it had to be destroyed permanently. What was agreed upon was that the money shouldn’t just sit there, because it could influence how the magazine reported on cryptocurrencies. “I said we had to dump it and donate the money to charity soonest or we wouldn’t be able to cover Bitcoin,” says Adam Rogers, a deputy editor at WIRED. “We had to disclose it in every story.” Eventually, it was decided that the private key, which unlocks the Bitcoin wallet and allows the funds to be spent, should be destroyed. “We talked about donating it to a journalism institution, or setting it aside as a scholarship. But we decided that if we gained any benefit from it at all, it would color our future coverage of bitcoin,” says Calore. “So we just destroyed the key, knowing full well that it could eventually be worth six or seven figures.” McMillan then posted a story announcing the key had been ripped to pieces. Throwing Away the Key To deal in bitcoin, you need at least two different keys, one public and one private (newer security protocols allow you to add more private keys). Together, the combination of codes lets you trade Bitcoin without an intermediary like a bank. You can look up WIRED’s public key to send us money, and then in theory, we could use our private key to access those funds—had we not destroyed it. It’s extremely unlikely we could successfully guess the code: it’s 64 digits long and no one remembers what it was. No additional copies of the private key exist, at least according to the people who were there. “I didn’t make a copy of the paper, or commit the 64 characters on it to memory,” says Antonowicz, the technologist who set up the miner. The good news is that if someone did move the coins, the transaction would be public, allowing WIRED to see where they traveled to. In fact, you too can check out WIRED’s lost Bitcoins right here . In theory, we might be able to recover the Bitcoin wallet from the hard drive where it was stored, but even that wouldn’t be much help. “There might have been a way to forensically recover the wallet—with the encrypted key—from my hard drive, but I shredded that particular drive years ago,” says Antonowicz. Plus, even if the wallet was resurrected, it’s encrypted. Breaking that protection via brute force would take an unimaginable amount of time. There are three times more possible combinations than there are atoms in the observable universe, by Antonowicz’s count. “Originally I was going to say that the closest metaphor I have is that we dropped a car key somewhere in the Atlantic, but I think it’s closer for me to say we dropped the key somewhere between here and the Alpha Centauri,” says Antonowicz. Recovering our bitcoins is essentially like trying to recover a photo album on a lost computer. Except not only did you get rid of the hard drive, you also protected the album in an encrypted folder with a 64-digit passcode that you threw away. Still, we wanted to make sure there was absolutely no way to get the bitcoins back. WIRED’s editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, suggested that if we were able to recover the funds, they might go toward hiring a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. I reached out to the founder of Butterfly Labs, who didn’t respond. I also contacted Mark Frauenfelder, a writer and the author of a WIRED article about how he recovered $30,000 worth of Bitcoin. He agrees we’re screwed. “If you lost your private keys I think it’s game over,” he says. I also looked into a service that tries to crack cryptocurrency wallets via sheer brute force. But their services would be no help, since we don’t have access to the hard drive itself. It looks like WIRED really did lose the money forever. The good news is we’re far from alone. Lost and Never Found Chainalysis, a research firm that analyzes activity across different cryptocurrency markets, estimates that between 2.78 and 3.79 million, or between 17 and 23 percent of all bitcoins have been lost. That includes wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of Bitcoin who hasn’t touched his estimated 1 million coins since 2011. “The number of lost coins over time will drop,” says Michael Gronager, the CEO and co-founder of Chainalysis. He argues that it’s because there’s more awareness of Bitcoin’s enduring value, even if the price wildly fluctuates. He also says that even if Satoshi were to reemerge, his activity wouldn’t significantly impact the market because he wouldn’t likely spend a large sum of Bitcoin at once. There are several ways you can lose Bitcoin. Like WIRED, you can simply lose track of your private key or your hard drive. One of the most famous cases of this is what happened to James Howells, an IT worker in London who lost 7,500 bitcoins, or around $56 million, when his laptop was thrown away in 2013. He reportedly wants to dig through five years of trash to unearth the computer. This is the most common way to lose Bitcoin; even Elon Must tweeted that he forgot how to access a portion of a coin. You can also lose bitcoins by running buggy code or making software mistakes, though these instances are more rare. Last year, for example, someone forgot to collect their mining reward and burned 12.5 coins. In another similar incident , someone may have accidentally swapped a processing fee with the value of the transaction, resulting in nearly 300 coins lost. One time, someone even sent 2,600 coins to an incorrectly configured address , burning them into nonexistence. All of these examples come from BlockSci , a tool developed at Princeton University for analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain. It can be difficult to assess whether any given bitcoin is really lost for good. “It’s actually pretty difficult to say for certain. A lot of what we do is look at the big picture,” says Harry Kalodner a PhD at Princeton who helped develop BlockSci. He says part of the problem is that you can rarely determine whether someone is just holding onto their Bitcoin, or whether they’ve definitively lost access to it. Since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any single authority, there’s no one who can simply close your account. So what could WIRED have done, were we to do the whole thing again? Since 2013, Bitcoin has added a number of new, more sophisticated features. For one, we could have locked our coins away until a certain date. “One Bitcoin feature that’s been added is that it now supports time-locked coins, that makes them completely un-spendable until a set point in the future,” says Kalodner. Like, say, May 2018, when the editor-in-chief could really use some money to hire another reporter. More Great WIRED Stories *Losing Bitcoin is shockingly easy.

This is the case of buying the virtual currency of PeteCwin in early 2018, which doubled its price during a record period, which caused a big bang in the financial markets and prompted many experts to try to understand the reasons for this rocket rise, and encouraged a large number of investors to seize the opportunity and record profits Imaginary, no other investment can be achieved. Simply put, Petcuen is a virtual encrypted currency, designed and launched by an anonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Pitcullin is similar in nature to the dollar, euro and other currencies, but different in that it is fake and is used only over the Internet, no physical presence, it is encrypted and can not track the buying and selling processes that are used. One of the main advantages of the \"Betcuen\" secret, as can not track sales and purchase or control or intervention in the absence of any serial number associated with it, which enhances privacy and limits the control of governments and banks on the currency. For example, when you buy a commodity in the currency of your home, the value of the commodity goes from one user account to another immediately without any transfer fees or through any bank or intermediary. KFH is not associated with a specific country or geographic location and can be used in any country just like the local currency. Many companies in some countries have begun to allow this virtual currency. One of the advantages of this currency is its scarcity, with its inventor planning to produce only 21 million units by 2040, which helps preserve its value and prevents it from collapsing. It is also designed to prevent any transaction or action, and is issued collectively across the network.

Rehab Center to Treat Bitcoin Addicts 17:06 Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit (AFP/ File Photo) A rehab facility in Scotland is offering a course for Bitcoin addicts in a bid to treat people obsessed with the virtual money. Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, will treat crypto-addicts alongside alcoholics, drug users and people battling other serious addictions. According to experts, cryptocurrency trading addicts show the same kind of behavioural addictions as online gamblers. The West Linton facility said it now treats cryptocurrency addiction by using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes. Castle Craig said there are no figures for the number of people addicted to cryptocurrency, but there are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system. Bitcoin is the most recognisable name in the field of cryptocurrency, and has been in existence since 2010. When it first launched, it was worth around $0.39 (£0.30), and reached a peak price late last year of almost $18,000 (£13,500). Chris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, said: 'The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. 'It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.' Some treatments at the centre will be led by Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict. He said introducing a life structure is key for addicts. 'Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem,' therapist Mr Marini said.

Now the task is to find companies to invest in the property and create jobs. Some have already expressed interest, including cryptocurrency mining firms. A federal trust has been overseeing cleanup of the General Motors Superfund site since 2011 at a cost of $130 million. The site, which sits on the banks of the St. Lawrence River and close to the bridge to Canada, is now being marketed to potential manufacturers. Photo: RACER Trust\nAbout halfway through the cleanup, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the site was far more polluted than originally thought. General Motors had left its 217-acre property in Massena laced with extremely toxic PCBs. PCB oil was used as a coolant until it was banned in the late 1970s. This is what the General Motors property looked like from the air shortly after it closed in 2008, laying off 500 people. RACER Trust has overseen demolition that's included razing GM's former buildings, an iconic water tower, and half a million tons of PCB contaminated sediment. Photo: RACER Trust\nThe EPA removed half a million tons of contaminated materials. The project has taken years. \"We are down to the last active remediation,\" says Bruce Rasher, redevelopment manager for RACER trust , the federal entity that took over all of GM's abandoned properties when the automaker went bankrupt during the recession. Breathing new life into a polluted industrial site\nRACER’s task was to clean-up the site and find new buyers, environmental and economic goals. Last March, RACER issued a call for offers to buy the property. Rasher says they got some hits. \"I can say that we have received several credible offers, so we are pleased so far with the offers received.\"\nRasher says he can’t disclose how many offers or from which companies. But he can say some are from data centers, from cryptocurrency miners , and from firms that specialize in the technology virtual currencies are based on, called blockchain . Another photo of the GM site in Massena as the cleanup nears completion. RACER Trust is continuing to receive offers to buy parts of the property. Photo: RACER Trust It'll likely take more than one buyer\nThe GM plant was huge. Rasher says it’s unlikely a manufacturer of that size would come in. \"RACER will not sell to any buyer any more of the property than that buyer can productively use,\" he says.\nRasher says the land is likely to be subdivided for multiple buyers. So the trust is putting out another call for offers. Rasher says it’s casting a wide net, to U.S., Canadian, and other foreign companies willing to invest money and create jobs in Massena.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Scottish Borders by 0\nBy Press Association and Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline A rehab facility in Scotland is offering a course for Bitcoin addicts in a bid to treat people obsessed with the virtual money. Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, will treat crypto-addicts alongside alcoholics, drug users and people battling other serious addictions. According to experts, cryptocurrency trading addicts show the same kind of behavioural addictions as online gamblers. Castle Craig Hospital (pictured) in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, is offering a course for cryptocurrency addicts in a bid to treat people obsessed with the virtual money The West Linton facility said it now treats cryptocurrency addiction by using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes.\nCastle Craig said there are no figures for the number of people addicted to cryptocurrency, but there are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system. Bitcoin is the most recognisable name in the field of cryptocurrency, and has been in existence since 2010. When it first launched, it was worth around $0.39 (£0.30), and reached a peak price late last year of almost $18,000 (£13,500).\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, said: ‘The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. ‘It provides excitement and an escape from reality.\nBitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.’ The West Linton facility said it now treats cryptocurrency addiction by using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system, with Bitcoin (pictured) being the most common Some treatments at the centre will be led by Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict. He said introducing a life structure is key for addicts.

market and supply is limited (due to the block weight/size limit), the price will be whatever people are willing to pay . Those who pay less than the market rate will see their transactions slowed down or ignored; those who pay more will see them processed quickly.\nWhat is not known is whether the resulting fees paid will be sufficient to keep the network secure. As security against chain rewriting is proportional to the cost spent by miners, we can expect that it is also proportional to how much miners are paid. If people are not willing to pay high fees at all, the security may collapse in a tragedy of the commons. If people do, and the value secured by the network is high, fees may grow very high as well.\nWhat Bitcoin (the blockchain) technology offers you is an independent currency, beyond control of banks or nations, which permits you to autonomously audit the entire system. While you don't have to, it permits you to be your own bank and be entirely independent from third parties.\nWhat it does not offer directly is a convenient payment system. Bitcoin transactions are slow, inconvenient, inefficient, and unreliable - and perhaps expensive too. They are pretty much the opposite of what a consumer would want as a payment system.\nHowever , due to being a natively digital currency, without third parties that can deny you access to the system, the hope is that it can be used as a base layer in a financial system upon which actual payment technology can be built (sometimes called \"layer two\"). A very promising proposal that is being actively worked on is Lightning. Lightning offers cheap, reliable, fast payments, on top of the Bitcoin chain. However, not every Lightning payment corresponds to a transaction on-chain. Yet, its security is very similar to the blockchain itself and still does not rely on third parties.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:42:09.049+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2508cb3786f3ede1116fa32b8cbd094f69396a85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TcMIB0mg1.BvvUYPAKFyinqr87sUQYElEe8FUpGue9uz6oexT8J10QQ5ft1kyxXo-", "site_full": "www.gamekyo.com", "site": "gamekyo.com", "site_section": "http://www.gamekyo.com/boards_games.html", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Gamekyo : magazine social des jeux vidéo", "title": "Earn free bitcoin - BTCMINESPOOL.com - I Got My Bitcoin", "title_full": "Gamekyo : Earn free bitcoin - BTCMINESPOOL.com - I Got My Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T18:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53617, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2508cb3786f3ede1116fa32b8cbd094f69396a85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TcMIB0mg1.BvvUYPAKFyinqr87sUQYElEe8FUpGue9uz6oexT8J10QQ5ft1kyxXo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jacobsas", "published": "2018-05-29T18:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoin - BTCMINESPOOL.com - I Got My Bitcoin", "text": "Cloud mining or cloud hashing is an idea, which empowers customers to purchase mining ability of the hardware set in remote server centres.\nWith the rise in prices of Bitcoin, we are able to generate great profits for our investors around the world – guaranteeing anyone a consistent\nflow of income whoever get associated with us.

Bank recently issued guidance regarding its position on the purchase and transfer of cryptocurrencies.\nThe SARB does not regulate the exchange of cryptocurrencies in South Africa, but moving cryptocurrency overseas and buying or selling on a foreign exchange could get you into trouble with exchange control regulations.\nThe only permissible way for South Africans to purchase cryptocurrencies from abroad is to use their single discretionary allowance of R1 million or individual foreign investment allowance of R10 million per year.\nMany South Africans have invested in cryptocurrencies through both local and international exchanges, and many have moved their cryptocurrency “overseas”.\nMyBroadband spoke to Werksmans Director Leon Rood to determine how cryptocurrency owners should proceed in the face of the SARB’s stance on digital currencies.\nGoing forward Rood said South Africans who have transacted with cryptocurrency do not need to do anything to ensure compliance with the SARB regulation.\n“My view is that for residents who have undertaken transactions, no action is strictly required as SARB have made it clear they do not regulate cryptos,” he said.\n“An additional defence would be to state that the transactions will mostly fall under the R1-million annual single discretionary allowance anyway.”\nHowever, Rood advised that going forward, residents who wish to take out large sums should formally declare the use of the R10-million allowance, or be sure that they are within the R1-million limit.\nTransactions below the annual single discretionary R1-million allowance do not require approval, so most South Africans can argue they have abided by the regulations.\n“Moving inter-wallet has no guidance, but I would advise the most risk-free approach would also be to argue it’s under the R1 million,” said Rood.\n“Larger amounts may become too tricky to defend.”\nUncertainty The SARB currently has no formal mechanisms to monitor and report transactions conducted using cryptocurrency, but it can investigate arbitrage conducted between local and international exchanges.\n“The scheme of using the arbitrage is definitely being investigated, there are at least three matters under review currently,” said Rood.\n“This is easier to pick up as actual rand is applied or involved, so detection is easier.”\nRood said that no defined regulation currently applies specifically to cryptocurrency transactions.\n“For the moment, as there is no actual regulation or guidance, one may argue South Africans cannot be said to have contravened anything and for the moment no remedial steps are required.\nThe SARB has also not stated how it will address the distributed nature of the blockchain and how inter-wallet transfers will interact with exchange control.\n“SARB intends launching a proof of concept for blockchain-based interbank clearing and settlement in partnership with New York-based ConsenSys,” said Rood.\n“This project is aimed at understanding the consequences of using distributed ledger technology to transfer value and a public report on the findings is expected to be released during the second quarter of 2018.”\nNow read: SARB defines cryptocurrencies as tokens, not money cryptocurrency Headline Leon Rood regulation SARB south africa Werksmans", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

broker for your trading or investing needs Cryptocurrencies of all types make use of distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. Blockchains act as decentralized systems for recording and documenting transactions that take place involving a particular digital currency.\nPut simply, blockchain is a transaction ledger that maintains identical copies across each member computer within a network. While blockchain is most famous for its role in facilitating the rise of digital currencies over the past several years, there are also many other non-cryptocurrency uses for this technology.\nIndeed, some blockchain proponents believe that the technology could far outpace cryptocurrencies themselves in terms of its overall impact, and that the real potential of blockchain is only just now being discovered. As such, it’s likely that financial advisors and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it’s being utilized in any number of other applications.\nBelow, we’ll explore some of the most exciting and popular use cases likely to bring blockchain further into the world of mainstream business and finance. Traditionally, the transfer of value has been both expensive and slow, according to a report by Deloitte, and especially for payments taking place across international borders.\nOne reason for this is that, when multiple currencies are involved, the transfer process typically requires multiple banks in multiple locations before the intended recipient can actually collect his or her money. There are existing services to help facilitate this process in a faster way, but these tend to by quite expensive.

The conversion between fiat money and Bitcoin is done through the so called P2P trading network – PlutusDEX, which is built on the blockchain of Ethereum.\nOnce a user purchases something with Ether or Bitcoin, they will receive e “loyalty reward” in the form of Plutons, digital tokens which can be used in a variety of ways (cash back, air miles, help with next purchase, etc).\nAccording to BusinessCloud, the founder of the fintech startup, Danial Daychopan, commented on the innovation as “the beginning of day-to-day crypto usage”. This is very true, since users will not have to wait for merchants to accept Bitcoin, but will directly purchase from them through the Plutus Tap and Pay app.\nPlutus is a relatively new project,

https://www.naturalnews.com\n( Natural News ) Are certain malicious entities committing mass fraud in order to manipulate the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? That's what the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently looking into as part of a new criminal probe into crypto crimes.\nThe investigation comes on the heels of complaints by crypto critics that crypto markets are being scammed by savvy traders who know how to \"spoof\" the trading platforms and flood them with fake buy and sell orders. Such crimes can drive the price of a crypto way up, or cause it to plunge way down, apart from natural market forces.\nIt isn't exactly a good thing for the reputation of cryptocurrency in general, which requires honesty, transparency, and accountability if people are going to trust using it. That the crypto world is essentially rife with misconduct at this current juncture is precisely why the DoJ is now getting involved, along with the help of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivatives specifically tied to Bitcoin .\nWhile crypto exchanges are expected to go after these bad players themselves, this obviously doesn't always happen – hence the DoJ involvement. And with all of the crazy price swings with Bitcoin over the past year, many say there isn't a better time than now for regulators to start cracking down and cleaning up the crypto world.\nWhat the DoJ is specifically focused on are spoofing and wash trading, two forms of cheating that regulators have been working for years to eradicate from both the futures and equities markets. Spoofers essentially submit a spate of orders that they then cancel after prices have moved in the desired direction. Wash traders basically trade with themselves, which creates an illusion of artificial market demand, again in order to manipulate prices.\nThese criminal elements within the crypto trading world likely explain why Bitcoin rose from around $1,000 in early 2017 to almost $20,000 by the year's end. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering right around $7,500.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:43:17.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52e5950f4f34f2af83d48767d5ea599bdb3c1b38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKFNld5wQ4o6vyB3xFP8aoU_HfgueR918kRLW3yIf3GW80q_0Ph2_Q.V_CTlfR7bfcUyYwlEp.ijs-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.ar", "site": "freelancer.com.ar", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.ar/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Bitcoin pay functions in my website", "title_full": "Bitcoin pay functions in my website", "published": "2018-05-29T18:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52e5950f4f34f2af83d48767d5ea599bdb3c1b38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKFNld5wQ4o6vyB3xFP8aoU_HfgueR918kRLW3yIf3GW80q_0Ph2_Q.V_CTlfR7bfcUyYwlEp.ijs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T18:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin pay functions in my website", "text": "Bitcoin pay functions in my website\nI find someone who add bitcoin pay functions to my website!

In fact, he said, the sector is in need of some “real journalism,” according to Cointelegraph, which is hosting Blockshow.\n‘Right now, we are in a bubble. The crypto world is absolutely, definitely in a bubble. I don’t think there’s many people who would deny that.’ —Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia. It is not the first time Wales has piled on the industry. In an October interview, he warned investors of the risks around the popular, unregulated crowdfunding tools that raise money for cryptocurrencies.\n“There are a lot of these initial coin offerings, which are in my opinion absolute scams and people should be very wary of things that are going on in that area,” Wales said in an October 4 interview with CNBC .\nRead: The SEC created a fake ICO website to show just how easy it is to scam investors\nThe internet entrepreneur’s comments come as the No. 1 digital currency is in the midst of a dire stretch, coming off three consecutive weekly losses for the first time since September 2017, pushing bitcoin BTCUSD, +2.42% to a six-week low.\nDespite his negative outlook for the industry, there is a reason Wales may hope he is wrong — in 2014, Wikipedia announced it had started accepting bitcoin as a form of donation, which it still does today .

Sponsored Links\nAnyone who has ever spent time actively trading crypto assets or just spent time observing order books at large digital asset exchanges knows that the cryptocurrency market is still the “wild wild west” and price manipulation is omnipresent.\nWhile the market reacted negatively to this news, cleaning up bitcoin changes to make digital assets safer to trade for investors may turn out to be price positive in the long-run as it could attract more investors to this new digital asset class.\nLeading altcoins have followed suit and are down by ten to 20 percent week-on-week. Only TRON (TRX) managed to stay flat versus last week’s close.\nThis week’s contributions have been provided by Ogwu Osaemezu Emmanuel, Pratik Makadiya, Priyeshu Garg, and Shaurya Malwa.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has been keeping an eye on the alluring volatility of the price of bitcoin, with reports emerging of a launch of a criminal probe for price manipulation on exchanges.\nBloomberg reported May 24, 2018, the DoJ is not amused by bitcoin’s price swings, and is on the lookout for traders who dramatically influence the cryptocurrency market, which they state is “rife with misconduct.” The digital currencies under examination include bitcoin and ether.\nThe department has ordered for a thorough scrutinization of exchanges and traders, in a bid to find the origin of fraudulent market activities, such as “spoofing,” fake market orders, and other types of manipulation.\nFederal prosecutors and representatives of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an authority that oversees the cryptocurrency market, will lead the investigation.\nAccording to a report, the Indian government may impose an 18 percent GST on crypto-trading. Currently, this proposal is being considered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and is expected to be tabled before the GST Council once it is finalized.\nIt is also expected that cryptocurrencies could be classified under the category of “intangible goods,” such as software, and its use in illegal activities will have to be dealt with separately, under special criminal laws.\nHowever, all is not concrete, as the decision to tax cryptocurrencies will also depend on the outcome of the panel set up to find a way to regulate them. It is expected that while the Department of Economic Affairs seeks to regulate virtual currencies, investigative agencies want a ban.\nEarlier in April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had already barred lenders from dealing with enterprises dealing in cryptocurrencies and gave them an ultimatum of three months to unwind their businesses, rendering the first week of July 2018 as a death knell for Indian cryptocurrency traders. As per the dictum, banks were explicitly asked to withdraw all banking services for exchanges, thus cutting off the money supply.\nAccording to an official report by Russia’s lower house of parliament, the first draft of the new laws defining cryptocurrencies was approved by a majority, on May 22, 2018. A total of 410 deputies approved the bill, and only one voted against it.\nThe draft specified treating cryptocurrencies and digital tokens as a property, alongside introducing laws for all activities on digital assets and blockchain technology, such as mining, ICOs, and wallet services. Explaining the motive, the bill stated that digital tokens and cryptocurrencies are issued by a single entity, or a variety of entities, and contain “emission goals.” The bill added: “In this document, it is directly determined that digital financial assets do not constitute a legal method of payment within the territory of the Russian Federation.”\nTitled “On Digital Financial Assets,” the bill has been under consideration since 2017, and seemingly adheres with its July 1, 2018 deadline.\nThe Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused research community at MIT, are demonstrating an experimental use case in the backdrop of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network that would amalgamate smart contracts with the Bitcoin network to scale further.\nThe Lightning Network is an open protocol layer that is built on the bitcoin blockchain network, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. The new MIT pilot is not just limited to manage millions of transactions but to make it possible with added complexity.\nThe MIT test envisages a mechanism wherein transactions would occur automatically when certain defined conditions are met such as when the U.S dollar value meets a predefined price.\nTo make it possible, DCI’s Research Scientist Tadge Dryja and Head of Strategic Partnerships Alin S. Dragos developed “oracles” that would relay data to smart contracts. The demo is built as an independently operating feature of the Lightning Network software, first proposed in summer 2017.\nBitcoin Private Co-founder and cryptocurrency maverick, Rhett Creighton has leveled a series of remarkable allegations of theft, incompetence, mismanagement, and cover-ups against his former team in a blog post published on May 23, 2018.\nCreighton has been engaged in a public feud with the Bitcoin Private team since he was reportedly fired in April 2018. The allegations made by him range from the relatively minor such as incompetence and infighting to severe accusations including mismanagement of Treasury funds, fraud, bribery, and several coverups to prevent information from reaching the BTCP community.\nCreighton alleges that BTCP Strategy chief, Giuseppe Stuto accidentally paid 5.5 BTC to a developer Jon S. Layton when he intended to pay 0.55 BTC. In a series of screenshots posted showing the conversation between Stuto and Layton, Stuto repeatedly requested Layton to return the 5 BTC overpayment, and Layton shamelessly refused.\nFurthermore, Creighton tweeted an allegation stating that he was offered a bribe of 100,000 BTCP to enable Stuto and Brutman steal BTCP coins by writing fraudulent commits in the course of a coin burn. Both Stuto and Brutman have publicly denied the allegation, endorsing a tweet stating that Creighton is looking to take revenge on the team for removing him.\nEven with the reign of the bear market, it seems more and more financial institutions are seriously looking to join the bitcoin train. On May 24, 2018, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Borse AG has hinted it’s weighing the possibility of offering clients bitcoin and other crypto-related products.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the highly-reputed stock exchange has noted a more liberal approach towards bitcoin and other blockchain-based virtual currencies. Present at an industry event in London by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), the company’s head of clients, products, and core markets, Jeffrey Tessler, noted that the firm is carefully studying bitcoin and the underlying technology:\n“Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do. We are deep at work with it.”\nThe former Executive Vice president of the Bank of New York also hinted that the super volatile nature of the world’s flagship cryptocurrency, as well as the regulatory uncertainties surrounding the nascent digital assets industry, makes it crucial to study the ecosystem extensively before jumping in.\nAccording to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), the Ministry of Finance has deemed it necessary to suspend the crypto tax law as it has realized that the guideline is nonsensical. Amidst this backdrop, the Polish Finance Ministry plans to formulate another regulation after conducting an “in-depth analysis“ of the virtual currency industry.\n“The Ministry of Finance has accepted the irrational effect of the PCC tax on cryptocurrencies,” said Deputy Finance Minister, Pawel Gruza, adding: “So far, the Ministry hasn’t done anything about the PCC, except for recognizing cryptocurrencies as property rights which automatically means obligation to pay the civil law transaction tax.”\nThe Polish government’s decision to review the cryptocurrency tax regulation did not just happen ordinarily. In April 2018, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice, stating that all digital currency transactions attract an income tax of either 18 or 32 percent, plus an additional one percent levy tax since the government sees cryptocurrency trading as a transfer of property rights.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

The site developer who goes by /u/xur17 on Reddit spoke to CCN about their motivation for creating the site:\n“There was an attack against Bitcoin Gold a few days ago, which made me curious what the cost of an attack would be with rented hashing power. I did the math and was honestly kind of shocked – someone could attack a cryptocurrencies worth close to a billion dollar for < $10k an hour and even less than that if you include the block rewards.\nThis got me to calculate the same figures for other coins, and again it was cheaper than I thought it should be. The goal of the site is to drive more attention to what I see as a pretty glaring problem with these smaller coins. Hashing power is easily retargetable, so not only can people rent hashing power, the larger mining pools can redirect hashing power at smaller coins for a few hours to attack them.”\nThe picture below is taken from the crypto51 website which was posted on the cryptocurrency subreddit of Reddit yesterday. While other websites have much higher estimates for the cost of a 51% attack, they did not factor in the possibility of renting the mining equipment instead of buying it.\nCost of 51% Attack\nCryptocurrency mining rigs are very expensive, and the hardware required to execute an attack on even a small coin with few mining nodes to compete with would be astronomical, requiring server farms full of top-tier rigs and the electricity required on top of that. The hardware required to attack the Bitcoin network would cost over $1 billion, and hourly electricity costs over $500,000. However, it’s also possible to simply rent the hashing power from the NiceHash service which already has the hardware required to bring many different altcoins to their knees, according to xur17 of Crypto51.app.\nThe far right column which indicates that NiceHash only has 2% of the hardware required to attempt an attack on the Bitcoin network shows that the service could successfully be used to attack smaller networks like Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Private, MonaCoin, Bytecoin, and many others.\nIn fact, both Verge and Bitcoin Gold suffered a successful 51% attack just a week ago, with Bitcoin Gold losing $18 million to double spending. The attack made headlines, and it was assumed by many that a huge operation was behind the crypto-heist. However, it appears that NiceHash could be used to commandeer the BTG hash rate for under $4,000. The Crypto51.app site claims that NiceHash could be used to take over the hash rate of the Bytecoin networkworth over $1 billion for an entire hour for under $600, with other coins vulnerable to multi-million dollar attacks for equally minuscule costs.\nCharlie Lee of Litecoin is among the many people taking the numbers on the website seriously:\nhttps://t.co/HYejqons0V shows how easy it is to 51% attack some of the smaller PoW coins. For some coins, 100% of the hashrate can be rented from NiceHash, which removes the capital costs of the attack!\nFor example, Bytecoin (marketcap ~$1B) can be 51% attacked for $557!  pic.twitter.com/nQNQ0EtMV3\n— Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) May 29, 2018 What exactly is a 51% attack?\nA 51% attack enables attackers to control the “hash rate” of a currency and spend the same funds twice and fork the blockchain into two, creating different records. Double spending was always a problem with the notion of digital currency, and Bitcoin was invented with a solution in mind: blockchain and the Proof of Work system.\nThe blockchain ledger keeps a supposedly immutable record, and the PoW system requires mining computers to guess numbers and solve algorithms in order to verify transactions and add new blocks of data to the blockchain: the method used to guess the numbers is called “hashing”, and the “hash rate” is the number of guesses per second.\nA blockchain is stored on computers called nodes. Large networks have many nodes making them very expensive to attack due to the processing power required. However, networks with fewer nodes can be hijacked with less processing power. Anyone in control of 51% of the hash rate could, for example, send funds to an exchange and trade them for other coins, then use their hashing power to erase the transaction they just made, leaving them with the funds they sent and the funds they received.\nA 51% attack is theoretically possible on Proof of Stake systems as well, but the attackers would need to buy approximately half of the coin supply (an action that would cause the price to steadily increase as they bought up more coins), making it very expensive and also very difficult to estimate the true spending power required.\nIf the figures on the website are accurate the implications are huge, and a great many altcoins need to reconsider their security with the possibility of a 51% attack in mind. The use of the NiceHash service to cut costs makes it staggeringly easy for anyone in the know to attack a crypto-network, making the smaller Proof of Work coins extremely vulnerable, raising the question of why 51% attacks don’t happen more often, or indeed, whether they do and we just don’t know about it.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1001341159405273088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/HYejqons0V", "https://t.co/nQNQ0EtMV3"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:01:41.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ff154e976c0f27cc00f4b8f5f00c7366c6a3626", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLyycUgjjygosPYlzraRsF36xIKfuztVos_G4fsUH6.MSmY5wxxMfbLtSTsQLQmjuOpt75oyl_U7_ENBpxPooNKsqvdJqVWPjo-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – South Korea: Government Committee Plans to Make ICOs Legal Again", "title_full": "Bitcoin – South Korea: Government Committee Plans to Make ICOs Legal Again", "published": "2018-05-29T18:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.wp.com/abitco.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81NTQ4YzhhNzkyOTBhMzhiMDZmNzhjMTVjYjJjNDJlNC5qcGc=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ff154e976c0f27cc00f4b8f5f00c7366c6a3626", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLyycUgjjygosPYlzraRsF36xIKfuztVos_G4fsUH6.MSmY5wxxMfbLtSTsQLQmjuOpt75oyl_U7_ENBpxPooNKsqvdJqVWPjo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-29T18:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – South Korea: Government Committee Plans to Make ICOs Legal Again", "text": "Bitcoin – South Korea: Government Committee Plans to Make ICOs Legal Again 29 May 2018\nSouth Korea’s government wants to undo its ICO ban\nRead more –> click here all content is copyright CoinTelegraph.\nNeed Bitcoin marketing and PR?

Yes, but critically, officially sanctioned, that's very different,\" the chief economic advisor at Allianz told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\"Officially sanctioned\" could take the form of a government-issued digital coin, like bitcoin for example, but that's going to take \"many years,\" El-Erian said. \"It's not something that we're going to see in the next three to five years … because people's habits and people trusting in the new medium and change doesn't happen overnight.\"\nBut make no mistake, \"we are moving away from cash,\" said El-Erian, former CEO of Allianz-owned Pimco. \"Go to Sweden and you'll see how fast one can move away from cash.\"\nLinus Hook | Bloomberg via Getty Images\nSwedish krona notes and coins sit in a cashier's till.\nEarlier this month, CNBC looked into Sweden's efforts to ditch paper money. Just 2 percent of the total value of transactions there consist of cash, and that's expected to decline to less than 0.5 percent by 2020, according to research by Capgemini and BNP Paribas. Sweden is already considered the most cashless society in the world.\nSweden aside, \"cash still plays a pretty important,\" if diminishing, role around the world, El-Erian said.\nCase in point, cash purchases in the U.S. as a total value of transactions stood at 9 percent in 2015, according to research conducted by the Federal Reserve .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/id/43752521", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/29/el-erian-cashless-trend-may-lead-to-government-issued-cryptocurrency.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/29/el-erian-cashless-trend-may-lead-to-government-issued-cryptocurrency.html#", "https://www.frbsf.org/cash/files/FedNotes-The-State-of-Cash-Preliminary-Findings-2015-Diary-of-Consumer-Payment-Choice.pdf", "https://www.cnbc.com/mohamed-el-erian/", "https://www.cnbc.com/cryptocurrency/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/sweden-cashless-future-sounds-alarm-bells-for-the-central-bank.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:39:12.119+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce9d6aa34d17dd69ae64935efd3558b5a3073d76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqafZzZ0Qq6ycVHGe86eL5yJgXSi1DKHeObedNz_Efe1VGt0HNPQMNppg4Cx4yuQ0.1uZPXHQh2bG6v4SOe7Mk29w--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Cryptocurrency News: 21st - 27th of May (Coinbase, Verge, Ripple, Request, Funfair, Bitcoin)", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency News: 21st - 27th of May (Coinbase, Verge, Ripple, Request, Funfair, Bitcoin) : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-29T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce9d6aa34d17dd69ae64935efd3558b5a3073d76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqafZzZ0Qq6ycVHGe86eL5yJgXSi1DKHeObedNz_Efe1VGt0HNPQMNppg4Cx4yuQ0.1uZPXHQh2bG6v4SOe7Mk29w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dmaee", "published": "2018-05-29T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency News: 21st - 27th of May (Coinbase, Verge, Ripple, Request, Funfair, Bitcoin)", "text": "submitted by /u/dmaee\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaRkaWt8Wks"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T14:00:33.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "832fe892c67ac228df451b87226122e97d762111", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGgCDu4rxrs9H4lqk7wS68xxP.OahxPLVn_QRFtXf7M1jsGZoKno.iEYxBHbDIL7H6ONR2c0CUx3hHvgqliyk2yU-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Peer-to-obligatory-off-chain-channel-dependence-to-Peer is not truly peer to peer.

Not all casinos on the Internet are built the same.\nFor example, there are software companies that make auditing a top priority and you can often read reports from experts and players across the Net.\nLikewise, Bitcoin Games provides details explaining why their offerings are provably fair and how you as the player can determine this.\nWe guarantee that every Video Poker game you play at Bitcoin Games is completely fair. You will be dealt a completely random deck of cards every game, and we can provably demonstrate that we have in no way manipulated the shuffle.\nInstead of just taking our word for it, we make available all of the information you need to verify that our game is fair.\nThe reason that we can guarantee this is that your web browser supplies a random number that we must incorporate into the random number generator in a provably consistent way. Our server first shuffles the deck, and your computer then gives us a random number that we must use to repeatedly cut the deck. Since our servers do not know what random number your computer will send, we have no way of knowing how the shuffle will look in the end.\nTo manually verify a game that has been played, press the green verify button in the MY GAMES table after a game has been played.\nBitcoin has introduced an entire cottage industry of casino websites claiming to be provably fair but are not. Bitcoin Games, along with Satoshi Dice, are among the most recognized and established of the bitcoin casino products on the market today.\nWhen it comes to the typical online casino, including live dealer platforms and those that offer other forms of currency transactions beside cryptocurrencies, RTPs below 94% should be avoided. While the example of 94% might seem high, it is not. Gamblers hoping to make a consistent profit will be looking for an RTP of 98% and above.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

However, some fear it is now in danger of getting left behind by the hottest emerging asset class – cryptocurrency. One of the main reasons for this appears to be the dominance of the big banks over the UK economy.\nAlso Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future Banks Hindering Progress\nDespite having a thriving fintech startups scene, an established trading ecosystem and a leading role in the traditional fiat currencies market, London appears to be missing the boat with regards to the rush of institutional money flowing into crypto finance. Locations such as Tokyo, Chicago, New York and even San Francisco are taking the lead with regards to regulated platforms, OTC and hedge funds, as well as exchange-traded derivatives such as futures. And many people in the industry believe this is mainly due to the outsize influence that the banks have in the City.\n“Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs trader and current CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency market maker, told FT . “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX trading venue which recently announced a physical cryptocurrency exchange dedicated to serving just institutional clients, expects UK banks would only join the market next year. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he explained. Not Too Late?\nThere are also factors that support London’s position in the crypto market, such as CFD brokers like IG Group and Plus500 achieving success with retail traders as well as Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those that think that the matter is overstated.\n“The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance. These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to news.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset financial & cryptocurrency trading exchange.\nAnees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.”\nHow should London ensure that the crypto revolution does not pass it by?

Their ICO guidance service will be known as Inwage. Inwage Will Help Companies Raise the Maximum Funding from Their ICO\nBitwage have launched a couple of new services to add to their existing crypto payroll platform. The first is Inwage – an advisory firm to help clients creating initial coin offerings to achieve the best possible results.\nAccording to a Bitwage company blog post published earlier today:\n“Inwage leverages our experience in blockchain to build a highly secure turnkey solution for companies of all sizes to launch ICOs.”\nAs part of the Inwage service, companies will receive technical services comprising of: A complete website with options for Inwage to provide hosting. A secure signup process. KYC compliance. Payment processing. The development of necessary smart contracts. \\u00a0Auditing of existing smart contracts and website security.\nInwage are also offering clients various marketing services to boot. These have been developed with the help of a team of 16 marketers with experience targeting U.S., European, Middle Eastern, and East Asian markets. The services advertised by the blog post are: PR. Targeting of online influencers. Digital marketing. Content marketing. Social media advertising. Marketing at events.\nThe Bitwage blog post proudly reports the success of the first project they collaborated with – Moria, a company looking to tokenise investment into the extraction of precious metals. According to the blog, Moria raised $50 million – a figure that was around 40% higher than the $30 million target initially set for the token sale. The post reads:\n“In order to achieve this goal, they trusted the technical expertise and blockchain experience of InWage \\u2013 which not only advised on the ICO, but also helped with platform development, technical services, and security compliance.”\nThe second news from Bitwage is that they’ve launched support for Ethereum on their existing platform. They identified that firms who had run ICOs in the past struggled to pay their employees thanks to the difficulty many had encountered in setting up company bank accounts. Since many ICOs are created on the Ethereum network, it therefore made sense for Bitwage to extend their payroll services to support Ether too.\nBitwage have also stated that companies such as Status and Aragon had been using the service since January when the service was ‘soft launched.’\nThe Bitwage platform was initially launched in 2013 by founders John Lindsay and Jonathan Chester. They’ve spent the last couple of\\u00a0 years slowly expanding their Bitcoin payroll services across the globe. They provide the ability for employees and freelancers to receive payment directly in Bitcoin without the company itself needing to be crypto-literate. Last July, we reported on Bitwage’s successful launch in the U.K. Featured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Bitwage Launches ICO Guidance Platform Inwage and Rolls Out Ether Support ",
