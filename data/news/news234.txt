Teresa Kroeger / Getty Images Samantha Chang Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said bitcoin will emerge as the one global currency within the next decade.\nBillionaire Jack Dorsey reiterated his bullish outlook on bitcoin, saying the “internet is going to have a native currency,” and bitcoin will likely emerge as the winner.\nDorsey, who’s the CEO of both Twitter and of mobile-payments company Square Inc., made the comments May 16 during Blockchain Week , when more than 8,000 cryptocurrency enthusiasts descended on New York City to dissect and celebrate all things crypto.\n“The internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” said Dorsey, as reported by CNBC . “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be.” One Global Currency Within 10 Years\nDorsey, whose net worth tops $4.1 billion, previously said bitcoin will displace all currencies within the next decade.\n“The world ultimately will have a single currency, the Internet will have a single currency,” Dorsey told the Times of London in March, 2018. “I personally believe that it will be bitcoin.”\nWhile his company, Twitter, recently banned cryptocurrency advertising, Jack Dorsey said he personally is a “huge fan” of bitcoin, and of blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currencies.\nDorsey is especially bullish about bitcoin’s role in the future of payments, and expects people to start using cryptocurrencies to buy everything, including something as small as a cup of coffee. Bitcoin Price Tumbles After Twitter Bans Cryptocurrency Ads. #News https://t.co/D1icTZTpNm\n— INQUISITR (@theinquisitr) March 27, 2018\nDespite the bullishness of crypto evangelists like Dorsey, bitcoin has come under increased attacks by billionaires like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, who both trashed cryptocurrencies as passing trends.\nBuffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is a notorious crypto skeptic who says buying bitcoin is nothing more than reckless gambling .\n“You aren’t investing when you [buy cryptocurrency]. You’re speculating,” Buffett said. “There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble, somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow. That’s one kind of game. But that is not investing.” Billionaire Warren Buffett Trashes Bitcoin Again: 'That Is Not Investing'. #Economy #Business https://t.co/WVS15qV6bL\n— INQUISITR (@theinquisitr) April 28, 2018\nBuffett echoed the sentiments of four Nobel Prize-winning economists who say bitcoin’s true price should be zero, as the Inquisitr has reported. The price of one bitcoin token currently hovers at about $8,165.\n“Does the world really need another speculative asset?” Nobel Prize winner Angus Deaton asked. “The only advantage as far as I can see is you can be a crook. It’s not an accident that people who demand ransoms demand them in bitcoin.”\nBitcoin advocates dismiss the virulent anti-crypto sentiment, saying digital assets are the unstoppable wave of the future. The Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, said skeptics who can’t see the potential of cryptocurrencies suffer from a woeful “lack of imagination.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/theinquisitr/status/990355436791582721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/D1icTZTpNm", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Business?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/News?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/WVS15qV6bL", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Economy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/theinquisitr/status/978781438807105536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/twitter-ceo-wants-bitcoin-to-be-the-internets-native-currency.html", "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-will-become-the-worlds-single-currency-tech-chief-says-66slm0p6b"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teresa kroeger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images samantha chang twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "currencies twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:02:11.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "decbe4c246448beec9ccc9ecab7dc7660f9fd06a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA7Xf0mi2waJxaXtxKe5h5Wp5e8jCVM86GHpqetsmjnde0QNUcuMMg2DzcD5NrRQLjeN2feoStn70YXkBES.1VD2o0NG5ikQpJScEkiaba0s3fW1MsDhgik9H1AlTLF7Ls5.6BxZCoNRr7XjlRwcQLaCqVPRW1yIxn", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/business/rss.jhtml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes - Business", "title": "Consensus 2018: Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Snoop Dogg Close Bitcoin Conference", "title_full": "Consensus 2018: Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Snoop Dogg Close Bitcoin Conference", "published": "2018-05-17T21:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2Fc9ceeae12233427fac9d4f95f0c58f35%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "decbe4c246448beec9ccc9ecab7dc7660f9fd06a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA7Xf0mi2waJxaXtxKe5h5Wp5e8jCVM86GHpqetsmjnde0QNUcuMMg2DzcD5NrRQLjeN2feoStn70YXkBES.1VD2o0NG5ikQpJScEkiaba0s3fW1MsDhgik9H1AlTLF7Ls5.6BxZCoNRr7XjlRwcQLaCqVPRW1yIxn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Billy Bambrough", "published": "2018-05-17T21:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Consensus 2018: Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Snoop Dogg Close Bitcoin Conference", "text": "While Consensus 2018 failed to deliver the Bitcoin price bump many had been waiting for , there was still plenty of news coming out of the world's biggest Bitcoin conference. Here's a round up of the news from the last couple of days ( you can read all about Consensus 2018 day one here ).\nConsensus 2018: Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey is still into crypto\nConsensus 2018 attendees -- all 8,500 of them -- were eagerly awaiting Square and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey's so-called fireside chat with Elizabeth Stark, the chief executive of Lightning Labs.\nTwitter's @jack sat down with Stark, for the headline talk of the mammoth conference that has seen huge queues, Lamborghinis, and (later tonight) a performance by rap legend Snoop Dogg .\nDorsey -- who said the original inspiration for payments processor Square was to make taking payments as easy as talking -- said he wants cryptocurrencies like bitcoin adopted as global means of payment.\nDorsey said: \"I'm just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency.

Here's a round up of the news from the last couple of days ( you can read all about Consensus 2018 day one here ).\nConsensus 2018: Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey is still into crypto (but not necessarily Bitcoin)\nConsensus 2018 attendees -- all 8,500 of them -- were eagerly awaiting Square and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey's so-called fireside chat with Elizabeth Stark, the chief executive of Lightning Labs.\n@jack sat down with Stark for the headline talk of the mammoth conference yesterday.\nDorsey -- who said the original inspiration for payments processor Square was to make taking payments as easy as talking -- said he wants cryptocurrencies like bitcoin adopted as global means of payment.\nDorsey said: \"I'm just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don't know if it will be Bitcoin.\"\nDorsey said Square is now seeing people using Square as their primary bank account, with retailer Walmart and fast food giant McDonald's its two biggest companies for payments.\nSquare was one of the first mainstream financial services companies to accept Bitcoin way back in 2014.\nSquare Cash began supporting Bitcoin at the end of last year.\n\"Any payment that comes across our table, the seller should be able to accept,\" Dorsey added.\nDorsey told Stark that where he grew up in St. Lewis, Missouri, he was involved with a Usenet group called alt.cypherpunks -- which led to his first encounter with cryptocurrency and continued interest in it.\nConsensus 2018: HTC wants to put your phone on the blockchain\nSmartphone maker HTC is making an Android phone that will be powered by blockchain technology.\nFeaturing a universal wallet and a built-in secure hardware enclave to support cryptocurrencies and decentralised applications, the phone's development is being led by creator of HTC's virtual reality headset Vive, Phil Chen.\nChen said:\nThrough Exodus, we are excited to be supporting underlying protocols such as Bitcoin, Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and more.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nIf you fear missing out on the ICO (initial coin offering) gold rush but are uncertain which token to buy in today’s sea of offerings, you might want to check out this one called HoweyCoins which is certain to disrupt the luxury travel industry.\nBecause not only are HoweyCoins tradable on “an SEC-compliant exchange,” but the coins have been created by the SEC itself.\nWhen you click on any of the four “Buy Coins Nows!” buttons on the homepage, you will be taken to a government page with a warning at the top: “ If You Responded To An Investment Offer Like This, You Could Have Been Scammed—HoweyCoins Are Completely Fake!” The SEC created HoweyCoins.com to showcase what a typical ICO scam looks like and how easy it is to replicate one. The website, which includes all the key elements of an alluring ICO like celebrity endorsements, limited-time promotions and even a pitch-perfect white paper, was built “in-house in very little time,” the agency said in a statement. “We did this on a shoestring budget,” Lori Schock, the SEC’s Director of Investor Education and Advocacy, told CNBC. “The rapid growth of the ‘ICO’ market and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors,” said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton .\nSince January this year, the SEC has investigated and shut down a number of consumer-facing ICOs. The agency also regularly issues warnings and educational posts about the risk of ICOs.\nNevertheless, that doesn’t seem to stop the surge of websites touting new blockchain-based tokens to professional investors and amateurs alike. In the U.S. alone, there have been 445 ICOs to date that have raised a total of $2.7 billion, according to the latest report from ICO tracking site, ICObench. “We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,” Clayton said. Here are five red flags the SEC advises you to be aware of: 1. Claims of high, guaranteed returns;3. Claims of “SEC-compliant” exchanges to trade tokens; 4. Acceptance of credit card payment; 5. Any kind of “early bird” specials that promise higher returns.

For much of the fund's history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6% and 10% of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin—ARRK’s internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW) .\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), was a major driver behind both these funds’ returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87% in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550%.\nHere’s the ETFs’ rally last year:\nHere’s their impressive rally relative to GBTC’s:\nCharts courtesy of StockCharts.com\nBut these ETFs’ big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5% and 0.6% in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the “complicated decision” to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the “merits” of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin—as measured by GBTC—rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37%, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63% in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15% year-to-date.)\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF—many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring—investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\nContact Cinthia Murphy at [email protected] Related ETFs", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://www.stockcharts.com/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "arrk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "factset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin investment trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gbtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:34:45.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c69e9c8f6b8ef5827a4523d533b846901ee5b6e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSa4IlOUDHI9OTvdGhjGrs0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "title_full": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c69e9c8f6b8ef5827a4523d533b846901ee5b6e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSa4IlOUDHI9OTvdGhjGrs0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "threegods", "published": "2018-05-17T21:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "text": "It was just huge hype around bitcoin , people was screaming about easy money, big potential and other promising stuff.

So when major players in the space double down on one coin in particular, it’s worth taking notice.\nOn Tuesday, the Winklevoss twin’s bitcoin exchange Gemini announced the addition of trading and custody for a coin called zcash, starting May 22. The price of zcash quickly shot up more than 40% on the news, from around $250 a coin to over $360.\nThe US-based Gemini is small compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges, but it is also fairly selective. The exchange presently only lets users trade the two most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, so the addition of a new coin is a sign that it sees a future for zcash.\nZcash is a lot like bitcoin in that it lives on blockchain technology and is designed to be used as digital money. But it has one key thing that bitcoin doesn’t: privacy.\nGemini’s VP of engineering Eric Winer called it “a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded” by normal money.\nThis is because unlike bitcoin, which keeps a permanent record of every single transaction in meticulous detail, zcash lets users choose when to hide their identity or the amount of currency being moved around.\nHere’s what you need to know about zcash: Zcash is run by a venture-backed startup, but it’s open source\nZcash (ZEC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed and maintained by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, or Zcash Company, a venture-backed startup founded by Zooko Wilcox (that’s his real name, though the Z in Zcash apparently stands for zero, not Zooko).\nZcash Company built the platform and pays a team of engineers to maintain it, though decisions about how to govern the platform fall to the Zcash Foundation.\nBecause Zcash is open source, anyone with the technical know-how can make changes to the code and create what’s known in the space as a “hard fork” — an update which splits the cryptocurrency into two different coins. But the Foundation makes it so that those decisions can be made by a somewhat neutral party.\nThis is in contrast to a coin like XRP, the cryptocurrency controlled by the company Ripple. While Ripple has recently taken actions to decentralize XRP, its corporate origins have given some people in the crypto community pause and made it unlikely to trade on exchanges like Coinbase.\nToday, there are around 3.9 million zcash coins in the world. Like bitcoin, zcash transactions are processed by miners who volunteer their computer power in exchange for newly generated coins.\nBut unlike on bitcoin, when a miner mines zcash, some of the newly generated coins go to the Zcash Company and Foundation. The company treats these coins as revenue, and use them to pay its engineers and leadership team, as well as investors. Zcash is like bitcoin but transactions can be made privately\nThe price of zcash spiked on May 14 when Gemini announced its support for the coin. CoinMarketCap\nZcash is designed to be more practical than other cryptocurrencies.\n“It’s similar to bitcoin in most respects,” said Jack Gavigan, chief operating officer at Zcash Company. “The key difference is that with bitcoin, all details are transparently visible on the bitcoin blockchain, and with zcash you have the option of shielding the coin.”\nShielding the coin means that in any given transaction, the sender and receiver can hide their identities as well as the amount of currency being moved. The blockchain will record that a shielded transaction occurred, but it won’t say what specifically happened.\nGavigan believes this makes zcash more friendly to both consumers and privacy-focused regulations like Europe’s GDPR — two factors which could increase the chance of the cryptocurrency being used by businesses or by average people in their day-to-day lives.\n“Privacy is a common requirement that people want and it’s mandated by law in certain jurisdictions,” Gavigan said. “Would you like it if your credit card statements and bank statement were published on the internet?”\nBut zcash also lets people leave their transactions public, which may be useful in some case, such as auditing “how foreign aid is distributed or paid.” It means a single cryptocurrency can be used to privately pay rent or receive a salary, as well as publicly move money across borders. It also costs less money to make transactions on the blockchain\nOne concern that has emerged with bitcoin is that its price-per-transaction can get so expensive at times that it is impractical to make small purchases using the cryptocurrency. In December, for example, when bitcoin was at its peak price, it cost up to $55 in mining fees to make a single transaction. So if you bought a $1 item using bitcoin at that time, you paid $55 in fees on that purchase.\nBut this isn’t an issue with zcash since it has larger block sizes and blocks are created more frequently on zcash than they are on bitcoin, according to Gavigan. Zcash blocks are mined every 2.5 minutes, compared to every 10 minutes on bitcoin.\nBut like bitcoin, it could also fork at any time. The code is open source, and it’s possible that there will be disagreements in the zcash community which are so disruptive that two separate coins are created.\nYou can read more about forks here.\nThis has happened with bitcoin numerous times, which is how we ended up with both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. And while it could happen with zcash eventually, Gavigan doesn’t foresee any major forks in the future.\nHowever, there are still upgrades coming. The zcash crew is preparing a new edition of zcash called Sapling, which it will release in September.\nCurrently, transactions on zcash take 30 to 40 seconds to process since the cryptography associated with the coin is so intense. But Gavigan said the update with drastically reduce this processing time, “bring more efficient transactions and open up the usability of zcash a bit more.” Page 1 of 2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsallbuzz.com%2Fheres-what-you-need-to-know-about-zcash-a-privacy-focused-bitcoin-competitor-that-just-got-a-major-boost%2F&title=Here%27s+what+you+need+to+know+about+Zcash%2C+a+privacy-focused+bitcoin+competitor+that+just+got+a+major+boost", "http://connect.mail.ru/share?share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsallbuzz.com%2Fheres-what-you-need-to-know-about-zcash-a-privacy-focused-bitcoin-competitor-that-just-got-a-major-boost%2F", "https://www.xing.com/social_plugins/share?h=1;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsallbuzz.com%2Fheres-what-you-need-to-know-about-zcash-a-privacy-focused-bitcoin-competitor-that-just-got-a-major-boost%2F&title=Here%27s+what+you+need+to+know+about+Zcash%2C+a+privacy-focused+bitcoin+competitor+that+just+got+a+major+boost", "http://www.yummly.com/urb/verify?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsallbuzz.com%2Fheres-what-you-need-to-know-about-zcash-a-privacy-focused-bitcoin-competitor-that-just-got-a-major-boost%2F&title=Here%27s+what+you+need+to+know+about+Zcash%2C+a+privacy-focused+bitcoin+competitor+that+just+got+a+major+boost", "http://vkontakte.ru/share.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsallbuzz.com%2Fheres-what-you-need-to-know-about-zcash-a-privacy-focused-bitcoin-competitor-that-just-got-a-major-boost%2F&item=Here%27s+what+you+need+to+know+about+Zcash%2C+a+privacy-focused+bitcoin+competitor+that+just+got+a+major+boost", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "weibo xing mailru yummly jenny", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric winer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:06:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c78557d76b1971453913c51e981338223edd51c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4x055V_7Pm9bfO_oJQoR2MsncEtPY0.gr6BIv.mMwmafCPKxtjv9gXyjs.EONE4LTXrrfEjLyzXE.oM0cXtkVQL9VQC_Lq.6EqggdClX8QiCoQ0v6q0D3OZTARfVpqYYzn25e8q6ssSw759Oi36vGHL3p9QgmJ_b6VqCW3dhPCw--", "site_full": "www.bitcoinassociation.ch", "site": "bitcoinassociation.ch", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Giacomo Zucco joins the Bitcoin Association as board member", "title_full": "Giacomo Zucco joins the Bitcoin Association as board member", "published": "2018-05-17T21:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5895d62d2994ca86b0cd9807/t/5afd7420758d467e13326477/1526563299088/Voting+at+the+General+Assembly?format=1000w", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c78557d76b1971453913c51e981338223edd51c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4x055V_7Pm9bfO_oJQoR2MsncEtPY0.gr6BIv.mMwmafCPKxtjv9gXyjs.EONE4LTXrrfEjLyzXE.oM0cXtkVQL9VQC_Lq.6EqggdClX8QiCoQ0v6q0D3OZTARfVpqYYzn25e8q6ssSw759Oi36vGHL3p9QgmJ_b6VqCW3dhPCw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T21:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Giacomo Zucco joins the Bitcoin Association as board member", "text": "May 17, 2018\nThe Bitcoin scene in Switzerland has been strong since Mike Hearn, former Bitcoin developer and author of Bitcoinj , organized the first local Bitcoin meetup in February 2011 . Over the years we have grown from a handful of people to over 5’500 Bitcoiners , making Switzerland home to one of the biggest Bitcoin communities in the world .\nTo foster this development the not-for-profit Bitcoin Association Switzerland (BAS) was founded. Since 2013 we serve as a vehicle to talk to regulators and organize educational and networking events, making us one of the oldest Bitcoin Associations of the world.\nOn May 16th 2018, the Bitcoin Association Switzerland held it’s 6th Annual General Assembly. At the general assembly the most engaged members of our community come together to discuss the past years and future activities.\nThe last year has been one of the most successful years for Bitcoin and the BAS. The number of Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland members grew more than 100% (2’000 to 5’500), the number of corporate members increased from 9 to 65 and the number of events we organize from 30 to 45. While we had constructive talks with Swiss regulators the Bitcoin price rose to 8’263 CHF ;)\nThe entire association and our endeavours is run on a volunteer-basis, by unpaid individuals driven by the idea behind Bitcoin.\nThe Swiss have a thing for voting, you say? Giacomo Zucco Joins the Board\nMyself and the entire BAS board would like to thank our former board member Mathieu Buffenoir Gonzalez for his work over the last years. Serving on the board since 2014, Mathieu represented the non-German speaking part of Switzerland and helped building up the Geneva Bitcoin community.\nI’m very happy to welcome Giacomo Zucco on the BAS board. Giacomo is a perfect fit for the board of the Bitcoin Association because of his long-time involvement in the Bitcoin community and achievements in educating corporates as much as individuals. In 2015 Giacomo co-founded AssoB.it, the main Bitcoin Association in Italy as well as the Milan Bitcoin Meetup.

His argument of late is that bitcoin is going to be the currency of the future, telling the Consensus Blockchain Conference in New York Wednesday that “the Internet needs a native currency, and I hope it’s bitcoin.” He was even more bullish in an interview with the U.K. publication The Times, saying he thought bitcoin would surpass the dollar as the world’s currency of choice within a decade.\nA man who’s launched two companies worth a combined $50 billion, even if they aren’t quite profitable , deserves the benefit of the doubt. But given bitcoin’s recent price collapse, growing technological problems, and complete failure to actually get people outside of failed states to use it as money for anything other than illicit activities, it may be time for Jack to take his meds. And we’re not the only ones concerned, as Dorsey himself reports that Square’s decision to act as a bitcoin market maker for its Square Cash customers is highly controversial at the company, even up to the board level.\nSquare board members can rest easy for now, as the company reports its losses on bitcoin holdings have been insignificant, while revenue from bitcoin sales hit a healthy $34 million due in part to Square’s healthy bid-ask spread on bitcoin transactions. But Dorsey’s unexplained conviction that the Internet “deserves” a native currency, outside of those managed and issued by democratic governments, is one that should give us all pause.\nDorsey came up with the idea for Square after a friend of his was unable to sell a piece of glasswork to a customer abroad, because there was no way for him to accept the customer’s foreign credit card. This got Dorsey investigating the payments business and found that there was space for innovation in payments services, or the technical work that enables a lending bank to issue mini loans to customers via a credit card, and transfer those funds quickly to merchants around the world. Square has been one of fintech’s biggest success stories, but it’s important to keep the firm’s success in context. Despite projecting 30% revenue growth in 2018, the firm’s top line will be just $1.33 billion this year, while Visa’s will be fifteen times that, and growing in the high single digits.\nSquare and competitors Stripe, Ayden, and Paypal have fared well in the world of rapidly growing e-commerce, but the promised disruption of financial services has never come. Visa, JPMorgan, and the Federal Reserve are more powerful today than ever before. So where does Jack get the idea that the world is yearning for a native digital currency?\nFor one, it would be good for Square’s business. “If we were able to use it [as] a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in,” he told the Consensus Conference, complaining that the complex web of laws and regulations demanded by fiat currencies makes it uneconomical for Square to be available in most countries.\nWhat never seems to occur to Dorsey or other Silicon Valley luminaries is that those complex webs of laws and regulations may have been put there for a reason. Central banking is a discipline that has been developed over hundreds of years of trial and error, and now does a relatively decent job of keeping a lid on involuntary unemployment. Know-thy-customer laws have been built up, again, over the centuries so that law enforcement agencies can stop terrorism and organized crime.\nDorsey’s cluelessness is a microcosm of Silicon Valley’s persistent blind spot to its own unintended consequences. But while Uber and Facebook snuck into many jurisdictions before voters and officials knew what was happening, voters and government officials are ready this time around for any whiff of venture-backed tech companies swooping in to establish themselves before a democratic process can weigh in.\nLondon’s ban of Uber is the latest evidence that Silicon Valley companies will no longer be given the benefit of the doubt. But at least in the case of the car sharing company, there’s an obvious demand for the product, even if that demand is propped up by artificially low prices. There’s no evidence whatsoever that the typical citizen of a stable democracy is demanding a new technology to replace the U.S. dollar. And the more Dorsey claim’s the shift is inevitable, the greater resistance he will find.\nChristopher Matthews is a writer who splits his time between New York City and Accra, Ghana, with an interest in the intersection of markets, the economy, and public policy.

Nevertheless, cryptos fell 50 % within the first three months of 2018 and with the costs now at $eight,289 bitcoin the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has dropped $11,494 since Jan.\nNevertheless, Mr Walker says that the seeds for the Bitcoin and blockchain growth had been sowed in March 2014. He stated: “A webpage began circulating on social media itemizing how Blockchain – Bitcoin model or in any other case – might remedy an extended checklist of issues.\n“No clarification of how or why it could be higher.”\nThis checklist included strategies to “retailer nuclear launch codes on the blockchain” and though a few of the claims had been edited out, “the checklist ended up within the stories of significant consultancies, the media and governments”.\nThe “fad” then developed for speaking up bitcoin and blockchain at each finance convention or keynote handle and Mr Walker says that senior figures within the banking world are responsible of believing in an concept “with out checking whether or not there’s good proof it really works.” He argues that blockchain was being utilized because the potential resolution no matter whether or not or not it really “match the issue”.\nSo how in 2018 ought to the UK authorities deal with bitcoin and blockchain?\nMr Walker says that blockchain as a household of applied sciences must be handled by UK lawmakers like some other know-how “ie ‘Is it a great resolution to the issue?’ versus a perception system”.\nHe provides that, in six months, we’ll see extra gradual progress on the enterprise aspect for actual purposes however count on individuals to query why a few of these purposes want to make use of Blockchain kind options.\nOn the transfer in direction of regulation from the UK’s Monetary Conduct Authority, he provides that there are “excellent public curiosity grounds for setting up essentially the most restrictive regulatory regime potential round cryptocurrencies, banning the place obligatory and potential”.\nNevertheless he warns: “If cryptocurrency costs bounce again, we’ll most likely get one other cycle of hype. In the event that they go sideways or the downwards pattern continues there will likely be extra out of pocket buyers complaining that ‘regulators ought to have achieved one thing’.”\nLastly, on the latest strikes by Goldman Sachs and the New York Inventory Change in direction of Bitcoin futures and swap trades, he warns, “I feel it must be apparent to anybody that has paid any consideration to the standard monetary sector over the past 20 years that if there’s cash to be made – regardless of how harmful the monetary product – somebody will plunge in.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin", "http://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/953672/Bitcoin-price-MPs-Parliament-ripple-cryptocurrency-ethereum-BTC-to-USD-XRP-news"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicky morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin walker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for proof primarily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hm treasury select committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york inventory change", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:28:03.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3c9e04fe3b18690cdcf1620d981359686d9e042", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j_brEs_tJhoEOR88LcB8Bmju0h65452CCogcEdce9K.c_UQx_SxHbE0mOQlR3l4w6nMOASOPwZnmsOyBJSM8PWsz7SmvzHbBZFCwb8ozHx7XwSqqGapoEXw--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "title_full": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "published": "2018-05-17T21:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/a6dd7a509143665d393069e9cfae543b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e3c9e04fe3b18690cdcf1620d981359686d9e042", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j_brEs_tJhoEOR88LcB8Bmju0h65452CCogcEdce9K.c_UQx_SxHbE0mOQlR3l4w6nMOASOPwZnmsOyBJSM8PWsz7SmvzHbBZFCwb8ozHx7XwSqqGapoEXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cointelegraph", "published": "2018-05-17T21:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "text": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York May 17, 2018 38 In the US , China , and South Korea , many individual cryptocurrency miners and large-scale mining centers were cracked down for conducting illicit operations. For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos. Chicken farm in South Korea\nIn South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts.\nOn April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city . An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.\nBy disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed. Image source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani\nIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.\nThe group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.\nPreliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.\nCurrently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates. First mining ban in New York\nIn the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.\nThe city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:\n“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.” Another cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said :\n“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”\nAt the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks. Not illegal\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.\nCryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries. YiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and “guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner” by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protection\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) January 6, 2018\nIt is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions. This is why South Korean authorities are currently drafting regulations to prevent mining facilities from taking advantage of cities with cheaper electricity.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/south-korea", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ban-complete-china-blocks-foreign-crypto-exchanges-to-counter-financial-risks", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/revenues-down-hashrates-up-2018-mining-outlook-by-the-numbers", "http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/area/841224.html", "https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/949468263800479744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2018/db0215/DOC-349258A1.pdf", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/us", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/bitcoin-mining-banned-for-first-time-in-upstate-new-york-town", "http://www.cityofplattsburgh.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=229"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nam yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:31:14.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41986321dcc53056de5b591fa42576a6cc6efcf2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNMmnYhY_ES2JAIrefJp0Hiq.uf8KoCRw.UQW47ZhcE2GXwWWPmDiVMFEpE.xSkfxem43zPZqnrxXqhj3PHgUnYAqVuX1T5gioIm1BRWrDBz34wMmf15xk3XLE89AsnFYDoBP28qZLleh3_Z8BslQzEw--", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "https://redliontrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RedlionTrader", "title": "Here’s what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "title_full": "Here’s what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "published": "2018-05-17T21:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41986321dcc53056de5b591fa42576a6cc6efcf2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNMmnYhY_ES2JAIrefJp0Hiq.uf8KoCRw.UQW47ZhcE2GXwWWPmDiVMFEpE.xSkfxem43zPZqnrxXqhj3PHgUnYAqVuX1T5gioIm1BRWrDBz34wMmf15xk3XLE89AsnFYDoBP28qZLleh3_Z8BslQzEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BusinessInsider", "published": "2018-05-17T21:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here’s what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "text": "Here’s what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost Posted By: BusinessInsider May 17, 2018 Forget bitcoin and ethereum, there’s a new cryptocurrency in town: zcash. The Winklevoss twin’s cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced on Monday that it would start trading zcash on May 22. This sent the price spiking up more than 40%. Here’s everything you need to know about zcash.\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, it can often feel like there is an innumerable amount of coins to invest in. So when major players in the space double down on one coin in particular, it’s worth taking notice.\nOn Tuesday, the Winklevoss twin’s bitcoin exchange Gemini announced the addition of trading and custody for a coin called zcash, starting May 22. The price of z cash quickly shot up more than 40% on the news, from around $250 a coin to over $360.\nThe US-based Gemini is small compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges, but it is also fairly selective. The exchange presently only lets users trade the two most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, so the addition of a new coin is a sign that it sees a future for zcash.\nZcash is a lot like bitcoin in that it lives on blockchain technology and is designed to be used as digital money. But it has one key thing that bitcoin doesn’t: privacy.\nGemini’s VP of engineering Eric Winer called it “a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded” by normal money.\nThis is because unlike bitcoin, which keeps a permanent record of every single transaction in meticulous detail, zcash lets users choose when to hide their identity or the amount of currency being moved around.\nHere’s what you need to know about zcash: Zcash is run by a venture-backed startup, but it’s open source\nZcash (ZEC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed and maintained by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, or Zcash Company, a venture-backed startup founded by Zooko Wilcox (that’s his real name, though the Z in Zcash apparently stands for zero, not Zooko).\nZcash Company built the platform and pays a team of engineers to maintain it, though decisions about how to govern the platform fall to the Zcash Foundation.\nBecause Zcash is open source, anyone with the technical know-how can make changes to the code and create what’s known in the space as a “hard fork”— an update which splits the cryptocurrency into two different coins. But the Foundation makes it so that those decisions can be made by a somewhat neutral party.\nThis is in contrast to a coin like XRP, the cryptocurrency controlled by the company Ripple. While Ripple has recently taken actions to decentralize XRP, its corporate origins have given some people in the crypto community pause and made it unlikely to trade on exchanges like Coinbase.\nToday, there are around 3.9 million zcash coins in the world. Like bitcoin, zcash transactions are processed by miners who volunteer their computer power in exchange for newly generated coins.\nBut unlike on bitcoin, when a miner mines zcash, some of the newly generated coins go to the Zcash Company and Foundation. The company treats these coins as revenue, and use them to pay its engineers and leadership team, as well as investors. Zcash is like bitcoin but transactions can be made privately\nZcash is designed to be more practical than other cryptocurrencies.\n“It’s similar to bitcoin in most respects,” said Jack Gavigan, chief operating officer at Zcash Company. “The key difference is that with bitcoin, all details are transparently visible on the bitcoin blockchain, and with zcash you have the option of shielding the coin.”\nShielding the coin means that in any given transaction, the sender and receiver can hide their identities as well as the amount of currency being moved. The blockchain will record that a shielded transaction occurred, but it won’t say what specifically happened.\nGavigan believes this makes zcash more friendly to both consumers and privacy-focused regulations like Europe’s GDPR — two factors which could increase the chance of the cryptocurrency being used by businesses or by average people in their day-to-day lives.\n“Privacy is a common requirement that people want and it’s mandated by law in certain jurisdictions,” Gavigan said. “Would you like it if your credit card statements and bank statement were published on the internet?”\nBut zcash also lets people leave their transactions public, which may be useful in some case, such as auditing “how foreign aid is distributed or paid.” It means a single cryptocurrency can be used to privately pay rent or receive a salary, as well as publicly move money across borders. It also costs less money to make transactions on the blockchain\nOne concern that has emerged with bitcoin is that its price-per-transaction can get so expensive at times that it is impractical to make small purchases using the cryptocurrency. In December, for example, when bitcoin was at its peak price, it cost up to $55 in mining fees to make a single transaction. So if you bought a $1 item using bitcoin at that time, you paid $55 in fees on that purchase.\nBut this isn’t an issue with zcash since it has larger block sizes and blocks are created more frequently on zcash than they are on bitcoin, according to Gavigan. Zcash blocks are mined every 2.5 minutes, compared to every 10 minutes on bitcoin.\nBut like bitcoin, it could also fork at any time. The code is open source, and it’s possible that there will be disagreements in the zcash community which are so disruptive that two separate coins are created.\nYou can read more about forks here .\nThis has happened with bitcoin numerous times, which is how we ended up with both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. And while it could happen with zcash eventually, Gavigan doesn’t foresee any major forks in the future.\nHowever, there are still upgrades coming. The zcash crew is preparing a new edition of zcash called Sapling, which it will release in September.\nCurrently, transactions on zcash take 30 to 40 seconds to process since the cryptography associated with the coin is so intense. But Gavigan said the update with drastically reduce this processing time, “bring more efficient transactions and open up the usability of zcash a bit more.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko_Wilcox-O%27Hearn", "https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange-dfa7da992816", "http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blockchain-how-does-it-work-explainer-2017-11"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:30:45.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f9b8126bcf89dfa498cc44b50a0aff2adf95d1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqq3i02RQzTBn3dOYsMG6Aclta9ufoWavbcfjt0xaQh0IuF1tEieVRG3KSyvx8s5wkU1ElJcHXMnziTegBgWtERczb2o239V5FW6kaThE9qAGKm6SMcHGTg3nUjq8kcjTtH1uVA_3iruImM7YqVrd8qQLd10I2Ll.rmLEr3gh.Ao1RIrbt2lUmZ.ye6bDMhygQ-", "site_full": "technewstube.com", "site": "technewstube.com", "site_section": "http://technewstube.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tech News Tube RSS Feed", "title": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "title_full": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "published": "2018-05-17T21:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5afdb422e988ef49008b4df0-2400/winklevoss-zcash-2x1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f9b8126bcf89dfa498cc44b50a0aff2adf95d1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqq3i02RQzTBn3dOYsMG6Aclta9ufoWavbcfjt0xaQh0IuF1tEieVRG3KSyvx8s5wkU1ElJcHXMnziTegBgWtERczb2o239V5FW6kaThE9qAGKm6SMcHGTg3nUjq8kcjTtH1uVA_3iruImM7YqVrd8qQLd10I2Ll.rmLEr3gh.Ao1RIrbt2lUmZ.ye6bDMhygQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Becky Peterson", "published": "2018-05-17T21:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "text": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost By Becky Peterson May 17, 2018, 2:20 pm 21 pts Forget bitcoin and ethereum, there's a new cryptocurrency in town: zcash.

Lightning: 1997 Nodes, 6600 Channels, $150,000 Capacity\nData captured from an overview of LN’s Bitcoin mainnet integration showed 1997 reachable nodes (with the actual number presumably much higher) at press time, with 6614 open channels and a total network capacity in excess of $150,000.\nDespite remaining a challenging tool in terms of user interface, the technology has markedly improved in the approximately five months it has been active.\nIn addition to countless bespoke tools and add-ons building out its ecosystem, Lightning’s credibility has already earned it accolades from players including Microsoft, which in February championed layered Bitcoin scaling solutions.\nSpeaking at Consensus 2018 conference this week, Blockstream researcher and software developer Christian Becker noted that with enough Lightning channels, each of which can process around 500 transactions per second, Bitcoin could beat the transaction capacity of both other cryptocurrencies and Visa.\nAs more users begin interacting with the network, its impact on Bitcoin transactions has hit the headlines.\nTaking to social media, Yalls.org creator Alex Bosworth uploaded evidence of the savings possible using LN to make sales against performing the same transaction via a credit card.\nIn Bosworth’s case, a 2.9% charge, $0.30 in fees and a $0.50 minimum processing fee contrasts sharply with Lightning, which as Bitcoinist previously reported , can be used de facto for free and enables sending amounts less than a satoshi (one hundred millionth of a bitcoin and the smallest possible unit that can be used on-chain).

Finance.\n“Now, I feel like we’ve entered into a ‘Bitcoin, not blockchain’ world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring.”\nWhat do you think about the Lightning Network’s growth?

Photo: Reuters\nLondon: Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, currently uses almost as much power as Ireland does, and could be consuming about 0.5% of the world’s total electricity by the end of this year, a study has found.\nBitcoin’s burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency’s wildly fluctuating value. However, estimating exactly how much electricity the bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts—as much as Austria and 0.5% of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. If the price of bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, De Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as “mining” bitcoin.\nHowever, all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power. “You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the bitcoin being mined. That information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.\n 12 40 PM IST", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters london", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:44:06.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21e4b3ebb3ef909d95d9916ab973f2f1a19fbd0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfASe3X_PP_zCIUjoDbGDbk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin to Give Spending power to non bank people", "title_full": "Bitcoin to Give Spending power to non bank people", "published": "2018-05-17T21:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21e4b3ebb3ef909d95d9916ab973f2f1a19fbd0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfASe3X_PP_zCIUjoDbGDbk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Skyonito", "published": "2018-05-17T21:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin to Give Spending power to non bank people", "text": "yes, some people dont use bank for financial problems or other motives", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:23:18.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c6ede6a76fc8a39583711cac6dad035bdbf0cf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIiu7xIFbVPjqE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "published": "2018-05-17T21:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.15, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c6ede6a76fc8a39583711cac6dad035bdbf0cf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIiu7xIFbVPjqE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "chikading2016", "published": "2018-05-17T21:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "text": "Quote: from: Butchick on May 17, 2018, 12:37:08 PM bitcoin is both a currency and an investment and that is one advantage of bitcoin and it can either be a long term investment or a short term investment. however, long term investment with bitcoin is more beneficial than that of a short term since profits will be much higher. though there is a risk in it and the time needed for it to gain profit may be uncertain but surely, it will be worth it.\nI choose bitcoin because it is an investment.

However, while most may have heard of it by this point, it’s safe to say that not everyone is quite as savvy with the definition as others. If you are one of those people, you’re in luck! Below, we’re exploring just what Bitcoin is and how it could potentially be used in everyday life. IMAGE: PIXABAY What Is Bitcoin?\nCreated back in 2009 by an anonymous entity known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was originally designed to be a peer-to-peer alternative of electronic cash and has since built up a rapport as what’s now known as ‘cryptocurrency’. With key features including unique encryption security and a decentralized network from which it runs, Bitcoin and the blockchain technology it operates on have been hailed as revolutionary to financial markets.\nHowever, there have been some bumps in the road and concerns regarding the volatility of the Bitcoin value but regardless of these concerns, it’s still proving to be the most popular cryptocurrency to date. Where Can It Be Spent?\nOf course, the big question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin can be spent and if it can, what it can be spent on . The answer to that question is a simple ‘anything!’ Bitcoin’s first ever material transaction came in the form of two large Papa John’s pizzas and even the most unexpected of industries have since started to increase their overall acceptance of the cryptocurrency. The likes of Microsoft and Expedia have opened up to accepting bitcoin payments and smaller retailers across the globe are also allowing for payments with these digital coins, so there’s plenty you can do with your bitcoins when you have them. While it isn’t likely to be nearly as common as traditional fiat currencies anytime in the near future, the potential that these digital currencies hold is huge. Is It Worth Investing?\nWith that in mind, the question remains as to whether or not it’s worth investing in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, there’s no simple answer to this question but there’s plenty of advice for you to take into account before making the decision for yourself.\nThe biggest concern that most investors have regarding the cryptocurrency is whether money can still be made. Bitcoin hit its highest in December 2017 when it fell just short of $20,000, but has since fallen to around $8,000 on average. Despite its fall, the potential for another rise is still there, but the risks involved could deter some beginners from trying their hand at investing regardless. However, those with a little more experience could be willing to ride the volatility wave and ultimately make a lot of money while doing so.\nBut what about the everyday spender? If you have some cash to spare that you’d like to invest in Bitcoin, it could be a worthwhile investment simply due to the potential that it holds. Alternatively, there are other cryptocurrencies available with arguably more affordable prices and more stable markets. This is a matter of personal preference, however, so make sure you do your research into each before making that all-important investing decision!\nThe future of Bitcoin is one that is difficult to predict but investors, traders and everyday consumers are considering it regardless. With pros and cons associated with the cryptocurrency, understanding just what it is and what you could do with it is always a good place to start, and hopefully, our simple guide has helped you do just that.\n cryptocurrency- PIXABAY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.etoro.com/markets/btc"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james wood", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:12:07.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66722db07e7efa5f34a72d2501f06b9039b238b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jzJlJrCqgiv3waIL2FrF0nxj1T4wNx66SfxIxSCjt6IDG5fkWUroHFv4.2z8efFnsML6jPhp6w7oem6z6qzk53EHmLBawANw0iIXXI2bEH2M-", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal", "title_full": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal", "published": "2018-05-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lightning-network-cover-1-1024x640.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66722db07e7efa5f34a72d2501f06b9039b238b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jzJlJrCqgiv3waIL2FrF0nxj1T4wNx66SfxIxSCjt6IDG5fkWUroHFv4.2z8efFnsML6jPhp6w7oem6z6qzk53EHmLBawANw0iIXXI2bEH2M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoinist", "published": "2018-05-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal", "text": "Why Lightning Network Will Finally Help Bitcoin Beat Credit Cards, PayPal May 17, 2018 254\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is approaching 2000 functional nodes as users begin to highlight the conspicuous cost savings using the technology.

Questions like, should I invest in Bitcoin? Is cryptocurrency a good idea? Or even, how does it work? dominated conversations on the topic.\nFinancial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands, has focused on a less common point of conversation: The amount of energy Bitcoin uses, a topic he extensively wrote about in a May 16, 2018 article for Joule .\nDe Vries, who spoke to All That’s Interesting said he’s been studying Bitcoin’s energy consumption ever since he “first saw some back-of-the-envelope calculations in 2015.”\nSaid De Vries, “At the time I was surprised nobody was really writing about it.” And since Bitcoin users don’t get to see the energy costs, “I wanted to raise more awareness.”\nHe hopes the paper, which is the first rigorously peer-reviewed article that puts actual numbers to Bitcoin’s energy needs, will get the ball rolling on a legitimate conversation about the energy going into this network and what it means.\n“I’m hoping to really boost the academic discussion with this commentary so that ultimately policy-makers will be able to use it in drafting their response to this fast-growing problem of Bitcoin mining,” explained de Vries.\nBut what exactly is the problem we’re talking about?\nWell, the process of mining Bitcoin is extremely energy-hungry by design. The ultimate goal is to process a financial transaction without a middleman (like a bank). So instead, people all over the world use special software to solve hard cryptographic puzzles to validate others’ transactions and receive Bitcoins in exchange. And solving these puzzles requires the software to try a huge amount of calculations.\nThe main fuel for each of these calculations — electricity. By using an economics-based method, the estimated electricity Bitcoin’s network consumes according to the research is at least 2.55 gigawatts every hour. That’s the same amount of electricity it takes to power Ireland.\nThat number can potentially go up to 7.67 gigawatts by the end of 2018. Which would be half a percent of the entire world’s electric energy.\nJust a single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month.\nThe numbers sound alarming. But environmental issue and blockchain technology are two things many people have a hard time wrapping their heads around.\nSo de Vries helped describe the situation in easy-to-grasp terms.\nThe biggest challenge in explaining it all is that there needs to be a basic understanding that the “energy consumption primarily relates to how agreement on the underlying blockchain is reached.”\nWith mining, reaching that blockchain is, as de Vries put it, “a big competitive lottery.” The miner who wins gets a fixed reward of 12.5 new coins, and this happens every ten minutes as each new block is created.\nBasically, if you’re mining for bitcoin, there’s a big motivation to invest in new machines because the more powerful your computer is, the more likely you are to “get a bigger slice of the pie.” So the incentive to spend more on electricity and machines is there. “The more computational power the more you win.”\nBut even participants who don’t win are expending a lot of power because they are generating numbers the whole time, therefore using just as much electricity.\nThe question remains, who exactly does this concern the most?\nAccording to de Vries, “Ultimately everyone.” There is a lot of energy going into this network, “but there’s also a lot of coal-based electricity,” he said. “That, in turn, has a significant carbon emission factor, and thus impacts our global ability to reach our climate goals.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6"], "entities":

Specifically, one painted in ash. It says that by the end of this year Bitcoin electricity use could triple, approaching the consumption rates of the entire country of Austria.\nWhich, yeah. That’s not good. The conclusion of the peer-reviewed paper, written by Alex de Vries, is brutal.\n“These methods tell us that the Bitcoin network consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity currently, and that it could reach a consumption of 7.67 GW in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 GW) and Austria (8.2 GW),” he writes.\nAnd just in case you were thinking that, well, using only as much electricity as Ireland isn’t too bad, Vries drops another hammer.\n“Additionally, economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter figure,” he notes — with latter in this case being the 8.2 GW. “A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this figure could already be reached in 2018.”\nThis is not the first time we’ve heard wild claims about Bitcoin’s energy consumption . After all, it takes a lot of power to run all those mining rigs. However, Joule is a peer-reviewed publication, which adds weight to Vries’s study.\nImportantly, it’s not like things are great at this moment either. According to Vries, “[the] Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently.”\nBut not everyone buys the doom and gloom. Will Martino, founder of the distributed digital ledger company Kadena , told Mashable that while Vries’s estimates of present Bitcoin electricity consumption look “at least somewhat accurate,” and that “it’s out of control,” he imagines a future that has addressed many of these issues.\n“Over time these things will stabilize,” explained Martino. “I doubt it is going to keep going at that rate.”\nHe went on to add while we should expect Bitcoin energy use to continue to increase in the short term, over the next decade it should eventually come back down.\n“[It’s an] artifact of the stage that we’re at in crypto,” he noted. “[The] longer term is less of a concern because we’ll have greener energy in general.”\nIn other words, there’s still hope that our distributed blockchain-enabled future won’t be a pollution-filled one.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been quoted in the media recently.\nIn their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett's approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has a general distaste for bitcoin.\nFor those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as \"rat poison squared\" at Berkshire Hathaway's 2018 annual shareholder meeting.\nThe Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets One of the key counterarguments to Buffett's assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna.\n\"Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven't taken the time to really understand what's going on here,\" said Wilson. \"If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you'll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn't exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we're going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.\"\nThe LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the \"Web 2.0\" phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed \"Web 3.0.\"\nThis Is Very Different From Buffett's World Wilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett's approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains.\nTalking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them.\n\"The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,\" said Wilson.\nIn short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market.\n\"There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we've ever seen,\" Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem.\nWhile Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved.\nAdditionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:46:28.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e11d489363c57b29d637b53b695db754746b5c17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYArAv7_7lcJokLZ8hBINbNY", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Bitcoin to use 0.5% of world’s electricity by end of 2018", "title_full": "/biz/ - Bitcoin to use 0.5% of world’s electricity by end of 2018 - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-17T20:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e11d489363c57b29d637b53b695db754746b5c17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYArAv7_7lcJokLZ8hBINbNY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-17T20:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin to use 0.5% of world’s electricity by end of 2018", "text": "https://archive.fo/VEALt\nCoincucks will defend this.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://archive.fo/VEALt"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:55:53.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1bc8ee068bd308b0080f2789de6b10f4917ceeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT7Cznq_ndLsMwvXQDWlgbqlbB3SYkAACH8unuU8oXnzMi5DNS5E7EMk-", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "100% Hands Free Bitcoin Income!", "title_full": "100% Hands Free Bitcoin Income!", "published": "2018-05-17T20:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1bc8ee068bd308b0080f2789de6b10f4917ceeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT7Cznq_ndLsMwvXQDWlgbqlbB3SYkAACH8unuU8oXnzMi5DNS5E7EMk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "earn money (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T20:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "100% Hands Free Bitcoin Income!", "text": "This ad is from a PRO or GOLD HERCULIST member.

Photo: Reuters London: Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, currently uses almost as much power as Ireland does, and could be consuming about 0.5% of the world’s total electricity by the end of this year, a study has found.\nBitcoin’s burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency’s wildly fluctuating value. However, estimating exactly how much electricity the bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts—as much as Austria and 0.5% of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. If the price of bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, De Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as “mining” bitcoin.\nHowever, all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power. “You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the bitcoin being mined.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been quoted in the media recently.\nIn their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the “Oracle of Omaha” has a general distaste for bitcoin.\nFor those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as “rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual shareholder meeting. The Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets\nOne of the key counterarguments to Buffett’s assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna.\n“Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven’t taken the time to really understand what’s going on here,” said Wilson. “If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you’ll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn’t exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we’re going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.”\nThe LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the “Web 2.0” phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed “Web 3.0.” This Is Very Different From Buffett’s World\nWilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett’s approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains.\nTalking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them.\n“The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,” said Wilson.\nIn short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market.\n“There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we’ve ever seen,” Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem.\nWhile Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved.\nAdditionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-says-bitcoin-is-probably-rat-poison-squared.html", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fred wil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:34:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2d1b7abdbee33126c2fabe725601981dbabaa67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqafc4VZ6N2VosIumfTFiEo6e2NulH6A1I9JRDo2OmXJd.2e.AhSkgWUP9G57Tx9siZrrx38ids0kixCoPMPsxiqw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Anyone know the real reason why Roger Ver and Bitmain upgraded the block size of Bitcoin Cash to 32 megabytes, I mean no offense, but it had plenty of room at 8 megabytes, so what's the deal?", "title_full": "Anyone know the real reason why Roger Ver and Bitmain upgraded the block size of Bitcoin Cash to 32 megabytes, I mean no offense, but it had plenty of room at 8 megabytes, so what's the deal?

Giải thích cho điều này, Microsoft cho biết tiền mã hóa đôi khi được sử dụng cho những hành vi lừa đảo hoặc phân tán mã độc. Và hãng này muốn giảm thiểu tối đa các rủi ro và bảo vệ khách hàng của mình. \"Chúng tôi luôn đánh giá những chính sách của mình để đảm bảo cung cấp các trải nghiệm an toàn và hấp dẫn cho người dùng Bing và hệ sinh thái quảng cáo kỹ thuật số của chúng tôi. Chưa có những quy định rõ ràng nào với tiền mã hóa cũng như các sản phẩm có liên quan. Chúng tôi thấy được những rủi ro tiềm ẩn mà người dùng phải đối diện trước các hành vi lừa đảo hoặc phân tán mã độc xuất phát từ tiền mã hóa…\", Microsoft cho biết. Microsoft sẽ bắt đầu thực hiện các thay đổi về chính sách sản phẩm và dịch vụ tài chính của Bing trên toàn cầu vào tháng 6 này. Sau đó quá trình triển khai sẽ được thực hiện vào cuối tháng 6 đến đầu tháng 7. Trước đó, Facebook đã chặn các quảng cáo về tiền mã hóa trên nền tảng của mình vào tháng 1/2018. Sau đó 2 tháng, Google cũng có hành động tương tự.

I't perfectly normal to book fractions of cents for small values. Just the exchange is rounded to cents. – Volker Siegel Mar 29 at 13:21 up vote 9 down vote\nTL;DR: If transaction volume explodes, Bitcoin is adopted for micro-payments, and the value of bitcoins increases sufficiently, we will need greater divisibility.\nFirst of all, since there are 100,000,000 satoshi to a bitcoin, obviously one satoshi would be worth $0.01 if one bitcoin were valued at $1 million.\nBeside the questionable math in tysat's answer , his answer is based on the assumption that there are no use-cases for payments smaller than a cent.\nI don't believe that it is a valid assumption to make: Next to there being other currencies with subunits of smaller value than $0.01, when one satoshi is worth $0.01, that would also be the smallest possible transaction fee one could attach! This would be prohibitively expensive for any micro-payment based business scheme, such as for example Bitcoin based content paywalls, direct internet traffic payments to ISPs , or other automated micro-payment driven schemes: Paying five cents to read an article, you'd have to add a 20% fee.\nNow, such services could possibly move off-chain where further precision could be added, yet that would require users to have accounts for each of those services, and to tie up their resources unnecessarily, while reintroducing counter-party risk; essentially reverting a lot of the key selling points of Bitcoin!\nAssuming that the Bitcoin protocol will develop to scale even beyond the transaction capacity of today's credit card systems as recently suggested by Gavin Andresen , it seems plausible that business ideas will appear to challenge even such transaction capacity. As those would though be prohibited by a minimal transaction fee of $0.01, we could see a push towards even smaller fees.\nShould the above lead to a scenario where somebody finds uses for payments with a value of a tenth of a cent ($0.001), and transaction fees for that should be less than 10% of the payment's value, we'd need smaller subunits if one bitcoin becomes more valuable than $10,000. Since we already have breached $1,000 once, that doesn't sound impossible.\nUpdate 2017-03-23: AFAIU, adding further divisibility to Bitcoin would require a hard fork, and therefore is not something that will simply manifest. If necessary, it would require a massive overhaul of all software currently used in the Bitcoin ecosphere. On the other hand, Lightning actually already implemented support for probabilistic sub-satoshi payments.\nUpdate 2018-05-17: Lightning uses millisatoshi to account for channel balances, adding another three magnitudes of precision. Payouts on the blockchain are rounded as the precision there is only to the satoshi.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "– mateen ulhaq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:34:40.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03b4aef91858fb2618ebd07ec3dc0f38e36d3b56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtdUk3dbr4XimE3LjlHpkF2XAQClY6u3u07rXMQBfVNuEZKV1dPtroT0befxiVjDngkIAaxHR7lzI2NvYxKRlCF_9MlJMBzHcY5D__Un3yRQ--", "site_full": "shaul-levi.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://www.shaul-levi.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Shaul Levi", "title": "A Deep Dive in a Real-World Bitcoin Mine - Digiconomist https://t.co/mc5OTJW6Hl via @DigiEconomist", "title_full": "A Deep Dive in a Real-World Bitcoin Mine - Digiconomist https://t.co/mc5OTJW6Hl via @DigiEconomist", "published": "2018-05-17T20:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03b4aef91858fb2618ebd07ec3dc0f38e36d3b56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtdUk3dbr4XimE3LjlHpkF2XAQClY6u3u07rXMQBfVNuEZKV1dPtroT0befxiVjDngkIAaxHR7lzI2NvYxKRlCF_9MlJMBzHcY5D__Un3yRQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Shaul)", "published": "2018-05-17T20:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Deep Dive in a Real-World Bitcoin Mine - Digiconomist https://t.co/mc5OTJW6Hl via @DigiEconomist", "text": "A Deep Dive in a Real-World Bitcoin Mine - Digiconomist https://t.co/mc5OTJW6Hl via @DigiEconomist A Deep Dive in a Real-World Bitcoin Mine - Digiconomist https://t.co/mc5OTJW6Hl via @DigiEconomist — shaul levi (@slevi) May 17, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DigiEconomist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/slevi", "https://twitter.com/slevi/status/997161682848759808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:12:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bac31c28e38d259150e386661356a20e04ce3ea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jLIuPcrMww6WE_81g2aq_WS6.n17RWYpkGHem3jd1gv_tFPm1zt3k_W8e0fe3lzYbZmplIK6vIRL09vLuYRcx9g--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin", "title_full": "Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T20:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Fred_and_Buffet.width-800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bac31c28e38d259150e386661356a20e04ce3ea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jLIuPcrMww6WE_81g2aq_WS6.n17RWYpkGHem3jd1gv_tFPm1zt3k_W8e0fe3lzYbZmplIK6vIRL09vLuYRcx9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Magazine", "published": "2018-05-17T20:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin", "text": "Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin May 17, 2018 51\nYesterday, May 16, 2018, well-known venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan, the latter of which is now the CTO at Coinbase, had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018.

By: PTI | Ahmedabad | Published: May 17, 2018 10:46 PM The case pertains to alleged extortion of the virtual currency worth crores from a Surat-based builder. (Reuters)\nA sessions court here today issued an arrest warrant against former Gujarat BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya in a bitcoin extortion case, in which several police officials have been taken into custody so far. The case pertains to alleged extortion of the virtual currency worth crores from a Surat-based builder. Additional sessions judge P J Tamakuwala allowed the state CID-Crime’s plea for issuance of an arrest warrant under Section 70 of the CrPC. The CID-Crime had issued two summonses against the ex-MLA directing him to appear before it under section 160 of CrPC, but the latter didn’t oblige. The CID-Crime plea had said that Kotadiya has been evading arrest.\nIn its application, moved on May 14, the CID told the court that the former Dhari MLA need to be arrested as he allegedly played a significant role in the crime. Several police officials, including Amreli district superintendent of police Jagdish Patel and an inspector of the local crime branch, were arrested in the case. “Investigations clearly show that Nalin Kotadiya’s name has emerged in the said offences and (he) has played a vital role and was part of a conspiracy and has also received monitory gain,” judge Tamakuwala stated in his order issuing the arrest warrant.\n“There are evidence to substantiate the allegation that Nalin Kotadiya is an accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest. There is sufficient material on record satisfying about the involvement of Kotadiya in the stated non-bailable offences,” the judge noted. The CID told the court that Kotadiya has been untraceable and could not be found by police teams that had visited his residence as well as a place in Amreli district where he was believed to be hiding. Though Kotadiya sent a fax on May 7 stating that he would appear before the investigators on May 12, he did not oblige, the CID told the court. “We have concrete evidence against Kotadiya.\nHe is a highly influential person with a political background. He is not cooperating in the investigation and is hiding which is delaying the investigation. “With a warrant under section 70 of CrPC, CID (Crime) can inform the Gujarat Police and other agencies, and take help of police and investigating agencies from outside the state to find and arrest him,” it said.\nAn FIR was registered against the accused in the case under various sections of the IPC. The case relates to a complaint filed with the CID (Crime) three months back by builder Shailesh Bhatt. Bhatt had alleged that Amreli policemen had kidnapped him, and his business partner Kirit Paladia, from Gandhinagar on February 9 and extorted bitcoins, which was in the possession of Paladia. Bhatt had alleged that Kotadia was also involved in this conspiracy of extorting bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore. Bitcoin is a type of digital money that is issued and normally controlled by its developers and used and accepted among the members of the virtual community. The Centre has said it does not recognise bitcoin or any other crypto-currency as legal tender in India.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j tamakuwala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nalin kotadiya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:16:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "779d522a9f8ebeb6a602057926dfbcdbc8f254ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSjW4Maomu5nTD.W5r2Uq7n1M8AaFrLAye53LsUZKVlJqQoGSEhDNXsqcU0laKBhl4z248XYfS_3wOL4i5ggbmlelx0c8eTsBuispOptdQ_t4GGko.j5tz7Q--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/science/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Science", "title": "Bitcoin estimated to use half a percent of the world's electric energy by end of 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin estimated to use half a percent of the world's electric energy by end of 2018 : science", "published": "2018-05-17T20:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "779d522a9f8ebeb6a602057926dfbcdbc8f254ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSjW4Maomu5nTD.W5r2Uq7n1M8AaFrLAye53LsUZKVlJqQoGSEhDNXsqcU0laKBhl4z248XYfS_3wOL4i5ggbmlelx0c8eTsBuispOptdQ_t4GGko.j5tz7Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nanuk8", "published": "2018-05-17T20:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin estimated to use half a percent of the world's electric energy by end of 2018", "text": "submitted by /u/nanuk8\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:54:39.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c37f3d5872930b7e362448f6b4f74602b31d4857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqadAK2KfLML4eHevSxuDJg.CPkjnfHyo0d8fe1XYf1oeeXlWvlXx4omfcysMiaRRaV", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin IS the killer app.", "title_full": "Bitcoin IS the killer app. : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-17T20:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c37f3d5872930b7e362448f6b4f74602b31d4857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqadAK2KfLML4eHevSxuDJg.CPkjnfHyo0d8fe1XYf1oeeXlWvlXx4omfcysMiaRRaV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rain-is-wet", "published": "2018-05-17T20:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin IS the killer app.", "text": "Firstly, I own some altcoins and I've been in this space since 2013. There wearn't that many alts back then. Dogecoin came around and went mental at the end of 2013, for a while r/dogecoin was looking like overtaking r/Bitcoin ... But slowly people realised that a meme coin is not going to take over the planet, let alone entice Wall St...\nSince then we've had every single application imaginable proposed using blockchain. The vast majority don't even need a blockchain... But everyone's scratching their heads and throwing armfuls of cash at whatever claims to be the 'Killer App' of blockchain.\nWell, here's the thing, (and it's takes a while to sink in, usually a year at least) Bitcoin IS the app. A decentralised, uncensorable, permissionless, digital store of value (which you can build ANY of the alts on top of) IS THE FUCKING APP. It's literally what blockchain was invented for. It's so revolutionary that most miss it at first, looking for something they 'recognise' first. The google or facebook of blockchain... It's missing the point. The ONLY thing you need to run on a blockchain is a token of value.\nThe blockchain must be a good one.\n1) lotsa hashpower.\n2) lotsa nodes\n3) A light weight blocksize so it can be decentralised\n4) really simple programming language (NOT turing complete) so you can't code a fucking virus to tear it apart or hack it to pieces (ethereum et al).\nOnce you have that, a rock solid foundation of TRUST and VALUE that anyone can freely interact with, you can build all sorts of shit on top.\nFor instance, The Lightning Network is just getting started and already there are a wide variety of apps building on it. And if LN doesn't float your boat then Microsoft are building Decntralized ID on top of another Bitcoin layer, Chainpoint. And if you really must have a whole other blockchain then Lightning will have cross atomic swaps to interact with it, or sidechains etc.\nThe point is, you only need Bitcoin, Bitcoin IS the app. It's so new and entirely unlike anything that people at first don't see it. They're blinded by greed. But they eventually always work it out. Look at the smartest people in crypto on twitter, there's a reason they are all bitcoin maximalists. All the new folk from 2017 will come to realise this in 2018.\n submitted by /u/rain-is-wet\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

( SQ ) has seen it shares spike this week on an upbeat note from one team of analysts on the Street who claim that its Cash App is growing faster than PayPal Holding Inc.'s ( PYPL ) peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app Venmo. Bulls at Nomura Instinet expect Square Cash's momentum to persist, attributing part of the strength to the introduction of cryptocurrency trading on its platform. (See also: Square’s Shares to Fall to $30: Short Seller. )\nAccording to a Nomura analysis, since early 2016, Square Cash app downloads have averaged a 128% year-over-year (YOY) growth rate each month, compared to Venmo's 74% average YOY return over the same period. Nomura's Dan Dolev wrote a note to clients Wednesday, indicating that while Venmo has historically seen more downloads than Square, \"the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017.\" Square Cash has been downloaded some 28 million times, just 1 million shy of Venmo's level, according to the analyst.\nAs Square Cash rolls out bitcoin trading in most states, the Nomura analyst wrote that \"its growth versus the popular Coinbase app is noteworthy.\" While Coinbase saw its growth peak in late 2017, in line with bitcoin's all-time highs, its growth has slowed since the holiday period, \"whereas Square Cash App experienced more balanced growth,\" noted Dolev. Square's Cash Attracts Crypto Traders, Unbanked, Underbanked\nDolev expects SQ stock to gain nearly 14% over 12 months to reach $65. Trading up about 0.9% on Thursday morning at $57.09, SQ reflects a 64.7% increase year-to-date (YTD) and a whopping 192.1% surge over 12 months, compared to the S&P 500 's 1.9% return and 15.6% incline over the same respective periods.\nAt the Consensus blockchain conference on Wednesday, Square Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey told attendees that the core demographic for its Cash App has been unbanked and underbanked consumers, as reported by Fast Company. \"It was not a stated goal initially, but it's something we want to lean into,\" said Dorsey, who is also the CEO of social media giant Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ). He indicated that the company is encouraged by its users' growing loyalty to the app, and that the most popular merchants on the platform are Walmart Inc. ( WMT ) and McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ).\n“This is everyday usage,” said Dorsey. “We have evidence to show that people are using this as their primary spending device and primary banking account, and in some cases their only banking account.” (See also: 6 Fast-Growth Stocks That Can Shine. )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shoshanna delventhal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dan dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pypl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal holding inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura instinet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:37:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecc86eb0fe7e2fa9993d01e33fa7d2aa8dc92c89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa9WKlL4iLyLwTQfKm30_xQ.MENkcV_dN4fq1Mt7JxlLMZMrSoMGsCttG3UBQweUs0KcHD2tlAHHBEq0yA1pnY7gGlZ8QLaDX7", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Senior politician and police now implicated in Bitcoin kidnapping/extortion case", "title_full": "Senior politician and police now implicated in Bitcoin kidnapping/extortion case : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-17T20:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecc86eb0fe7e2fa9993d01e33fa7d2aa8dc92c89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa9WKlL4iLyLwTQfKm30_xQ.MENkcV_dN4fq1Mt7JxlLMZMrSoMGsCttG3UBQweUs0KcHD2tlAHHBEq0yA1pnY7gGlZ8QLaDX7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IWriteCrypto", "published": "2018-05-17T20:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Senior politician and police now implicated in Bitcoin kidnapping/extortion case", "text": "submitted by /u/IWriteCrypto\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.chepicap.com/en/news/525/senior-politician-and-police-now-implicated-in-bitcoin-kidnapping-extortion-case.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:11:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bba882929e8d60774d329453a6e94e12eb229c51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkUUn0mIiq9bhlPWGjLQnbtVBs3WSnYuqrd1fRNPBgOMYmCc8QP3RlLhrFUPmbbDRvB6eY_ehp174-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "3 Reasons Why Bitcoin IRAs Are a Smart Retirement Strategy", "title_full": "3 Reasons Why Bitcoin IRAs Are a Smart Retirement Strategy", "published": "2018-05-17T19:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1rPYc8edRLKilnJMlCpZzA--~B/aD00MjU7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/bc66d5513566b1f71fc32edbfcc05d6c", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bba882929e8d60774d329453a6e94e12eb229c51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkUUn0mIiq9bhlPWGjLQnbtVBs3WSnYuqrd1fRNPBgOMYmCc8QP3RlLhrFUPmbbDRvB6eY_ehp174-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chris Kline", "published": "2018-05-17T19:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Reasons Why Bitcoin IRAs Are a Smart Retirement Strategy", "text": "Everywhere you turn, and even across political parties, the sentiment about retirement in America seems to share a rather uniform view: it’s bleak. According to a study published in 2017 by the National Institute of Retirement Security, 88% of Americans say that the nation faces a retirement crisis. When you get more specific, the statistics get even scarier: 21% of all Americans have $0 saved for retirement, and, if you’re looking at the millennial sector of Americans aged 21-32, that number climbs up to 66%. Above all else, there seems to be a general sense of confusion: 81% of Americans have no idea how much money they’ll need for retirement. So, is the notion of retiring beachside with a margarita a thing of the past? Not necessarily. But now is certainly time to rethink strategy. And one of the crucial and often overlooked factors in a successful retirement portfolio? Diversification. “For a variety of reasons, people do not understand the value of having a highly diversified portfolio,” writes Barry Ritholtz in Bloomberg’s recent article “ How to Avoid a Retirement Disaster .”\nSome workers fear that investing in other stocks and assets will reveal a lack of corporate loyalty, while others, driven by wishful thinking, invest solely in their company’s stocks in the hopes that it will become the next Amazon, Apple, or Google. But, as Ritholtz explains, “That is a very intense concentration of financial risk. For those workers, diversifying their company stock into broad indexes is a prudent approach.”\nFurthermore, it is also important to diversify across asset classes . Different assets, such as stocks and bonds, will not react in the same way to negative events, and a combination of assets is the best safeguard against a portfolio’s sensitivity to market swings.\nAs the COO of BitcoinIRA.com , the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency retirement platform, I talk to customers every day about how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, removed from third-party interference and stock market fluctuations, can function as a valuable asset class in a successfully diversified retirement portfolio. Here are a few reasons why.\nA Rising Star in Wall Street Circles According to CoinDesk’s comprehensive State of the Blockchain report for Q1 2018, 69% of people surveyed think that Bitcoin’s prices at the end of Q1 2017 are undervalued, indicating that the Bitcoin’s star is rising. This sentiment is largely reflected by the surge of mainstream acceptance that cryptocurrencies are seeing, particularly in the Wall Street domain.\nThe CME and Cboe were the first two institutions to launch regulated Bitcoin futures in 2017, serving as trailblazers for larger adoption in the mainstream finance world.\nSince then, Goldman Sachs announced the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank, while Nasdaq has announced a collaboration with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini , and confirmed their interest in eventually becoming a crypto exchange as well.\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs alumnus, and billionaire cryptocurrency advocate Mike Novogratz just announced a partnership with Bloomberg to launch the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index , which will track the performance of the ten most liquid cryptocurrencies. “This is just one more building block in the foundation that will get, at one point, pension funds and family offices and sovereign wealth funds all participating in the crypto economy.”\nI believe that this shift towards mainstream acceptance indicates Bitcoin’s staying power as a viable long-term asset class for a diversified retirement portfolio.\nA Complement to Gold Gold has been around for thousands of years, and its finite supply, as well its removal from the stock market, has helped earn its reputation as a notoriously reliable investment as well as a valuable hedge against inflation.\nWhile Bitcoin has only been on the scene since 2009, it has already demonstrated similar merits. According to research published by ArkInvest and Coinbase , Bitcoin has already been recognized as “the only asset that maintains consistently low correlation with every other asset,” demonstrating its strength as a diversified asset in a retirement portfolio.\nSuggested Articles\nBitcoin’s Lightning Network: How Can it Solve Bitcoin’s Biggest Problem How Bitcoin Can Destroy the World. Completely! The Next Cryptocurrency Evolution: Countries Issue their Own Cryptocurrency A Groundbreaking Technology Industries across a variety of sectors are recognizing that the decentralized blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin has major applications in a variety of enterprises. The decentralized blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin is already the way that many industries run the business. Facebook recently announced the launch of a blockchain research team, with interest in the technology’s application to such fields as data storage .\nStory Continues Amazon , too, just announced a partnership with a new start-up called Kaleido that makes it easier for customers to put their services on a blockchain. “Introducing Klaido to Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers is going to help customers move faster and not worry about managing blockchain themselves,” Amazon Web Services said in a statement, adding that it is the first Blockchain SaaS solution available on the AWS marketplace.\nIn my opinion, Bitcoin’s influence in the mainstream finance and technology sector is more powerful than ever. A distinguished asset alongside gold, I believe that Bitcoin will continue to prove itself as a valuable digital asset in a diversified retirement portfolio.\nThis article was written By Chris Kline,

Times of India", "text": "LONDON: The Bitcoin network - one of the most popular cryptocurrencies - currently uses almost as much power as Ireland does, and could be consuming about 0.5 per cent of the world's total electricity by the end of this year, a study has found.\nBitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency 's wildly fluctuating value. However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries , who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts - as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five per cent of the world's electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins - a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "india london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:10:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4eb2ecc02d8c1e36dce900e436fcbe835e08c6f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Z3EOfkyq6OFra2Q9vYMrLSzZs2MupjSww1adI6e_g4A8JflGhCsc53Rjy0V7VTas-", "site_full": "www.myza.co.za", "site": "myza.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.myza.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "MyZA", "title": "Learning About Bitcoin-Part 3", "title_full": "Learning About Bitcoin-Part 3", "published": "2018-05-17T19:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4eb2ecc02d8c1e36dce900e436fcbe835e08c6f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Z3EOfkyq6OFra2Q9vYMrLSzZs2MupjSww1adI6e_g4A8JflGhCsc53Rjy0V7VTas-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan", "published": "2018-05-17T19:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Learning About Bitcoin-Part 3", "text": "Learning About Bitcoin-Part 3 :\nIf you want to purchase Bitcoin as an investment and you want to join the BitClub Network Company, so that BitClub can mine Bitcoin and other Crypto Currency on your behalf to grow a stable and increasing investment for you, please join BitClub for free at http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn .

Set up the software by linking it to your worker created in Step 7. “Click Settings”>“Account…”. Beside “User Name:” use the username you created when creating the BitMinter account. Beside “Worker Name:” and “Worker Password:” enter the worker name and worker password you created in Step 6. If the window is small, click the button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then click the “Engine Start” button beside each of the devices you want to use. For reference, I get about 65 Mhps (million hashes per second). 1000 Khps = 1 Mhps. Test all of your devices, but you should really only bother running devices that get you 25 Mhps or above. You will also want to change a few settings regarding automation. I leave my computer on all day and all night. I normally turn off the mining as soon as I get home from work (around 6:00) and have the miner start on its own at night in case I forget to start it when I’m done with my computer. Go to Settings > Options to change these settings. Look at the fourth picture to set it up like how I have it set up. The picture has explanations.\nAutomated devices are a list of devices that you set so that you can start them on their own automatically when the software starts. I have selected one of my devices as automated so that when the software starts, only that device starts. See fourth picture for more details. Step 9: Mine. Let your computer run while it mines! Running it at night is a good idea as it will double the amount of money you make. Good luck making money. Step 10: Spend Your Bitcoins. What good is a currency if you can’t spend it? The answer is it’s not. There are lots of things you can do. Below is a list: Gamble. SatoshiDice. Bitzino. Peerbet. RoyalBitcoin. Buy various merchandise. Some online vendors are starting to accept bitcoins s a way of purchasing items. Buy Coffee at http://bitcoincoffee.com/. Trade it for PayPal money. Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange. The last one I want to talk about it Mt. Gox. It is the most common website used to trade (buy or sell) bitcoins for dollars or any other national currency. You can receive this money through PayPal or many other online currency transfer services. I am not going to go through the details of this, but to send bitcoins to anyone or any service, follow the instructions in the next step.\nStep 11: Send Bitcoins to Someone. To use bitcoins, you must send bitcoins to another address. To send bitcoins, the service will give you a specific address to send bitcoins to. Copy this address. Open up your bitcoin wallet. Click on the “Send coins” tab. Enter the address you want to send the coins to in the “Pay to” field. If you are going to send coins to this person or group multiple times, you can enter a label for this person so that you can find them in your address book again. Enter the amount in the next field (for easy math, remember that 1 BTC is $ 10). Click send when you are done. If you just want to practice sending bitcoins to someone, you can test sending them to me. Just send 0.01 BTC to me (approx. 10 cents). Good luck. Step 12: Done. And that is just about all the basic information about bitcoins. If you have any questions, or there is something really obvious and important that I had missed, drop me a comment. I’ll try to respond as quickly as possible. If you want to donate, send me a bitcoin or two at 16bVf7XX3dKN2zW6ut8FRSQaGZZBHAFYZt.
