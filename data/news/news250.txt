Seriously, for the first 5-8 years, the digital currency was mainly used as a means for criminals to launder money and sell illegal goods on the dark market. Think of all the massive hacks in the early days also, and all those darknet markets that disappeared with huge amounts of bitcoin.\nLiterally millions and millions of the 16 million coins out there would be owned by criminals. And now with bitcoin becoming more centralized and less anonymous, they are swiftly exiting the market and looking for alternative dark coins.\nI also personally avoid using bitcoin all-together because of the extremely slow transaction speeds and high cost's associated with it.\nThe bitcoin mining business is dust, so that interest will die quickly.\nI just don't see a very bright future for the god of cryptocurrency and it will surely be surpassed by one of its rivals soon enough.\nI'm torn between predicting it to be Dash, or Ethereum, and I recon it could be about 2 years before that happens.\nWould love to know peoples thoughts on the future of bitcoin.\nWhere will bitcoin be in\n2 weeks?\n2 months?\n2 years?\nWill it be surpassed by another coin? If so, which one and when?\nWe can't be sure what thebfuture stare of bitcoin or any otger ceypyocurrency available in the market will be.

The process and methods involved are too complex, not to mention the hardware, the space (with the right temperature), and the initial investment needed are too costly. The number of miners have been decreasing over the past years since they have been shifting into a new alternative rather than mining.

The decline follows weeks of gains caused by excitement that American buyers would invest in bitcoin after the US tax season came to an end.\nToday’s decline comes as the crypto industry holds one of its biggest events in New York. Consensus 2018 –a three-day conference which features a wide range of cryptocurrency talks and exhibitions – recorded its biggest attendance in history with more than 4000 people paying the $2000 entry fee. Attendees included James Bullard, the President and CEO of St. Louis Fed and Jeremy Alliare, the CEO of Circle.\nOne of the biggest announcements at the event came from Circle who revealed plans to launch a new fiat-backed currency pegged on the dollar. The stable ‘US dollar coin’ could be a game changer in the blockchain industry helping to solve the problem of volatility. This is currently one of the biggest crypto issues because businesses are afraid to accept a currency that could fall in value within minutes. Circle is currently valued at more than $3 billion. - advertisement -\nBitcoin is currently trading at $8145. It is trading below the 30 and 60-day moving averages with the MACD showing signs of a shorter downside. Using the hourly chart, the pair’s RSI is at 30, headed higher. It is likely that the pair will continue moving lower but, traders need to be careful going short because a reversal might be on the horizon.

Hileman wrote and teaches the University of Cambridge's first blockchain and cryptocurrency course. Hileman will be Blockchain's head of research, looking at things like usage, geographical spread, and new areas such as stable coins. Hileman talked to Business Insider about why he believes cryptocurrencies are here to stay, what he teaches at Cambridge, why skeptical economists like Paul Krugman and Nouriel Roubini are wrong, and more.\nLONDON — Hot cryptocurrency company Blockchain has hired academic Dr. Garrick Hileman as its first head of research.\nHileman has been studying cryptocurrencies since 2011 and holds posts at both the University of Cambridge and the London School of Economics. He developed the first course on cryptocurrencies at Cambridge and still teaches it at the University's Judge Business School.\nHileman is also well respected in the crypto community, having been an early employee of sector news website CoinDesk. In that role, he created and authored the State of Bitcoin and State of Blockchain reports between 2013 and 2016.\nBlockchain is the world's biggest cryptocurrency-wallet provider, with over 24 million of its wallets in use across 140 countries. The London-headquartered company is also working behind the scenes to build crypto-inspired products and services for mainstream finance. Blockchain recently hired former Goldman banker Breanne Madigan to lead Institutional Sales and Strategy.\nBusiness Insider jumped on the phone with Hileman to hear about how he got into crypto, why he's bullish on the technology while other economists are sceptical, and what he'll be doing at Blockchain. 'I felt very comfortable pivoting my career'\nBlockchain CEO Peter Smith. Blockchain\nHileman first discovered cryptocurrencies when he was doing his PhD at the London School of Economics in 2011. His thesis was on currency black markets and he heard about bitcoin, which at the time was largely being used to power the online black market Silk Road.\n\"It grabbed my attention and I thought, what is this thing?\" Hileman told BI. \"That was one of my first papers, looking at the taxonomy of cryptocurrencies.\"\nThe more he looked into the space, the more intrigued he became.\n\"It's a very multidisciplinary subject so I think the complexity of it is very appealing to me,\" he said. \"Someone like myself who's worked in technology, worked in finance, studied economics, studied history, has an interest in policy questions — it really ticks a lot of boxes for me personally.\"\nHileman had spent more than a decade working for companies like Bank of America, The Home Depot, IDG, and Allianz before going back to academia.\n\"To me, it made sense that this was going to become something important and more significant over time so I felt very comfortable early on devoting significant time and really pivoting my career,\" he said. 'Many economists have a hard time seeing the technology'\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini is a bitcoin skeptic. Screenshot via Bloomberg TV\nHileman's views on crypto make \"unusual as an academic based economist,\" he admits.\n\"Many of my peers in academia have not been as enthusiastic about cryptocurrency or as open to the success its enjoyed and its growing importance.\"\nPaul Krugman has called bitcoin \"evil\" and \"an obvious bubble.\" Tyler Cowen describes himself as a \"blockchain skeptic.\" And Nouriel Roubini, the economist credited with predicting the 2008 housing bubble, recently called bitcoin \"bulls---.\"\n\"It seemed like it was underestimated by a lot of people,\" Hileman said. \"Nouriel Roubini of course of late has been making a lot of noise but he's one of many — Paul Krugman, Tyler Cowen, Brad DeLong and others — who have really bashed bitcoin for many years now.\n\"It's been actually pretty surprising for me to learn that many economists have a hard time seeing the technology. The use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is really a technology platform and not just a currency, not just a return to the gold standard or something.\n\"Some of them don't have the best track record for understanding technology, to be frank. Paul Krugman famously thought the internet wasn't all that more significant than a fax machine . I'm not sure I would have a lot of success helping them understand the significance of this technology as a new platform, as something that in some ways can be compared to the internet.\" 'Crypto years are kind of like dog years'\nDr Garrick Hileman. Blockchain\nIn his Cambridge course, which he will continue to teach while at Blockchain, Hileman teaches the history of cryptocurrencies, the definition of money, the definition of blockchain, use cases for both, smart contracts, and adoption of the technology.\n\"I think it's very difficult to understand what bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are if you don't first understand what money is,\" he said.\n\"It's been an eye-opener to me and many people who've been educating people about cryptocurrencies to learn how little people know about money — even people in finance and very, very smart people don't know for example that the vast majority of our money is made through the process of lending by banks, privately owned institutions. Very few people when I ask for a show of hands know that the coins and notes in our pockets represent 5-10% of the money supply.\"\nAs for bitcoin, Hileman says he does not believe it counts as money: \"It falls down as a widely used unit of account. It's a store of value, it's a means of exchange, but it's not a unit of account.\"\nWhile Hileman is confident of the significance of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, he is not comfortable making predictions about how the space will evolve.\n\"Crypto years are kind of like dog years,\" he said. \"You pack 6, 7 years worth of time into a single year it seems. I personally am not making any 5 to 10-year projections.\" A 'kid in a candy store'\nHileman said he feels like a \"kid in a candy store\" in his new role at Blockchain.\n\"Blockchain is one of the premier data organizations in the crypto space and has been a big supporter of my research in the past,\" he said.\n\"I'm going to be first and foremost really looking to better understand the data landscape both in terms of Blockchain as a company as well as across the space.\n\"There's a lot of things we still don't understand — where people who are using cryptocurrency, for example, are based primarily? How is cryptocurrency being used? Which cryptocurrencies are gaining more fundamental traction? I think a lot of work still needs to be done just on the empirical side.\"\nBlockchain's CEO and cofounder Peter Smith said in a statement that Hileman's role will be to \"not only help to advance our company but the industry at large with his work.\"\nHileman added: \"Other areas I'll be looking at early on are things like stable coins, which I think are a very interesting innovation. These are cryptocurrencies that are designed to be stable in value relative to things like the US dollar and may solve some of the volatility problems that many cryptocurrencies have and serve as a deterrent to payments.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://nypost.com/2018/05/02/nouriel-roubini-says-bitcoin-is-bulls-t/", "https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/bitcoin-is-evil/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/video/roubini-ukraine-could-tip-europe-back-to-recession-NjbbICk3T6K0fAQOSzbRCg.html", "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-27/blockchains-warrant-skepticism-but-keep-an-open-mind?utm_content=crypto&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul krugman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "garrick hileman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hileman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london school of economics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judge business school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T09:03:35.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fd8ea25f7c274f3b259eeb1c5f3b822f00fe0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pDj_zo7E0iiCodFizA1VcAEdOuoSnOkKm", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/g/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/g/ - Technology - 4chan", "title": "What's the best site for buying bitcoin?

Posted By: MrTopStep May 16, 2018\nWith the Consensus conference taking place in New York this week, we’re featuring conversations around cryptocurrency. From Bitcoin to Ether and lots of others, where are cryptos headed and what do they mean for market participants and global economics? This is part two of our conversation with Don Wilson, founder of DRW .\nWilson told a Chicago event in February that cryptocurrencies would “change the world.” But go back a few years and Wilson told us his firm had an internal debate about why Bitcoin was important. One side suggested the underlying technology was what mattered, while another stated that moving value in a frictionless manner was what is important.\nOn the latter point of view, he told us in late 2017, “It’s really the network effect that creates the value. And since Bitcoin is the first mover in that space, the first instrument to leverage that technology, then Bitcoin is the important thing.”\nIt’s insight into the thinking that led to Cumberland , a unit of DRW focused exclusively on cryptocurrency that launched in 2014. The firm was an early entrant into the Bitcoin space and has since expanded into dozens of other cryptocurrencies.\nThough Cumberland has firmly established itself as a force in crypto markets, the debate over blockchain vs. bitcoin as the more meaningful technology goes on, as seen on stage at Consensus this week.\nWatch Wilson’s remarks in the video above.

Recent activity on the United States’ east coast also shows that hype surrounding digital currency and blockchain technology hasn’t died down, despite price dips and market volatility.\nBitcoin (BTC)\nThe father of cryptocurrencies is swiftly rising through the ranks and sits at $8,200 at press time. In just the last four days, the currency has spiked tremendously following a huge Thursday drop to $8,250 – the lowest it’s been since early April – from last weekend’s trading high of $9,800. Bitcoin is down 5.77% over the past 24 hours.\nOne of the reasons for Monday’s spike may be the Coindesk Consensus Conference, which is a three-day event that began in New York on the morning of Monday, May 14. The event’s organizers expect to see over 8,500 visitors and are selling tickets for over $2,000 each. Overall, organizers are expecting revenue of roughly $17 million this year from ticket sales alone.\n“It’s a bit chaotic here,” said Ronnie Moas, Conference attendee and head of the independent market research firm Standpoint Research. “I think they sold too many tickets.”\nReports have emerged that the line for entry saw attendees occupying both the lobby and second floor of the hotel where the Conference was taking place.\n“I’ve never seen anything like this for registration,” says Jeff Denton, senior director of global secure supply chain at AmerisourceBergen in Philadelphia. Denton says he waited for over an hour to gain entry to the event. “It’s expensive, but it’s the largest conference in the U.S., so hopefully that brings the value for the cost.”\nEthereum (ETH)\nSince our last price piece, ETH has experienced a price dip and is now trading for $686.90 – about the same from where it previously stood. Ethereum is down 5.77% over the past 24 hours.\nThe Ethereum Ethereal Summit took place on May 11 and 12 as part of the state’s ongoing “Blockchain Week.” The two-day event saw several speakers, business owners and blockchain experts joining together to offer attendees information regarding the powers behind the blockchain and how it can assist in the decentralization of modern society.\nThe high attendance marks for both the Consensus and Ethereum events suggest that investor interest in cryptocurrency remains high despite ongoing volatility.\nRipple (XRP)\nAt press time, XRP is trading for 67 cents. This is about two cents lower than where the currency sat during our last price discussion. Ripple is down 8.46% over the past 24 hours.\nFor the most part, big things appear to be happening for Ripple. The company recently announced its new “Xpring” initiative, in which executives are targeting entrepreneurs and startup ventures to build partnerships and expand the XRP ecosystem.\nAccording to TechCrunch, the project will be a mixture of “investments, grants and incubation to lure companies and expand the use of XRP whilst allowing Ripple to focus on its financial services business.”\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\nBitcoin Cash has witnessed a solid drop in its price since our last article. Previously trading at just over $1,400, the currency is now trading for about $1,253.86. Bitcoin Cash is down 11.78% over the past 24 hours.\nOn Monday, the Winklevoss Twins announced they were adding Bitcoin Cash to their New York-based cryptocurrency platform Gemini Exchange.\nWhile trading details (i.e. when the currency will be officially added) have not yet been released, the company has also stated that it will enable Zcash deposits beginning on May 19, making Gemini the first official Zcash trading platform in the U.S.\nLitecoin (LTC)\nLitecoin is trading for about $136. This marks a four-dollar decrease since our previous price piece. Litecoin is down 6.51% over the past 24 hours\nLitecoin will be joining Bitcoin Cash on the Gemini Exchange, and while details are scarce for now, the news may have instigated the currency’s\ntemporary rise beyond the $145 mark. CryptoSlate will bring you more on this story as it develops.\nMarket Summary\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap sits at $374 billion, roughly $12 billion lower than where it stood during our previous article.\nWhile the market is showing signs of recovery, investors are warned that the volatility of the industry remains serious and that cryptocurrency figures are never “set in stone.” Thus, they should always remain cautious during trades, and only invest what they can afford to part with.\nPosted\n#litecoin bitclub network bitcoin bitcoin cash ethereum ripple Post navigation Hello, my name is Alan Zibluk.

A major advantage over the greenback has been stressed the ease of transaction and trade facilitation seen by Bitcoin so far. On the other hand, the dollar has always had the solid support of the largest economy in the world, the United States. There are pros and cons to both forms of exchange. The question is which one would receive higher support and trust from the financial sector and people.\nJapan\nJPY, 00:50 a.m. GMT + 1 GDP (QoQ) (Q1) P – GDP measures the change in the total production of goods and services for the first quarter of 2018. Market analyst expectations show a decrease in gross domestic product at 0.0% compared to 0.4% that came in for the last quarter of 2017. If the actual performance is higher than projected, this should be read as a bullish sign. Inversely, a considerable slowdown should be seen as bearish for the Japanese yen.\nEuropean Union\nEUR, 10:00 a.m. GMT, ECB President Draghi Speaks – the president of the European Central Bank has the power and influence to set short-term interest rates. Interest rates, as you know, are a direct reflection of the state of the economy. A stronger (i.e. higher rate) suggests a stronger currency. And vice versa, lower rates (or even negative ones) should be seen as having a negative impact on the common Euro Zone currency.\nThe United States\nUSD, 13:30 p.m. GMT, Building Permits (Apr) – a key indicator of demand in the housing sector, Building Permits measures the change in the number of permits issued by the government for the month of April. Forecast suggests a decrease in the number of permits at 1.350M compared to 1.379M for the month of February. If the event is reported to miss expectations and permits have gone down even lower, this should be read as a bearish sign for the dollar. A much stronger result, on the other hand, is to be read as a positive factor for the dollar.\nOIL\nUSD, 15:30 p.m. GMT, Crude Oil Inventories – WTI now trades above $70 for a barrel of crude oil. Prices have been accelerating and they’ve been accelerating fast. Analyst forecast for the change in the level of inventories shows an expected increase at -1.467M compared to the reading report which came out the week before at -2.197M. The higher the level of inventories, the larger the supply and consequently the prices should go lower as the value of oil would drop due to an oversupply. If, however, there is a large cut to oil production, this should send prices surging higher (as supply would be scarce and demand a lot higher).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T12:39:08.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98027e3b23f18fb961434893d7cf6c482a202754", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.soLJeH2axJvOaZ8OL1Myhxk9lg5aDbII9Dyg2DWI.HWnqo9Ex0VHjViz72PKLdLKZQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "The Zurich bakery where you can't pay with cash (but bitcoins are fine)", "title_full": "The Zurich bakery where you can't pay with cash (but bitcoins are fine)", "published": "2018-05-16T08:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98027e3b23f18fb961434893d7cf6c482a202754", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.soLJeH2axJvOaZ8OL1Myhxk9lg5aDbII9Dyg2DWI.HWnqo9Ex0VHjViz72PKLdLKZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T08:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Zurich bakery where you can't pay with cash (but bitcoins are fine)", "text": "The Zurich bakery where you can't pay with cash (but bitcoins are fine)\n/u/zappadoing\nsubmitted by /u/zappadoing\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "zurich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T08:57:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4af60d54b3b438bb781f6a278a41cdd6193616c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzBZNWURm81jHCkd4pUVWJgYU2waov4JBbONLvbZ2OKR9WqmHFwfTWTdSr64F6_99BFhME3f7NUP_43NCIrU3qjbrxYMY40G7dHOEQrROhyKPQdEu8z5nv", "site_full": "laonikos13galanis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://laonikos13galanis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "akeratos of Delphi", "title": "Consensus 2018: What You've Missed So Far From The Biggest Bitcoin Event", "title_full": "Consensus 2018: What You've Missed So Far From The Biggest Bitcoin Event", "published": "2018-05-16T08:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4af60d54b3b438bb781f6a278a41cdd6193616c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzBZNWURm81jHCkd4pUVWJgYU2waov4JBbONLvbZ2OKR9WqmHFwfTWTdSr64F6_99BFhME3f7NUP_43NCIrU3qjbrxYMY40G7dHOEQrROhyKPQdEu8z5nv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nikos Galanis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T08:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Consensus 2018: What You've Missed So Far From The Biggest Bitcoin Event", "text": "\n Billy Bambrough , CONTRIBUTOR I write about how bitcoin, crypto, and fintech are changing the world. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.\nNEW YORK, NY - MAY 14: Ripio CEO Sebastian Serrano speaks during Consensus 2018 at the The New York Hilton Midtown on May 14, 2018 in New York City. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images) Consensus 2018 in New York is well underway but far from done! Here's a run down of everything you've missed so far from the biggest yearly event in Bitcoin. A ticket for CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference will set you back roughly $2,000 per ticket and with 8,500 attendees the event will be bringing in $17 million in ticket sales alone this year.\nLast-minute admission is an eye-watering $3,000 per person (about 0.3 Bitcoin for those that no longer think in dollars).\nConsensus, a three-day conference which features talks and exhibitions on everything cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and the underlying blockchain, is this year the biggest yet -- and the first since Bitcoin's price explosion last year that saw Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocket in price.\nThe Bitcoin price has already rallied since the biggest hitters from the world of cryptocurrency descended on New York over the weekend, adding some 4% from a three-week low on Monday.\n Consensus 2018: Who's there...\nPretty much everyone who's anyone in the cryptocurrency space, from startups, to investors, and the established financial sector, is in New York for Consensus this week.\nOrganiser CoinDesk has had to apologise for the long waits, with one CNBC reporter reportedly having to wait over an hour to pick up their entrance badge.\n Jacob Donnelly, director of marketing at CoinDesk, said: \"Whilst we apologise for any delays, Consensus 2018 has received overwhelming interest and is the largest blockchain-focused event ever held in the United States. We are working to reduce the wait time.\"\nIt's not just Consensus which is bringing the crowds of course, with this week the first Blockchain Week New York . A full week of some 20 blockchain related events, some of which carry similar ticket prices, are scheduled around Consensus.\nMeanwhile, the lambos were out in force to welcome attendees to the New York Hilton Midtown as the newly minted Bitcoin wealthy flashed the digital cash.\nArthur Hayes, CEO of Bitmex, arrived at Consensus 2018 in a Lamborghini\nBruce Pon, founder of Ocean Protocol, was spotting Lambos at the Consensus 2018 entrance Consensus 2018: .. . And who's not there\nVitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, is one high profile cryptocurreny personality eschewing the fourth annual Consensus event this year.\nButerin slammed the high ticket prices ahead of the event, saying: \"I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent-seeking.\"\nHe also criticised organiser CoinDesk's reporting policies and use of off the record quotes, saying via Twitter : \"[CoinDesk's] reporting policies are designed to trap you with gotchas. Did you know that if you send them a reply, and you explicitly say that some part is off the record, that's explicitly on the record unless you go through a request/approve dance first?\"\nConsensus 2018: FedEx CEO calls blockchain the next \"big disruption\"\nFred Smith, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. logistic giant FedEx, yesterday said : \"Blockchain has the potential to completely revolutionize what's across the border.\"\nLogistics is thought to be one of the industries that blockchain tech could be most effective in, with increased efficiency and transparency improving the system from warehousing, to delivery, to payment.\nSmith has previously signalled his interest in blockchain, with FedEx joining the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) earlier this year .\nAccording to Smith, countries' different standards, regulations and terminologies cause a \"massive amount of friction\" in cross-border logistics and blockchain's \"chain of custody\" might be able to help.\nConsensus 2018: Bullard isn't so bullish on Bitcoin\nSt. Louis Federal reserve president James Bullard yesterday warned that instability in exchange rates is the biggest obstacle to widespread cryptocurrency adoption.\nThat volatility has seen the Bitcoin price climb to almost $20,000 per coin late last year before more than halving just a couple of months later.\nBullard told the Consensus audience:\nYou've got this kind of special problem of who's going to issue the currency and what are those promises about future issuance and can you really maintain the credibility of those promises. If you can't, the value of your currency is going to zero the same way the Venezuelan bolivar has. Bullard also played down the possibility the U.S. Fed will introduce its own digital currency.\nConsensus 2018: Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song made a bet about the future of blockchain tech\n Jimmy Song, a partner at Blockchain Capital, and Joe Lubin, the founder of the Ethereum startup studio Consensys (not to be confused with this event), took part in a fiery on stage debate yesterday which ended in a bet over the future of blockchain tech.\nSong, sceptical about the potential benefits of many of the blockchain applications paraded at Consensus, said they all sound to him like \"magical blockchain dust\".\nSong said: \"I don't really see much of this stuff gaining much traction. Bitcoin is the real innovation here.\"\n Lubin went to bat for blockchain, challenging Song: \"I'll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong.\"\nThe details of the bet -- which the pair shook on -- are still to be worked out, it seems, but Song should probably note that Lubin is worth between $1 billion and $5 billion, according to Forbes .\nConsensus 2018: Former JPMorgan Chase bankers are starting over\nAmber Baldet and Patrick Mylund Nielsen, two former JPMorgan Chase bankers, announced their latest venture: Clovyr, billed as a \"pragmatic connection between enterprise and public chains\".\nLubin and Song's bet was made as a direct result of Baldet's Clovyr demo, which must have been awkward.\nBaldet, the former head of blockchain projects at the US bank, told Fortune Clovyr will act as something of an app store for decentralised apps and services.\nClovyr is currently raising funds from investors.

In the list, it should have a single transaction of 0.00001 bitcoins (approx…This value goes up and down). You now have gained a small amount of bitcoins. The general conversion of bitcoins to USD is times 10, meaning that one bitcoins is ten US dollars (easy for mental math; this number varies greatly over time). Congrats! You just made one tenth of a cent! This is a valid way to gain money. However, you can only get coins sent once every hour, so it is very slow. You won’t make any money fast with this method. Step 4: Understanding the Types of Mining. Now that we understand what bitcoins are, have a wallet set up to store them, and have made a small amount of bitcoins to test our wallet, we’re set to start making some real amounts of bitcoins. The way we do this is by mining for them. Mining, as stated before, is a way of verifying bitcoin transactions made by other people in return for new bitcoins (given right to your wallet). There are two main types of mining: solo and pool. Solo mining is done on your own. With the hardware of an everyday person, it would take years to get earn actual bitcoins. But once you succeed, you get 50 bitcoins (worth about 500 US dollars). This takes too long, so in this Instructable, we are not going to cover this method. The method we are going to use is called pool mining. It involves signing up for an account with any one of many different companies.\nUsing their own software and hardware, they group together the mining efforts of lots of people’s computers. Every person gets a small number of bitcoins (quite often decimals of a bitcoin). As a person with a modest computer, this is the only way to go. Step 5: Setting Up a Mining Account. After trying a few different mining pools, the one that I really liked was BitMinter. It is, by far, the easiest to use. It comes with its own software, making things so much easier. Below are the few parts that involve the creation and setup of your account. 1) Open up a web browser and navigate to the BitMinter log in ( https://bitminter.com/login ). 2) Choose your account you’d like to link with BitMinter. Log in with this account. BitMinter uses a log in service called OpenID, which is a futuristic way of logging in with an already-existing account to eliminate the need to remember yet another password. 3) Set the main settings as according to the picture: Set your email address. Set your auto cash out threshold to a reasonable amount. Mine is set to 1 BTC (approx. $10). This means that when I mine 1 BTC, I will receive it into my bitcoin wallet, just like the test, but with a higher number of bitcoins. Set your “Pay to address” to the address that we used in the Step 3 to test the wallet. This is the address that all of your bitcoins are sent to, in case you haven’t figured that out yet.\nStep 6: Setting Up the Workers. Each computer needs its own worker to connect to on the BitMinter server. The software (in the next step) on each computer will each be set up to a different worker so that the BitMinter server doesn’t have trouble transmitting and receiving mining work. While still logged into the BitMinter website, hover over “My Account” at the top of the page. Then click on “Workers”.Near the bottom of the page, there are two fields under the “Name” and “Password” headers. Give your new worker a name like “Laptop”, or “New Dell”. Create a short password. Remember the password for the worker. Then click “Add”. Click “Home” in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Step 7: Install Java. Most people already have Java installed, but if you don’t, follow this step. 1) Go to http://www.java.com/download . 2) Click “Free Java Download”. 3) Click “Agree and Start Free Download”. 4) Depending on your operating system, a different version of the file will download. 5) Follow the onscreen instructions to continue installing the software. 6) Click finish and be done installing. Continue on to the next step to set up a miner. Step 8: Set Up a Miner. Go back to the BitMinter homepage at http://bitminter.com/ . Click on the “Engine Start” button. This will download a Java Web Starter, which will download the actual program and install it. Use this file to start the program in the future.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T08:42:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8f74457d41a58b9b7a2557dead2eb9773d17504", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5qj82kJRG0slCShcj4giBDuJYmzCwHQSnst7dZ29CVlFBAgcnH6K6W4LJPideYG_EA7tfAe.n80Ibmu09c8ORnQ-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Twitters new approach to handling Bitcoin Core trolls", "title_full": "Twitters new approach to handling Bitcoin Core trolls", "published": "2018-05-16T08:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8f74457d41a58b9b7a2557dead2eb9773d17504", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5qj82kJRG0slCShcj4giBDuJYmzCwHQSnst7dZ29CVlFBAgcnH6K6W4LJPideYG_EA7tfAe.n80Ibmu09c8ORnQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-16T08:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Twitters new approach to handling Bitcoin Core trolls", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T09:42:52.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fafd179eea9a464528e5e6217c83c75f72943661", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMqdsrd0j8Y5izFI3hsSwSTp6Kv.rs8Xl4E-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=3197", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "PR Newswire", "title": "Bill Poulos, President of Profits Run, Predicts Cryptocurrencies are Here to Stay as CME Launches Indexes for Ethereum and Buffet Calls Bitcoin Rat Poison", "title_full": "Bill Poulos, President of Profits Run, Predicts Cryptocurrencies are Here to Stay as CME Launches Indexes for Ethereum and Buffet Calls Bitcoin Rat Poison | FinancialContent Business Page", "published": "2018-05-16T08:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fafd179eea9a464528e5e6217c83c75f72943661", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMqdsrd0j8Y5izFI3hsSwSTp6Kv.rs8Xl4E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PROFITS RUN, INC", "published": "2018-05-16T08:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bill Poulos, President of Profits Run, Predicts Cryptocurrencies are Here to Stay as CME Launches Indexes for Ethereum and Buffet Calls Bitcoin Rat Poison", "text": "WIXOM, Mich. , May 16, 2018 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Today, Bill Poulos announced his prediction on the fate of Cryptocurrencies. Poulos forecasts that cryptocurrencies are here to stay saying, \"We ain't seen nothing yet. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. As time goes on, I believe that we're going to see cryptocurrencies become more and more legitimized, playing a greater and greater role in the economies of the world.\" This projection comes as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launches Ethereum indexes, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange considers allowing investors to buy and hold bitcoin, and Warren Buffet equates bitcoin to \"rat poison\".\nMonday, May 14, 2018 , CNBC reported that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched two indexes for Ethereum. CME explained that they have no current plans for launching Ethereum futures however, CME did launch bitcoin futures in December 2017 . This came a little over a year after they launched bitcoin indexes.\nCointelegraph recently reported ( May 8, 2018 ) that Intercontinental Exchange, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), were contemplating allowing investors to buy and hold bitcoin.\nPoulos went on to say, \"There are several noted publications that are trying to profit off of scare tactics around cryptocurrency's impending doom, saying that bitcoin is going to zero in the near term. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. A few months ago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched futures contracts for bitcoin. This would not be happening unless the financial powers to be believed in the future of cryptocurrencies and believed that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. The CME then followed up on that action, launching yet another cryptocurrency futures contract, this time for Ethereum. Now you have two of the major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, both being traded through a regulated exchange. Not any exchange, a government-regulated exchange is trading both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. That is legitimizing cryptocurrencies.\"\nPoulos continued, \"Now you hear that The New York Stock Exchange, according to The New York Times , is considering letting customers buy and hold Bitcoin. They would do so through some sort of a swap investment vehicle that would settle in a couple of days, in Bitcoin. I won't go into all those details because up till now it's just hearsay—but stay tuned.\"\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is a U.S. based financial and commodity derivative exchange. It is located in Chicago, Illinois and was founded in 1898. The exchange is also popularly referred to as \"The Merc\" or \"The Chicago Merc\". It is owned by the CME Group.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a United States stock exchange located in New York, New York . It was founded on May 17, 1792 and is owned by Intercontinental Exchange. Going by market capitalization, the NYSE is the largest stock exchange in the world.\nPoulos concluded, \"All of this going on day-by-day, week-by-week further legitimizes cryptocurrencies and yet, you'll still hear from the likes of Warren Buffett , equating Bitcoin to rat poison. When Warren Buffett makes those statements, he's doing it as a way to contrast his entire investing career (around value-based investing) against a digital currency that has no inherent value in and of itself. You have to understand the context within which he's commenting. If I were a betting person, I would take Warren Buffett's comment with a grain of salt.\"\nWarren Buffet recently said that bitcoin \"is probably rat poison squared.\" Buffet is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a billionaire investor. He became involved with Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and helped grow it into the company it is today. As of February 2018 , Buffet had a net worth of almost $83 billion .\nBill Poulos is cofounder and president of Profits Run Inc.

Now that we understand what bitcoins are, have a wallet set up to store them, and have made a small amount of bitcoins to test our wallet, we’re set to start making some real amounts of bitcoins. The way we do this is by mining for them. Mining, as stated before, is a way of verifying bitcoin transactions made by other people in return for new bitcoins (given right to your wallet). There are two main types of mining: solo and pool. Solo mining is done on your own. With the hardware of an everyday person, it would take years to get earn actual bitcoins. But once you succeed, you get 50 bitcoins (worth about 500 US dollars). This takes too long, so in this Instructable, we are not going to cover this method. The method we are going to use is called pool mining. It involves signing up for an account with any one of many different companies.\nUsing their own software and hardware, they group together the mining efforts of lots of people’s computers. Every person gets a small number of bitcoins (quite often decimals of a bitcoin). As a person with a modest computer, this is the only way to go. Step 5: Setting Up a Mining Account. After trying a few different mining pools, the one that I really liked was BitMinter. It is, by far, the easiest to use. It comes with its own software, making things so much easier. Below are the few parts that involve the creation and setup of your account. 1) Open up a web browser and navigate to the BitMinter log in (https://bitminter.com/login). 2) Choose your account you’d like to link with BitMinter. Log in with this account. BitMinter uses a log in service called OpenID, which is a futuristic way of logging in with an already-existing account to eliminate the need to remember yet another password. 3) Set the main settings as according to the picture: Set your email address. Set your auto cash out threshold to a reasonable amount. Mine is set to 1 BTC (approx. $ 10). This means that when I mine 1 BTC, I will receive it into my bitcoin wallet, just like the test, but with a higher number of bitcoins. Set your “Pay to address” to the address that we used in the Step 3 to test the wallet. This is the address that all of your bitcoins are sent to, in case you haven’t figured that out yet.\nStep 6: Setting Up the Workers. Each computer needs its own worker to connect to on the BitMinter server. The software (in the next step) on each computer will each be set up to a different worker so that the BitMinter server doesn’t have trouble transmitting and receiving mining work. While still logged into the BitMinter website, hover over “My Account” at the top of the page. Then click on “Workers”.Near the bottom of the page, there are two fields under the “Name” and “Password” headers. Give your new worker a name like “Laptop”, or “New Dell”. Create a short password. Remember the password for the worker. Then click “Add”. Click “Home” in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Step 7: Install Java. Most people already have Java installed, but if you don’t, follow this step. 1) Go to www.java.com/download. 2) Click “Free Java Download”. 3) Click “Agree and Start Free Download”. 4) Depending on your operating system, a different version of the file will download. 5) Follow the onscreen instructions to continue installing the software. 6) Click finish and be done installing. Continue on to the next step to set up a miner. Step 8: Set Up a Miner. Go back to the BitMinter homepage at http://bitminter.com/. Click on the “Engine Start” button. This will download a Java Web Starter, which will download the actual program and install it. Use this file to start the program in the future.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-1/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\nCLICK HERE to submit a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitminter.com/login).", "http://bitminter.com/.", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "http://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-2/", "https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-1/", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:12:57.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4475724d73e7a771b9a6d344346316a79143da1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSjiKFwPjp6pvF3U0Mf_WLxMDlFNjifUqYBLdT9dgqq7eZWjUhcOy6RHYbIVVyKYM_TsrA5V3f4i9mZJh.SkHkBeJpEn0wsEaHfxIKfvk8C8k-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "High Quality .gifs", "title": "Walter White was into Bitcoin", "title_full": "Walter White was into Bitcoin : HighQualityGifs", "published": "2018-05-16T08:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.562, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4475724d73e7a771b9a6d344346316a79143da1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSjiKFwPjp6pvF3U0Mf_WLxMDlFNjifUqYBLdT9dgqq7eZWjUhcOy6RHYbIVVyKYM_TsrA5V3f4i9mZJh.SkHkBeJpEn0wsEaHfxIKfvk8C8k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thisdoyoucanbut", "published": "2018-05-16T08:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Walter White was into Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/thisdoyoucanbut\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgur.com/a/vJoI3wn#BZgElgt"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:21:16.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ca78c93d102b759f5eccc37c23e2c3f107b2470", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL8gBj.sIvpi.JvjgFKACZJsYn7WGv31DKI3SMFVRLEDkJQAmxT26ghe25KEyWlYJGDieMz9KiWTSM_LGk3emrlozXK6RPEpQWERqndMdD3AzSSM7vLMIMbrLisUXMvimKWNMb8qdq.KJ5VH1FawomgtuQbhe4t6Wfu2e0HT64Gg--", "site_full": "www.chinamoneynetwork.com", "site": "chinamoneynetwork.com", "site_section": "https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/feed", "site_categories": ["japan", "travel"], "section_title": "China Money Network", "title": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Firm Bitmain Leads $110M Round In Goldman-Backed FinTech Firm Circle", "title_full": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Firm Bitmain Leads $110M Round In Goldman-Backed FinTech Firm Circle", "published": "2018-05-16T08:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.chinamoneynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/20180516132955/bitmain.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ca78c93d102b759f5eccc37c23e2c3f107b2470", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL8gBj.sIvpi.JvjgFKACZJsYn7WGv31DKI3SMFVRLEDkJQAmxT26ghe25KEyWlYJGDieMz9KiWTSM_LGk3emrlozXK6RPEpQWERqndMdD3AzSSM7vLMIMbrLisUXMvimKWNMb8qdq.KJ5VH1FawomgtuQbhe4t6Wfu2e0HT64Gg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Violet Tang", "published": "2018-05-16T08:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Firm Bitmain Leads $110M Round In Goldman-Backed FinTech Firm Circle", "text": "0 0\nCircle Internet Financial Ltd., a Goldman Sachs-backed American FinTech start-up, completed a US$110 million series E funding round led by Chinese Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain Technologies Ltd. The round had the participation of IDG Capital Partners, the co-investors of the two companies.\nThe investment unveiled yesterday raised the valuation of Circle to about US$3 billion, from a reported US$480 million in 2016, making it one of the most highly valued financial start-ups in the U.S.\nCircle also announced its cooperation with Bitmain to launch a U.S. dollar-pegged digital currency named USD Coin (USDC), a blockchain-based stable coin both regulated and backed by government currency.\nTo keep the price stable, Circle customers will be required to hold US$1 for every USD Coin. Other companies, such as Tether and Basis, also have offered \"stable coins\" with a peg to the U.S. dollar as a way to deal with the high volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\"It unlocks an incredible amount of power for the dollar,\" said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle. \"It’s basically a dollar that operates on blockchain.”\nThe new cryptocurrency is based on a digital wallet interoperability project, CENTRE, developed by Circle in October 2017. The CENTRE project aims to connect the world’s main digital wallets, such as Venmo, Alipay, or Circle Pay, and thus facilitate the global transaction and settlement between different types of cryptocurrency.\n\"Bitmain and Circle are prominent in the global blockchain industry. IDG Capital Partners, as the largest institutional shareholder of Circle, is proud to connect between the East and West,” said Hugo Shong, global chairman of IDG Capital.\nThe Boston-based Circle is a blockchain one-stop financial services institution with affiliates like Circle Invest, Circle Trade providing market-making services, as well as Circle Pay, an app to settle payment.\nThe company has bought Polineiex, a digital asset exchange, in February this year, to maintain its leadership in over-the-counter bitcoin trading market.\nCircle’s other backers include Baidu Inc. and investment bank China International Capital Corp, Blockchain Capital and Tusk Venture. The company’s series D round was a US$60 million financing deal led by IDG Capital in 2016.

In the list, it should have a single transaction of 0.00001 bitcoins (approx…This value goes up and down). You now have gained a small amount of bitcoins. The general conversion of bitcoins to USD is times 10, meaning that one bitcoins is ten US dollars (easy for mental math; this number varies greatly over time). Congrats! You just made one tenth of a cent! This is a valid way to gain money. However, you can only get coins sent once every hour, so it is very slow. You won’t make any money fast with this method. Step 4: Understanding the Types of Mining. Now that we understand what bitcoins are, have a wallet set up to store them, and have made a small amount of bitcoins to test our wallet, we’re set to start making some real amounts of bitcoins. The way we do this is by mining for them. Mining, as stated before, is a way of verifying bitcoin transactions made by other people in return for new bitcoins (given right to your wallet). There are two main types of mining: solo and pool. Solo mining is done on your own. With the hardware of an everyday person, it would take years to get earn actual bitcoins. But once you succeed, you get 50 bitcoins (worth about 500 US dollars). This takes too long, so in this Instructable, we are not going to cover this method. The method we are going to use is called pool mining. It involves signing up for an account with any one of many different companies.\nUsing their own software and hardware, they group together the mining efforts of lots of people’s computers. Every person gets a small number of bitcoins (quite often decimals of a bitcoin). As a person with a modest computer, this is the only way to go. Step 5: Setting Up a Mining Account. After trying a few different mining pools, the one that I really liked was BitMinter. It is, by far, the easiest to use. It comes with its own software, making things so much easier. Below are the few parts that involve the creation and setup of your account. 1) Open up a web browser and navigate to the BitMinter log in (https://bitminter.com/login). 2) Choose your account you’d like to link with BitMinter. Log in with this account. BitMinter uses a log in service called OpenID, which is a futuristic way of logging in with an already-existing account to eliminate the need to remember yet another password. 3) Set the main settings as according to the picture: Set your email address. Set your auto cash out threshold to a reasonable amount. Mine is set to 1 BTC (approx. $10). This means that when I mine 1 BTC, I will receive it into my bitcoin wallet, just like the test, but with a higher number of bitcoins. Set your “Pay to address” to the address that we used in the Step 3 to test the wallet. This is the address that all of your bitcoins are sent to, in case you haven’t figured that out yet.\nStep 6: Setting Up the Workers. Each computer needs its own worker to connect to on the BitMinter server. The software (in the next step) on each computer will each be set up to a different worker so that the BitMinter server doesn’t have trouble transmitting and receiving mining work. While still logged into the BitMinter website, hover over “My Account” at the top of the page. Then click on “Workers”.Near the bottom of the page, there are two fields under the “Name” and “Password” headers. Give your new worker a name like “Laptop”, or “New Dell”. Create a short password. Remember the password for the worker. Then click “Add”. Click “Home” in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Step 7: Install Java. Most people already have Java installed, but if you don’t, follow this step. 1) Go to www.java.com/download. 2) Click “Free Java Download”. 3) Click “Agree and Start Free Download”. 4) Depending on your operating system, a different version of the file will download. 5) Follow the onscreen instructions to continue installing the software. 6) Click finish and be done installing. Continue on to the next step to set up a miner. Step 8: Set Up a Miner. Go back to the BitMinter homepage at http://bitminter.com/. Click on the “Engine Start” button. This will download a Java Web Starter, which will download the actual program and install it. Use this file to start the program in the future.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-1/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitminter.com/login).", "http://bitminter.com/.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T11:09:14.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76f531c1976d4e1fc65afd3ab7334ab51c6fea99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSr52Zbh4bbsm6Hy96wZiQ0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin a Scam - No more", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin a Scam - No more", "published": "2018-05-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76f531c1976d4e1fc65afd3ab7334ab51c6fea99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSr52Zbh4bbsm6Hy96wZiQ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Boomerang Capital", "published": "2018-05-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin a Scam - No more", "text": "#consensus2018\nThe narrative has changed.

May 16, 2018 No Comments\nI have no idea if Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are wise investments. I do know that the energy required to maintain new digital currencies is substantial. From a power consumption standpoint, is Bitcoin a sustainable currency? Could the hydronics community help these currencies stay relevant?\nMy novice understanding of the Bitcoin process is that you can buy, sell and/or find these units of currency. Buying and selling is pretty straightforward. You can buy Bitcoins and exchange them with people who accept them, just like an online credit card transaction. The way you find these digital tokens of currency is through a process called mining.\nTo become a Bitcoin miner, you need to buy a specific type of server computer. The hardware runs particular software that may have to try billions of combinations to match and verify groups of buy/sell transactions that are occurring. By mining, you can find Bitcoins. The Bitcoin is essentially a reward for verifying transactions within the community. To me, this seems very similar to a bank keeping track of trades and earning a percentage of the money exchanged as a fee.\nAccording to a Forbes article, Bitcoin required 29 times more energy than all of the Tesla cars on the road combined in 2017. As Bitcoin grows in popularity, the number of computers required to crunch the transactions is growing. In the early days of Bitcoin, you could mine using a consumer-grade computer in your basement. Now, the community needs an enormous amount of data centers and the associated electrical power draw.\nBitcoin mining is growing in North America. An Earther.com article states: “In past years, Chinese companies had more or less cornered the cryptocurrency mining market. Taking advantage of cheap power — sometimes as little as 2 cents per kWh, while the U.S. industrial average was 6.6 cents as of 2017 —these mining operations operate at a scale and cost margin that has been difficult to challenge, resulting in Chinese miners accounting for two thirds of the Bitcoin network’s processing power.”\nThe Chinese government isn’t that excited about Bitcoin farming anymore and is encouraging their citizens to slow down with the servers. This is forcing the members of the Bitcoin mining community to look elsewhere for cheap electricity. North American communities with inexpensive kWh rates, generally near hydroelectric dams, are a good fit.\nThe eastern Washington State communities near the Columbia River are seeing a jump in new neighbors. The new faces in town aren’t looking to start apple farms, as has been the long-standing tradition in the area. They are looking to build mega-server buildings. Politico.com writes: “The commercial miners now pouring into the valley are building sites with tens of thousands of servers and electrical loads of as much as 30 megawatts, or enough to power a neighborhood of 13,000 homes.”\nAs more people buy and sell things with Bitcoin, the complexity of mining the transactions increases. If the value of a Bitcoin doesn’t consistently increase, it won’t make sense to build a mega warehouse of servers in order to justify the cost of mining. As of December 11, 2017, you would have been crazy not to start building a mountain of servers, because the price per Bitcoin almost broke $20,000 USD. As of the end of March, the price per Bitcoin was about $7,000 USD. While $7,000 per unit is still an awesome investment, if you bought a Bitcoin for below a dollar in 2011, it could be hard to support the volume of transactions going forward.\nHow does this actually pencil out? This January 2018 Forbes article states:\n“Just a few years into the cryptocurrency revolution, Bitcoin mining is already eating up an estimated 20,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year. That’s roughly 0.1 percent of global generation, on par with the power demand of Ireland. The primary culprits are Bitcoin mining appliances like the Antminer S9, which is a computer processor that does nothing but endlessly crunch algorithms to lengthen the blockchain. An Antminer draws a load of 1.5 kilowatts — enough to power two refrigerators and a flat screen TV. If you run an Antminer 24/7 for a year, it will produce about 0.85 Bitcoins, at a cost of about 15,000 kilowatt-hours. Depending on your power prices, it will cost anywhere from $600 (at 3 cents per kWh) to $1,800 (at 9 cents per Kwh) to mine one coin.”\nI found a bunch of online calculators that let you run the numbers to see if mining is a good investment. You enter the cost of the computer you buy, processor power, energy consumption and other factors. With the Antminer S7, at ~$7,000 USD per Bitcoin value, you would only be profitable if your price per kWh power stays under $0.07. It would take you about two years to make your money back, if the price of Bitcoin stays stable. If the price per Bitcoin drops, or your electrical rates rise, it would cost you money to mine. Similar to mining a mineral in the ground, I guess.\nAs is common in the tech industry, someone may develop a better software program that manages the transactions more efficiently. Faster computer processors would help, too. Lower energy consumption servers or inexpensive kWh power is another option. Energy efficient cooling could be another way to make Bitcoin mining more cost-effective.\nAs seasoned heating and cooling experts may imagine, some of these server farms aren’t the pinnacles of cooling technology. In many cases, cobbling together a bunch of residential PTAC systems is the current method of choice. If computers run too hot, they aren’t as efficient as they could be. The wear and tear of components like cooling fans will also increase in poorly cooled spaces.\nCould radiant cooling help lower the cost of mining a Bitcoin? Engineers who are serious about energy efficiency can’t deny the upside of covering a large share of the sensible cooling load with hydronics. The kWh burden of cooling a warehouse of servers would be lightened with an actively cooled floor or ceiling.\nSome tech companies are putting the servers themselves directly into liquid. The MIT Technology Review has an article about an Intel project where they put the servers in tanks of mineral oil. By doing this, they claim, “[Intel] can cut power consumption from servers by 10 percent to 15 percent and from cooling equipment by about 90 percent, according to the company.”\nWhether or not you invest in Bitcoin or any sort of digital currency mining, lots of other people will be building servers in the future to keep track of our ever-expanding digital dependent lifestyles.

Bill's statement comes as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange May 16, 2018 12:40 AM EDT Blog This\nWIXOM, Mich. , May 16, 2018 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Today, Bill Poulos announced his prediction on the fate of Cryptocurrencies. Poulos forecasts that cryptocurrencies are here to stay saying, \"We ain't seen nothing yet. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. As time goes on, I believe that we're going to see cryptocurrencies become more and more legitimized, playing a greater and greater role in the economies of the world.\" This projection comes as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launches Ethereum indexes, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange considers allowing investors to buy and hold bitcoin, and Warren Buffet equates bitcoin to \"rat poison\".\nMonday, May 14, 2018 , CNBC reported that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched two indexes for Ethereum. CME explained that they have no current plans for launching Ethereum futures however, CME did launch bitcoin futures in December 2017 . This came a little over a year after they launched bitcoin indexes.\nCointelegraph recently reported ( May 8, 2018 ) that Intercontinental Exchange, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), were contemplating allowing investors to buy and hold bitcoin.\nPoulos went on to say, \"There are several noted publications that are trying to profit off of scare tactics around cryptocurrency's impending doom, saying that bitcoin is going to zero in the near term. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. A few months ago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched futures contracts for bitcoin. This would not be happening unless the financial powers to be believed in the future of cryptocurrencies and believed that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. The CME then followed up on that action, launching yet another cryptocurrency futures contract, this time for Ethereum. Now you have two of the major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, both being traded through a regulated exchange. Not any exchange, a government-regulated exchange is trading both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. That is legitimizing cryptocurrencies.\"\nPoulos continued, \"Now you hear that The New York Stock Exchange, according to The New York Times , is considering letting customers buy and hold Bitcoin. They would do so through some sort of a swap investment vehicle that would settle in a couple of days, in Bitcoin. I won't go into all those details because up till now it's just hearsay—but stay tuned.\"\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is a U.S. based financial and commodity derivative exchange. It is located in Chicago, Illinois and was founded in 1898. The exchange is also popularly referred to as \"The Merc\" or \"The Chicago Merc\". It is owned by the CME Group.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a United States stock exchange located in New York, New York . It was founded on May 17, 1792 and is owned by Intercontinental Exchange. Going by market capitalization, the NYSE is the largest stock exchange in the world.\nPoulos concluded, \"All of this going on day-by-day, week-by-week further legitimizes cryptocurrencies and yet, you'll still hear from the likes of Warren Buffett , equating Bitcoin to rat poison. When Warren Buffett makes those statements, he's doing it as a way to contrast his entire investing career (around value-based investing) against a digital currency that has no inherent value in and of itself. You have to understand the context within which he's commenting. If I were a betting person, I would take Warren Buffett's comment with a grain of salt.\"\nWarren Buffet recently said that bitcoin \"is probably rat poison squared.\" Buffet is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a billionaire investor. He became involved with Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and helped grow it into the company it is today. As of February 2018 , Buffet had a net worth of almost $83 billion .\nBill Poulos is cofounder and president of Profits Run Inc.

There was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair even broke the last swing low and it could continue to decline towards the $1,200 level. Bitcoin cash price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now trading well below $1,300 with a bearish angle in the short term.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline Yesterday, we discussed how $1,480 and $1,500 levels stopped the upside move in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price failed to move above the mentioned levels and declined sharply below $1,400. The decline was such that the price even broke the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,330 low to $1,495 high.\nIt opened the doors for more losses and there was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair even settled below the $1,300 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. These are bearish signs below $1,300 and it seems like the price may continue to trade lower in the short term. It is currently trading near the $1,240 level with a lot of selling pressure. If it corrects higher it could test the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,495 high to $1,240 low.\nLooking at the chart , the price may continue to accelerate declines towards the $1,200 level. Any further declines would depend how buyers react around the stated $1,200 support level in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is accelerating momentum in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has reached the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $1,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,300\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Tumbled Below $1,300 appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T07:39:43.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5f456d7fed0b6e3c01599e091f21e876153d223", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8QzrhMOujLBqmel18BMZkZoP_kJVlzxIdqGwniwLAgNxMI1avc2l.aA4IDrHp1f9CLyUWs701JuK", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Meanwhile in Bitcoin Core Headquarters", "title_full": "Meanwhile in Bitcoin Core Headquarters : btc", "published": "2018-05-16T07:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.121, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a5f456d7fed0b6e3c01599e091f21e876153d223", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8QzrhMOujLBqmel18BMZkZoP_kJVlzxIdqGwniwLAgNxMI1avc2l.aA4IDrHp1f9CLyUWs701JuK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jimukgb", "published": "2018-05-16T07:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Meanwhile in Bitcoin Core Headquarters", "text": "submitted by /u/jimukgb\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://v.redd.it/j0oc2700v3y01"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T05:11:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93f66e84ceaf82ddcaaa3e6233904a3ab3a95c35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocGHv3qYCf1.I-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-16T07:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93f66e84ceaf82ddcaaa3e6233904a3ab3a95c35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocGHv3qYCf1.I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Latviand", "published": "2018-05-16T07:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: alvinmtp on May 15, 2018, 04:38:05 PM I won't say those who are investing in bitcoin is foolish because most of us earned already good profit from btc and still believing to hold as it can give more profit anytime in coming months.

He is an economics graduate and used to work as an equity derivatives trader. BitMEX is the world’s largest Bitcoin trading platform by volume. The company has gained quite a reputation in a very short period of time as it offers 100 % leverage in margin trading for its users.\nArthur said that the company currently does not deal with non-institutional traders instead they deal with retail traders. The company offers access to financial products for investors around the world using cryptocurrency. According to the reports, the distinctive factor about the company is that it offers highly leveraged derivatives, a hundred times leverage.\nHe describes the market to be highly volatile and exchange platforms largely trade in liquid. He further adds:\n“There is not much of institutional presence in crypto, as of now it’s more of a retailer phenomenon. We hold bitcoin a large amount of it, we are secure but the risk is there in any business. Most traders don’t use 100 percent leverage, as there is a limited liability but there is.”\nHe also said that people are expecting the upcoming future wherein the entry of institutions into the cryptocurrency is questioned. Asia is dominating in crypto because they grasp easily as they have been used to it.\nOn the other hand, U.S. already has a well built financial processing system so people find it more cozy to use traditional trading methods rather than new technology. The fresh developing markets which lack the access to the brokers and high exchange rates have to find alternatives such as cryptocurrency.\nA twitterati said:\n“Anthony you are a too smart man.

Resistance: $8,500, $8,400, $8,300 Support: $7,900, $8,000, $8,100 Yesterday, May 15, the BTCUSD pair traded above the $8,500 price level and, at the same time, the bearish trend line was broken. Secondly, the candlestick also closed on the opposite of the trend line. The price action also showed that the price retouched the trend line and began a ranged bound movement. Based of that, it was assumed that the downtrend was over. It was previously stated that Bitcoin price is unlikely to continue its downtrend. Today, the price was trading at $8,341.68 at the time of writing. However, the weekly chart shows that it fell again to the previous day's low of $8,341.68. Nevertheless, if the asset continues its fall, it will certainly retest the previous low of $8,000. The relative strength index period 14 is level 27 indicating that the market is oversold. This suggests that the bulls will take control of the market. However, that does not mean the price will not retest the previous low of $8,000 because it can rally even at the oversold market condition. BTCUSD Short-term Trend: Bearish The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has a bearish outlook. Yesterday, the asset was trading at $8,700 in a range bound movement. Later, the price fell to $8,500 and resumed its range bound movement. Bitcoin finally fell to $8,300. Since the price has broken the $8,500 level, it may find support at $8,000.
