It’s an opportunity for crypto celebs to tread the red carpet and for everyone from minnows to whales to mingle, network, and learn. But if you’re not careful, it’s also a chance to get your devices pwned and your cryptocurrency swiped.\nAlso read: Xapo Estimated to be Housing 6.25% of Total BTC Supply May Is the Month for Blockchain Conferences\nThere are cryptocurrency conferences all through the year, but May is when they reach their zenith. Last weekend saw Futurama in Dubai, a glitzy event whose guests included Brock Pierce and whose closing party took place on a yacht in the Gulf. Next week it’s the turn of Consensus NYC, the industry’s largest event that will welcome 7,000 attendees and hundreds of delegates.\nThe cumulative value of the portfolios swilling around inside New York’s Hilton Midtown will comfortably run into the billions of dollars. The vast majority of that wealth will have been left at home on hardware devices and paper wallets stashed in secure vaults, but that doesn’t mean attendees will be immune from thieves.\nFor one thing, you probably have more of your crypto holdings on an exchange, readily accessible via the 2FA app in your pocket, than you’d care to admit. And for another, hackers don’t have to strike at the event. They can phish or social engineer now and strike later when you’re on the other side of the world, or when you’re on the long-haul flight home and unaware that your SIM card has just been swapped. Keep Calm and Be Prepared\nThe first rule when attending any public conference, especially one as high profile as Consensus, is to avoid insecure wifi networks. How do you know if a network’s insecure? You probably don’t, which is why you’re best relying on mobile data only. That wifi point named after the conference you’re attending could just as easily be a honeypot.\nIf you must connect via wifi while at the conference or your hotel, be sure to use a VPN. In addition, keep your cellphone’s bluetooth and NFC turned off and don’t plug it into a USB point to charge. You don’t know what’s on the other end of that cable, and while it could be innocuous, it could just as easily be extracting your data. Be Careful What You Share and Who You Share It With\nThe best thing about blockchain conferences isn’t the panel discussions and it certainly isn’t the ICO pitches. No, the best part is the after-parties. All those networking opportunities and chances to bump fists with crypto bros you’ve previously only known as an avatar in a Telegram group. Some words of caution are necessary though.\nLiterally anyone can whip together a business card purporting to be an investor or OTC broker, pull on an expensive shirt, and extend a firm handshake. Due to the public nature of crypto conferences, there is no means of vetting participants, and no easy means of telling who’s legit and who’s a snake. That ICO whale who’s befriended you and returned to your room for drinks could be the real deal…or they could just be waiting for an opportunity to slip something in your vodka and pilfer your laptop once you’ve passed out. Crypto People Are Good People\nThis advice isn’t intended to be alarmist. Crypto people are some of the friendliest and most generous people you could ever hope to meet IRL (the less said about their Twitter personas the better). Provided you follow basic op-sec, you will be able to relax at the conference, enjoy yourself, and forge friendships that will last for years. Be careful, though, not to brag about gains, share portfolios, or engage in any other behavior that could mark you out as a target.\nIf possible, leave your primary laptop and smartphone at home and travel with a burner. That way, whatever happens, you’ll wake up regretting nothing more than that last shot of tequila. Be discrete, conceal your wealth, and remember that there’s no such thing as free wifi. Do all that and you’ll be sure to have a ball.\nWhat other precautions do you think conference delegates should take?

BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet will be available on the Huawei AppGallery.\nHuawei Technologies is the world’s third-biggest mobile phone maker, which is really popular in China.\nThe application will be pre-installed on new Huawei phones and will be available for download on existing phones. The wallet gives the users a chance to interact with the digital currency app for the very first time.\nIt will also be the first wallet released by the company. Many experts speculate that this move would have a major impact on the Chinese market as more than 62% of the population uses Huawei. China has also been a major player in the crypto-market and Bitcoin exchanges are expected to rise in the upcoming month in China.\nThe Chinese government has been very hostile towards cryptocurrency. The government had shut down all the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. They even banned the trading platform and initial coin offerings [ICOs]. However, it is not illegal in China to own virtual currency, making China a hotbed for cryptocurrency for the last few months.\nDE LA Torre, a major figure in Huawei said:\n“It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.”\nJaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei said:\n“From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we epect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.”\nAlejendaro de la Torre, the director of business operations at Bitcoin.com said:\n“China has seen an explosive growth in online payments, Contrary to popular belief China’s strict stance towards cryptocurrency is mainly aimed at exchanges.

Required fields are marked * Comment Bitcoin [BTC] sees a turn of events – Crashes below $9000 mark\nPublished Aman Swami Source: Wikimedia Commons\nBitcoin dropped back below $9,000 as the recovery failed on approach to $9,400 resistance without convincing drivers to support nascent bullish momentum. BTC/USD is trading at $8,788.62, declining at 6.01% in the last 24 hours. The coin has seen a decline of 1.31% in the last 1 hour as well.\nBitcoin price may fly as high as $64,000 due to growing mining activity, which is roughly five times from current BTC/USD exchange rate, according to Fundstrat analysts. Experts believe that processing power needed to solve a mathematical puzzle, known as hash power will increase 350% in 2019.\nHead of Data Science Research at Fundstrat, Sam Doctor says:\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range.”\nMiners are likely to hold Bitcoin when its price falls to break-even for operating costs, and sell it when the price is growing to take profit, the expert explains.\nBitcoin is not alone in this market decline, the top 10 currencies show negative numbers as of today in the last one hour, last 24 hours as well as their 7-day average. This has caused one major change as Bitcoin dominance has increased by 1% despite its declining market performance. This is because all the altcoins experience a decline. Bitcoin dominance has increased from 36.4% to 37.4%.\nTo many in the cryptocurrency industry, this feels like a shock and they fail to understand the reason behind this price drop because a couple of days ago crypto experts were all excited about it breaking through the $10000 mark and predicted more than 100% by the end of the year.\nIn a state of confusion where eyes of the investors see declining numbers and organizations like Fundstrat sell a dream of a Bitcoin priced at $64000, one is bound to question the authenticity of the coin market and the base on which it is set. “The blockchain is a magic wand”– John McAfee\nPublished Anirudh VK Source: Unsplash\nJohn McAfee stuck to his bullish prediction for Bitcoin, among other things, on a Twitter interview with Adel de Meyer, the co-founder of ‘The Crypto Collectors’. He described blockchain as one of the biggest events in the history of human culture, saying:\n“An event seldom changes our culture in ways that can be clearly seen, measured and felt. In the past 200 years, there have been two events. The first was The Industrial revolution. The second was the digital revolution. I think that the Blockchain will dwarf both.”\nHe also said that blockchain is the ‘engine’ that would allow us to access human potential in ways that would accelerate human evolution, going on to say that the blockchain can support any distributed structure. He said:\n“If existing companies transformed to operate on the blockchain, all functions would be distributed. There would be no more bosses, no hierarchical organization, no power of influence greater than anyony [sic] else.”\nHe also explored the potential of blockchain as a disruptor in today’s hierarchical power systems, saying ‘math can precisely transform hierarchical systems into distributed systems’ and that the limiting factor would be the flexibility of humans. He went on to ask whether we, as humans, can ‘abdicate our power in favor of a new order’.\nWhen asked about his opinion on the politics of technological revolutions and whether technology should be free of politics, McAfee said that technology can be used for good and bad, citing the example of the nuclear bomb and nuclear energy. He said:\n“The blockchain is a magic wand. What world would you like to see appear before your eyes? Think carefully before you wave it.”\nHe said that he is ‘more certain than ever’ about his famously bullish prediction for Bitcoin to reach a value of $1 Million by 2020. He also remarked that Golem Network [GNT] is his favorite altcoin at the moment, saying:\n“It is a decentralized way of using your spare computing power in conjoined effort with any other member of the community to help massive projects otherwise impossible to accomplish. I like conservation in software.

Such actions in the past had reportedly affected global prices several times since November.As of press time Friday, Bitcoin had lost around $800, or 8.5 percent, in the past 24 hours, hitting the lowest price the coin has seen since April 20.Across altcoin markets, Ethereum (ETH) posted near 12 percent losses, while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fared worse, both losing about 17 percent over the same period.Market visualization from Coin360While some local sources took to social media to suggest the price dip was an “overreaction” on the part of cryptocurrency holders, the episode is a test for Korean exchanges, which only recently returned to the listings of popular price tracker resource CoinMarketCap.Previously, the major crypto price tracker had removed key South Korean exchanges from its price average computations over what it described as an “extreme divergence” between prices listed there and on exchanges in other countries.

Overnight, the largest crypto exchange in Korea, Upbit, was raided by prosecutors for suspicion of fraud.\nSouth Korean authorities suspect that Upbit has been selling cryptocurrency to customers that it doesn’t actually own. This suspicion is widespread among savvy market participants, who believe that many of the big crypto exchanges are operating a form of fractional reserve trading, and allowing market participants to “ sell short ” crypto currencies that have not been deposited on the exchange. Market participants engaged in selling short merely deposit fiat currency which is used to initiate the trade.\nIf so, the question would be what does the person on the other side of the trade actually buy? It would appear that what is purchased isn’t actually a digital currency, but rather a ledger entry of the exchange which amounts to a promise to deliver said crypto currency.\nAll goes unnoticed until there are more requests to withdraw said crypto currency than are actually held by the exchange. That is the point that the exchange risks failure. As long as buyers don’t attempt to withdraw their digital coins and tokens , and leave them on the exchange, the situation of short sellers being able to sell more of a crypto currency than is actually available for sale will cause nothing more than an artificially low price.\nHowever, if the buyers do attempt to withdraw in this situation, it could cause the failure of the exchange, which could include people losing their entire investment.\nIt is for this reason – and others – that many veterans in the cryptosphere repeat the mantra: Never leave your coins and tokens on an exchange. Always withdraw them into your own wallet.\nAs the gold bugs are fond of saying, “If you don’t hold it, you don’t own it.” Post navigation ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto news chronicle last", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:01:42.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88bd757dd1ad853b9d6b9957ce8ec10b0bdfcae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf47TKoCV9yiJdtXvcQ.7lmcjJuh1DhftUgJPjsXN91uur0CCVzveAGeTYrDbJvZuxD3pPrDjVVOBHm43XxFnltDXqReyV24y5A--", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin a 'Troubling' Payment System: Bank of America Executive", "title_full": "Bitcoin a 'Troubling' Payment System: Bank of America Executive", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bank-of-america-bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88bd757dd1ad853b9d6b9957ce8ec10b0bdfcae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf47TKoCV9yiJdtXvcQ.7lmcjJuh1DhftUgJPjsXN91uur0CCVzveAGeTYrDbJvZuxD3pPrDjVVOBHm43XxFnltDXqReyV24y5A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin a 'Troubling' Payment System: Bank of America Executive", "text": "Bitcoin a ‘Troubling’ Payment System: Bank of America Executive Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nBank of America remains hawkish toward cryptocurrency as a form of payment, due to its disruption of the banking sector’s regulations on transparency. Cryptocurrencies present authorities with more challenges for catching “bad guys,” a company executive said Thursday.\nCathy Bessant, Bank of America ‘s chief technical officer, set the tone for what she sees as two distinct uses for cryptocurrency: payments and investing. As a form of payment, cryptocurrency is dangerous because it is not in line with banking’s policies for tracking payments.\n“The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial [movement] of money,” she said, speaking from CNBC’s Capital Exchange breakfast series in Washington, D.C. “Cryptos is the antithesis of that.”\nShe added:\n“As a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent.”\nCasting cryptocurrency in a good guy vs. bad guy narrative is a common theme for traditional banks and investment funds. Executives undervalue key pain points that cryptocurrencies attempt to resolve in the financial sector (such as slow payment settlement and transaction fees), while sounding alarm bells for criminal activity. As CCN reported , Berkshire Hathaway VC Charlie Munger said Bitcoin was almost as “bad as trading baby brains.” Like many large institutions, Bank of America has instituted a policy that bars customers from using its credit cards to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThough Bessant does not see legitimate use cases for crypto as a form of payment, customers can still invest in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — just not with Bank of America-issued credit cards. BofA views cryptocurrencies loosely as stocks. Their customer policies thus reflect this line of thinking.\n“Just like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards,” Bessant said.\nSo while some banks classify concurrency payments with credit cards as cash advances (with high fees), BofA doesn’t allow them at all.\nAs regulations for cryptocurrency are still in early stages, BofA stands out as a financial giant with a tough stance on the debate. To BofA it seems that the cryptocurrency space is full of hackers and modern day Robin Hoods.

Reply TheGush Definitely scary and not outside of the realm of possibility. I really hope that this is not the case, and my belief (or maybe cognitive bias) is a totally different view of this same chart than yours. That’s the beauty of subjective perspective. That same phases of a bubble graphic that also shows the vertical phases of adoption (time based rather than value based)- if I look at that... what I see, in line with my beliefs in the fundamentals of this market- is that we are after the “first selloff”, approaching the “institutional investors” phase- which is shortly followed by “media attention”, and THEN goes the euphoria phase. Smart money is here. Institutional investors will be in the next 6-12 months, and the real media attention is still yet to come. The media attention we are getting is minimal. Just because they mention bitcoin a couple times a day, show a BTC ticker or have Roger Ver show up on CNBC doesn’t mean that’s the media frenzy/hype. I believe that you are feeling we are much farther in the adoption phase than we actually are. Dilate that whole chart. That cycle is more like a 15-20 year narrative (from when BTC was created), not a 10 year one. We haven’t approached euphoria yet. It will come when we hit 40,000-50,000 and it’s all the media is talking about. All your friends and family will be telling about bitcoin, not your niche buddies with similar interests on the internet. Of course the bubble could pop for good before we ever get to these places. I know nothing and I’m not saying you’re wrong. I’m just saying that my view is equally as valid since neither of us have a crystal ball. (I’m asking Santa for one this Christmas). All said, I think we have reached a level of momentum in investor attention (and not just retail at this point) that we are not likely going to see it just go away here. You have MASSIVE exchanges/investors/hedge fund managers, financial experts, etc taking great interest in the market and its future- and many have strong positive expectations for the coming years. They can’t all be wrong. They didn’t get in those positions by being idiots. And why anyone listens to Warren Buffet’s opinion on Bitcoin is beyond me. He has said so many times that he doesn’t understand technology. He said that he invests in Apple, but doesn’t understand the technology a bit. He invests in it based on the company and their vision behind it and how they have loyal customers, etc. That’s why to him, Bitcoin is ghost. There’s no company behind it. There’s no dividends (he loves his dividends). To him, it’s backed by nothing, as he said. Why? He’s old as hell and doesn’t understand how something not backed by a board, without a CEO, a headquarters, etc can offer long term value. It’s because that’s all he’s know his whole life. He’s an expert at that. But he knows absolutely nothing about cryptocurrency and that has come directly out of his own mouth. So why would anyone trust his opinion on this?! Reply MrRenev TheGush @TheGush , Warren Buffet has always been right. Bitcoin fits the definition of a bubble that reached the top, and in percent it is the biggest human kind has ever had. To see this we look at a chart starting 3 years before the top. Bitcoin bigger than Mississipi bubble. The \"institutional\" investors don't come when 2/3 of the planet are invested in something like here. Look anywhere, how popular crypto is. On Trading View it's more popular than ALL other assets combined. Look at what top ideas are. They ain't about Oil or GBPUSD that's for sure. I looked at so many charts and they look the same. If we were at sell off early stage and about to go super saiyan they wouldn't be enough money in the world to buy Bitcoin to push the price that much even if all alts disappeared and only BTC was left and got al lthe money. Reply TheGush MrRenev @MrRenev , I have to disagree. You’ve made several statements not based on fact, but on pure estimation and guesswork. First problem: Buffett isn’t always right. He said that Amazon and Google were not worth investing in. He admits he has caused a lot of people to lose money. “The Oracle of Omaha also professed ignorance on other big technology stocks, whose rallies he missed because he didn't quite appreciate their value proposition at first glance.” Because why? He “didn’t appreciate their value proposition.” He is notoriously wrong about technology. He has a track record for bad calls on technology related ventures, and even admits this (read the article for many things he has acknowledged as being poor judgment): https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/06/warren-buffett-admits-he-made-a-mistake-on-google.html Second problem: Instituonal investors don’t jump in when 2/3 of the planet own an asset already? You’re WAY off. Again, let’s go with actual evidence. This survey was published within the last week. https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/05/09/how-many-people-actually-own-cryptocurrency/ It’s pretty robust. One of the biggest surveys about crypto taken to date. Findings? About 75% of people have heard of cryptocurrency. Only 50% actually know what it even is. The global average of people that actually own any cryptocurrency is about 7% and this sample was only taken from an Internet-connected population, which skews the numbers high, in reality. I have seen actual figures being closer to 1% when the whole population is considered. Far from your 60% estimate. Obviously most of these investors are retail investors with minimal capital to invest compared to institutional money. Meaning: this is merely change in the bucket. But not for too much longer: At least 56 financial firms will enter the crypto market within the next 6 months 1 in 5 financial firms are considering entering the crypto market Not to mention ICE, parent of NYSE is interested... and big entities like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc. We already have CME and CBOE on board. But you said institutional investors don’t come in at this point. Then why do so many have plans to open exchanges/derivitive trading in the next few months? Why are governments so interested in regulation of a bubble that has already popped? And while it doesn’t mean they’re right, Fundstrat Survey indicates that 82% of institutional investors believe that the market has bottomed out. So that would mean that they do not subscribe to your bubble belief. Finally, don’t forget that a bubble pop doesn’t mean the market is destroyed. It just means that it has lost most of its value, typically in a short period of time. So by that definition, the bubble has already popped multiple times. Yet it’s still here and people are still interested after it has lost 60-90% of its value multiple times and has not only recovered each time, but set new ATH’s. I think you may do a bit more research into things here. You seem quite unaware of all that is going on and has gone on. Bring me more fact/evidence based information and we can have a legitimate debate.

Between March 2010 and mid-December 2017, the value of an individual bitcoin token surged from a low of $0.003 to (briefly) more than $20,000 per token. A prescient $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you could find someone willing to part with that many bitcoin (333,333 tokens), would have been worth billions of dollars as of this past December.\nCryptocurrency optimists view bitcoin and blockchain technology as a game-changers for monetary theory and how currency is transferred from one party to another, which is a big reason bitcoin has been so successful thus far.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBitcoin's underlying blockchain is its digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that works around traditional banking networks to record and process transactions. Most notably, blockchain offers the ability to transfer funds from one party to another considerably quicker than with current banking networks, especially in cross-border transactions. Sending funds overseas may take moments to validate and settle with blockchain, whereas traditional banking networks may take up to five business days to settle cross-border remittances.\nStop comparing bitcoin to gold! They're nothing alike The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also drawn regular comparisons to gold, which is viewed as the go-to investment anytime fear, volatility, and/or inflation rear their heads. This comparison takes shape given the relative scarcity of each asset. In other words, there's a 21-million-coin limit on the number of bitcoin that can be mined, just as there's a limit on the amount of gold that can be mined from our planet. Therefore, the assumption has been made that bitcoin can act as a store of value much in the same way gold has for investors.\nHowever, I'm here to tell you, again , and for the last time, that you shouldn't believe everything you hear about bitcoin. It isn't, and will never be , the \"new gold.\" How do I know this? The answer lies in a number of comparative tests that bitcoin simply fails when put side by side with gold.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere's absolutely no application comparison To begin with, there's the application of gold versus bitcoin. Bitcoin exists in the digital realm as code . It's not tangible. You can't put it in your hand or do anything with it, aside from using it as a medium of exchange, or hoping that someone else comes along at a later date and pays more for it, per token, than you did.\nOn the other hand, gold is a physical asset that can be held in the palm of one's hand. It also has practical uses, such as being a conductor in electronic equipment, as the primary metal in fine jewelry, and as crowns in the cosmetic dental industry, to name a few uses. One asset is tangible and has practical use, the other exists entirely within the digital realm. Not comparable.\nA false sense of scarcity Another comparison that fails to hold muster is scarcity. When it comes to gold, all we're ever going to have is what's on this planet. Putting aside science fiction hype of mining asteroids, what we have in the ground and have already mined is all the gold we're ever going to get. That provides a true physical cap on gold, allowing investors to make a genuine case for scarcity.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin does have a 21-million-coin cap, but this is only limited by protocols . Admittedly, getting consensus on bitcoin's network to increase the coin limit would be very difficult -- but the point is that it's not impossible. We can't wave a wand and make more gold appear out of thin air, but computer coders with the backing of the bitcoin community could do just that and create more bitcoin.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nTo add to this point, even without increasing the coin limit above 21 million, bitcoin's numerous hard forks essentially violate the idea of a token limit and scarcity. Bitcoin has had three instances since August where a disagreement between developers on the future path of bitcoin and its blockchain resulted in the creation of a new currency. These spinoffs of sorts -- Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private -- topple the idea of true scarcity, as new coins have been, or could continue to be, created from bitcoin.\nGold has history on its side In terms of which asset has history on its side, that, too, goes to gold. Gold has been used as a currency for more than 2,700 years and is today a highly liquid asset, at least in terms of futures contract trading. It's also an asset held by central banks all over the globe. While you're not likely to pay for your morning cup of coffee with a gold ingot, gold has been viewed as an accepted form of currency for a long time.\nHowever, bitcoin doesn't have that tenured history. There are no fundamental tethers that allow investors to make a reasonable determination about bitcoin's value, and liquidity on bitcoin futures contracts has been spotty at times. Additionally, there are no governments holding bitcoin in their vaults, as they do with gold.\nThe bottom line is that gold and bitcoin are nothing alike -- and to think that bitcoin will behave similarly to gold could prove to be a big mistake.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T17:26:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08f7b27dbc974bf3a887d7f8c11aed47336fdc5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RTx8pNdCT9VwZLNJ9SGk_Z0eYCb113rMD5M99.m34Br_fenKactswAeH6ReT1X.icG.D2FHnFs1LTPZiTymcx.2LUyz4Ro3bwgIRDr9XB2yrSNoc2f12Z1", "site_full": "atbitcoin.com", "site": "atbitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Plunges Ahead Of Blockchain Week; Facebook Eyes Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Plunges Ahead Of Blockchain Week; Facebook Eyes Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.106, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08f7b27dbc974bf3a887d7f8c11aed47336fdc5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RTx8pNdCT9VwZLNJ9SGk_Z0eYCb113rMD5M99.m34Br_fenKactswAeH6ReT1X.icG.D2FHnFs1LTPZiTymcx.2LUyz4Ro3bwgIRDr9XB2yrSNoc2f12Z1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Plunges Ahead Of Blockchain Week; Facebook Eyes Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "text": "Bitcoin Plunges Ahead Of Blockchain Week; Facebook Eyes Cryptocurrencies by admin · May 11, 2018 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T03:25:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "531134ab1d96291b8e9e5421878baa7dcc48b57c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RTx8pNdCT9V7pkyCNefdFlApv39cnpzNXaFphp9WjKiWHjBP191zWKpUjGJg3J1YJbDm_odbQ3ZKQdzoj7Sbb1acngDJ2WKsaAujf_SGeNqw--", "site_full": "atbitcoin.com", "site": "atbitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "This company lets you buy bitcoin from an ATM.

Wired’s Pump And Dump\nThe fateful day for the publication came about in May 2013 after an experiment with mining Bitcoin on a desktop computer.\nWhile considering what to do with the funds they had collected from the process, the journalists concluded that “the world’s most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction.”\n“So we’re destroying the private key used by our Bitcoin (sic) wallet,” they decided. The journalists then fatefully added:\nThat leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity.\nThe funds linked to the public address provided in the original article currently total 13.35 BTC ($117,000). Lesson Learned (Again): Hodl\nWired’s failure to “hodl” provides a curious window into the mindset of many casual cryptocurrency experimenters at the time.\n“Naturally, our first impulse was to use the Bitcoins to replenish our old pal, Beer Robot, (San Francisco’s Pacific Brewing Laboratory said they’d sell us a keg for BTC 1.5),” the miners wrote on the topic of how to spend the funds. “But that didn’t pass the journalistic ethics sniff test.”\nWhen the private keys were lost forever, BTC/USD was averaging around $115 . Wired continued to receive mining payouts of around 0.02 BTC until the end of 2013.\nWhile the publication has yet to comment on the increasingly widely-circulating faux pas , its efforts still pale in comparison to the infamous Pizza Day episode from 2010.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Pizza Index , even as prices fall under $9,000 on May 11th, the cost of the original $41 order is currently $89,430,000 – or 10,000 BTC.\nWhat do you think about the Wired private key episode?

The public authorities’ intentions may be confronted with a rush towards cryptocurrencies as many Australians won’t take these newly added controls lightly. Australian Government May Trigger Rush to Bitcoin Amid Ban on A$10,000 Cash Payments\nAt the announcement of the Black Economy Standing Taskforce, Australia’s government Treasurer Scott Morrison explained that the commission is preparing a rigorous identification system and mobile strike teams in order to better detect illegal cash transactions. Additionally, the task force will establish a black economy hotline for people to denounce suspicious cash transactions.\n“The Government will introduce a cash payment limit of A$10,000 on payments made to businesses. This will not cover individual-to-individual transactions. The cash limit is aimed at reducing opportunities for criminals to launder the proceeds of crime into goods and services or for businesses to hide transactions to reduce their tax liabilities.”\nThe official document added that the task force will be consulting the community and industry on the most effective way to implement this limit and to consider whether exemptions are warranted. The recommendation to strengthen anti-money laundering laws includes cracking down on unregulated money exchanges.\n“Cash provides an easy, anonymous and largely untraceable mechanism for conducting black economy activity. Cash payments make it easier to under-report income and avoid tax obligations. This allows businesses transacting in cash to undercut competitors and gain a competitive advantage.”\nIn order to extinguish the $50 billion black economy, the Aussie government proposes to ban all cash payments over A$10,000 made to businesses for goods and services from July 1, 2019. Treasurer Morrison explained the effort in his Budget speech.\n“This will be bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax or get a discount for letting someone else cheat on their tax. It’s not clever. It’s not OK. It’s a crime.”\nThe task force also refers to the gig economy as a threat. The government plans to enforce greater scrutiny over workers in the sharing economy, as well as requiring payments into bank accounts instead of cash-in-hand payments, ‘encouraging the transition to a digital society.’\nThe cryptocurrency industry, as the ultimate digital society, offers a number of solutions as the government wishes to exterminate payments in cash. Naturally, a number of individuals that want to steer clear of official economic activity might adopt untraceable digital currencies such as Monero or Zcash . Australians might also turn to Bitcoin et al. for official transactions as people find increasingly few reasons to use fiat money and be subject to the will of the central bank.

But the currency is in a very important place. Actually, Bitcoin is simmering slowly. Will it boil? Will this increase the profits on our hypothetical positions? The Bitcoin market has its undeniable quirks. From the wild volatility of the currency, to a community of developers supporting it, to the fact that Bitcoin can be put in vaults. Putting Bitcoin in “cold vaults” usually means transferring the currency to a storage device without any access to the Internet or any outside networks. But sometimes Bitcoin is put in actual vaults. In an article on Bloomberg, we read : Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune. Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold? Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady. If this seems crazy, then maybe it is. A bit. On the other hand, if you have a sizable position in Bitcoin, then cold storage and, more specifically, an actual vault might be the way to go. This is mostly important for the insurance part of your portfolio . Even if don’t have access to services like Xapo, it might be a good idea to hold part of your coins in cold storage. A simplest idea would be an external USB stick or hard drive without connection to the Internet. The problem with this, of course, is that you have to keep track of where the drive is, unless you can put it in a safe location (e.g. an actual safe) and you have all the same problems you would normally have keeping large amounts of cash at home (risk of robbery, etc.) This is why other kinds of storage services might enjoy some interest in the future. Even if it’s not apparent at first sight, this has implications for Bitcoin traders and investors beyond the insurance part of one’s portfolio. For instance, the fact that 7% of the global Bitcoin supply is held at Xapo, and possibly more in other cold storage services, makes Bitcoin a bit more similar to gold, which has a similar curious characteristic that it’s mostly dug up from the ground only to be stored in vaults. Another implication which can be drawn from this is that it is the investment or speculative trading that determines the price of Bitcoin. In other words, for the time being, the fact that Bitcoin is used as a channel of payments or the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is fixed might not have a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin but rather an indirect impact of honing speculative moods. Bitcoin Tests Retracement and Fails On BitStamp, we’re seeing the rally from around $7,000 to $9,000. It seems that the move lost momentum around $9,500 and the currency moved to $10,000 on relatively small volume. This is a bearish sign, albeit not a particularly strong one. But we have a stronger one in the form of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This level is not a deal breaker, but it currently is the closest level which might have implications for the short-term. First of all, a move above this retracement could result in a short-term rally. This is not what we’re seeing now, though. What we have seen so far is a move above the 38.2% retracement on April 24, 2018, denied one day later, a repeat of the move up on May 3, 2018, and a repeat of the invalidation on May 7, 2018. If you count the move on April 29, 2018, then we have three tests of the 38.2% retracement, all of which failed. The fact that Bitcoin is testing this level relatively frequently suggests that it might be an important one and the failed moves up hint at a possible decline in the weeks to come. One More Factor Comes into Play On the Bitfinex chart, we see that the recent rally brought Bitcoin around $10,000 but the currency stopped at that level. $10,000 is a psychologically important level, a resistance level at this time. The fact that $10,000 stopped the recent move is a bearish indication. But there is more than just $10,000 to the rally. Generally, the rally from $7,000 to $10,000 is seen in proper perspective on the above chart. Bitcoin is above the 78.6% retracement level, which is a slightly bullish indication since this level is not a particularly important one. Perhaps more importantly, the 61.8% retracement level has not been touched and it still acts as a ceiling for the recent move. This is a bearish indication as not much has changed in the last couple of days. There is one more factor that comes into play at the moment. It’s the support line based on the February and March lows. Bitcoin is now quite close to this level. If we see a move below, we might actually get an acceleration of the decline which has been simmering slowly for the last couple of days. Summing up, even thought we’re not seeing much volatility, a small move lower might trigger substantial declines, making the profits on our hypothetical grow even further.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

The prosecutors have conducted searches at the exchange and confiscated computers and accounting records.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Upbit Under Investigation\nSouth Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, the Kakao-backed Upbit is suspected of fraud, according to local media. While maintaining that customers’ assets are still kept securely, the exchange posted the following statement on its website:\nUpbit is currently under investigation by the prosecution, and we are working diligently. Upbit services such as all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.\nUpbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange and the largest in South Korea with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.812 billion at the time of this writing, according to Coinmarketcap. The exchange is affiliated with Kakao Corp which operates the country’s most popular chat app, Kakao Talk. Suspected of Fraud\nCrypto of Korea explained:\nThe company [Upbit] is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account…Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, on charges of fraud.\nAccording to the publication, the financial investigation team of the Seoul Southern District public prosecutors’ office sent prosecutors and investigators to Upbit headquarters on May 10 and May 11 “to secure computer hard disks and accounting records.” More than 10 investigators were sent to Upbit, Money Today added.\n“After the digital forensics investigation on the seizures [seized items] and confirming the illegal charges, we will decide whether and in what direction we will investigate further,” the prosecutors were quoted saying. Accused of Deceiving Customers\nUpbit allegedly “pretends to hold [virtual currencies] without holding virtual currencies,” the news outlet noted.\n“The prosecution believes that Upbit has entered [into] the computer system as if it had virtual currencies that it does not actually own, and deceived customers,” KBS elaborated. According to the prosecution, the Hankyoreh described, “Upbit has been suspected of carrying out ‘book-trading’ without holding virtual currencies in a wallet.”\nThe Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) have been investigating domestic crypto exchanges since March, according to Yonhap News. Their first target was Coinnest where the chairman, Kim Ik-hwan, was detained over embezzlement and fraud charges. According to Money Today, unlike Coinnest, there is no suspicion of embezzlement with Upbit.\nDo you think Upbit is guilty?

Instead, the wallet app will be available for download via Huawei’s app gallery that is pre-installed on Huawei phones.] Did Somebody Say ‘Mass Adoption?’\nBitcoin is set to continue down the path towards mainstream adoption thanks, in no small part, to mobile phone giant Huawei Technologies Co. On Friday, the third largest mobile handset maker in the world will begin affording their users the ability to download Bitcoin wallets on their devices.\nThe announcement comes from BTC.com’s vice president of business operations, Alejandro de la Torre, as the BTC.com wallet is slated to become the first cryptocurrency app offered by Huawei’s AppGallery. Explained de la Torre in a phone interview with Bloomberg :\nIt’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the wallet will be available inHuawei’s AppGallery pre-installed on all phones. Putting Bitcoin in the Palm of Everyone’s Hands\nThis move from Huawei most notably impacts the Chinese market, which doesn’t exactly have a track record of being cryptocurrency friendly.\nDespite interest from Chinese citizens, the country’s government has taken a hardline approach to the buying and selling of Bitcoin, outright banning exchanges earlier this year. However, Chinese citizens are not forbidden from owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nAs noted by Bloomberg , the government of China also blocks Android’s Google Play Store and many sections of Apple’s iTunes, which has effectively served to limit exposure to apps like BTC.com’s cryptocurrency wallet. With Huawei set to provide said wallet to almost all of its users, lack of exposure will no longer be a problem.\nOf course, it’s also worth noting that BTC.com is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies and is in control of the world’s largest mining pool for the dominant cryptocurrency.\nWhat do you think of Huawei putting Bitcoin wallets into the hands of all its users? Do you think providing convenient wallets to the Chinese population will help facilitate mainstream adoption in the crypto-strict country?

The Laborious Fork Activation Will Use the Median Time Earlier Means\nThe BCH fork on Would Possibly 15 will likely be very similar to the fork activations that happened on August 1, and the DAA fork that came about this prior November. this implies the activation will take place on Would Possibly 15, but there gained’t be explicit block height, because the improve will turn on according to ‘Median Time Previous’ (MTP). The initiation of the arduous fork will start on Tuesday, Would Possibly 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade won’t be applied till the MTP timestamp and the processing of eleven blocks equal to or more than 1,526,400,000 takes place. Following this period after the next block, the 32MB upgrade can be continue to exist the BCH community. Complete Node Clients and Miners Should Update Software\nFull node operators wish to upgrade their Bitcoin Money clients as quickly as imaginable, sooner than the fork starts. ABC users can obtain the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 model right here, and people running different full nodes like Bitcoin Limitless, or XT must upgrade to the buyer that supports the 32MB increase. on the second taking a look at information for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a super majority of nodes have already upgraded to the most recent 0.17.1 ABC model. Complete node operators and miners are required to improve their instrument in order to take part all over and after the community change. Extraordinary Customers Must Chorus from Transacting With BCH In The Course Of The Improve and Patiently Watch For the Fork To Complete\nIt’s very best to not transact with BCH in the course of the Would Possibly fifteenth Bitcoin Money improve.\nBizarre customers don’t must do so much of the rest, excluding sustain so far with present occasions in regards to the fork, and its best to not transact throughout the activation length to boot. this means in case you don’t need to ship cash on Would Possibly 15, then wait until the fork is entire sooner than transacting with BCH. It’s always a good degree to seem out for any updates supplied through your trade or pockets provider to make sure that the platform you employ is set to just accept the network adjustments. in case your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s most certainly safe to imagine that the exchange or pockets supplier is ready for the upgrade. So on May 15 if your money is on an change or held inside a non-custodial pockets all you actually need to do is patiently wait till the fork is finished. Remaining November’s A Hit Exhausting Fork Displays There Shouldn’t be Any Headaches\nThe May fifteenth Bitcoin Money fork so that it will modification the protocol’s base block dimension to 32 MB, at the same time as including any other fascinating options might be fairly a milestone for the BCH neighborhood. The last fork that came about this November used to be a success, and the brand new Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has labored perfectly ever on the grounds that. The 32MB building up might be so much better than the already large 8MB blocks, and the upgrade will most likely be a ancient day for public blockchain consensus upgrades.\nWhat do you think that about the fork happening on Would Possibly 15 that allows you to building up the bottom block dimension to 32 MB? let us understand what you’re thinking that approximately this matter in the feedback below.\nImages via Shutterstock, and Pixabay.\nDo you settle with us that Bitcoin is the most efficient invention when you consider that sliced bread?

And add to that the spectre of remaining anonymous, the ecosystem, beset by dreams of easy fortunes and Lambos and glory, was given a real-world object lesson in five short months. Health care, water potability, education, digital rights advocates, among many others, all felt the power and generosity of crypto. This week, Pineapple Fund announced its final donation.\nAlso read: Ethereum Founder Responds to Charges of “Insane”, “Plutocratic” Governance Pineapple Fund Issues its Final Donation\nIn a subreddit post this week, Pineapple Fund’s anonymous benefactor wrote, “It’s been five months, and having just made my last PF donation to the Internet Archive, I figure it might be a good time to say farewell.” Pine, as the anonymous poster goes by, continued by thanking the broader community for offering worthy organization suggestions, and also thanked “the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.”\nThe fund burst upon the crypto community mid-December of last year, right at the height of bitcoin core’s (BTC) price spike. “The anonymous donor says he saw the promise of bitcoin long before it broke the single-digit price range. The donor explains the ‘shattering returns’ of bitcoin over the years has given him more money than he can spend,” these pages documented at the time.\nDonations ranged between $50,000 to $5,000,000. Around since the mid 1980s, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) researches and educates about “the medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana.” It was one of the organizations deemed worthy of a $5mil gift from the fund.\nGive Directly, a group facilitating the ability to send money directly to the extreme poor, also landed among $5mil donations. It claims to distribute 88 percent of each dollar to those in need. Roughly $1,000 is sent to well vetted recipients who often use what is the equivalent in about a year’s wages for essential housing materials. A Strong Legacy\nThe final recipient of $5mil was the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF). Its goal is to both fund and initiate collaborative and groundbreaking research into chronic complex diseases, focusing upon the End ME/CFS Project, designed to find biomarkers and effective treatments for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\n“I kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community,” Pine wrote , “and you could count the number of ‘altcoins’ with one hand. Finding someone else who even knows about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP.”\nCommunity response was effusive with praise such as, “Thank you for doing what so many wish they would do in your position but yet fail to when they get there. Really proud of you and appreciative of your generosity,” one commenter wrote. Still another insisted, “This kind of generosity will indirectly impact so many peoples’ lives for the better. Thank you!”\nOther commenters held onto the idea of Pine returning at some point should the market tick back up again, and prices moon. “Thanks for following along with this experiment. I’m going to say goodbye now, but maybe there’s room for dessert in a few years,” Pine teased. “If you’re ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :)” Of course, others are currently involved in charitable, real-world work, such as Eat BCH . The group doesn’t enjoy the financing of a whale, and yet it provides food relief for countries such as Venezuela, which has suffered greatly in a giant economic downturn.\nIs charity an important way to promote crypto?

The overall market capital in the first quarter was down by 55% with total market capital of cryptocurrencies starting at $572 billion and closing on last day of March at $259 Billion. The markets took big hits ranging from 50% drop in flag-bearer currency to even 80% in specific alternative coins like Bitcoin Cash which dropped from the high of $4100 (Dec 21) to as low as $600 in first week of April. The month of April’ 2018 Considering the whole of month, all major cryptocurrencies showed strength with overall market capital appreciating by 68% closing at $434 billion while BTC market cap was up by 36% ending as green close to $160 billion. Hence, alt-coins were major factors for the respective increase in overall market capitalisation. Bitcoin Historical/Technical Price Analysis BTC formed the basic support around $6,500 by consolidating the whole of first week just above the said level thus, giving investors the confidence required over the repetitive history of April since 2013, observed as the “month of gains” following after the historical red-marked March of every year as well. The “BTC Hodlers” look to have found the historical factor as major reasoning towards the theory of price support as the gaining month of April started. What further? The long-ranged descending line was an important resilient level which the Bulls were finding it hard to get over making up previous three tops which eventually they did. Once the major resistance line was crossed, we saw a momentum upto important overhead resistance of $10,000 where BTC finds the major sentimental resistance. Looking technically the white baseline depicted in charts are major support level for BTC in mid-term range where the initial pull-back started after the major consolidated range given in chart above in the blue oval circle. BTC should ideally move in a positive range with immediate support at $7,800 against which the overhead resistance of $10,200 could be breached in the coming time to test new overhead resistance of $12,000. We believe that the current month of May will be inside a consulted yet inside a positive range of $8,500-$12,000 where if the overhead resistance is crossed, BTC will enter a new bull-run. It is very important for BTC to hold above $7,800 at any given time for a probable pull-again. Ethereum Ether has a strong baseline support at $600 where Bulls will strongly defend levels for a pull-back to overhead resistance. With the exponential moving averages too forming a bullish crossover, it provides the additional strength to the lower levels of support. ETH will continue to be holding it’s pull-back phase that it has entered and a mid-term target of $870 and $995 can be achieved against the baseline support depicted in chart above. If the baseline support if broken, the 2nd largest crypto can plunge back to $485. Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash has been the most positive cryptocurrency considering the month of April with Bitpay including BCH as part of their payment channels and the rising consensus towards the BCH hard fork happening on 15th of this month. BCH looks to gain positivity over a period of time and the most important support areas where bulls find interest are just between the levels of $1,100 and $1,350 against which mid-ranged traders and long term investors too find in confidence. BCH is likely to stay positive above the mentioned support and as mentioned in our previous weekly reports, it is still expected to breach the mid-term overhead resistance of $1,780 to test newer resistance in coming time. Our analysis will be invalidated if BCH falls below $1,100 which seems unlikely. Market Updates 1. The second Wall-Street giant owner is mulling letting customers buy and hold bitcoin. The news immediately came after one of giant investment banking firm Goldman Sachs executive confirmed about getting into the launching of “Bitcoin Futures” within weeks. 2. Morgan Stanley Bank showed its interest in hiring new talent from the field of cryptocurrency world on their stock research. Unlike other wall-street heads, the Chief of Morgan Stanley rather has an optimistic view about Bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrencies. 3. Thus, looking into these Traditional Financial Institutions having hinted their high interests towards Cryptocurrency trading, it will be interesting to see which one will eventually be the beginner of the new era of this launch where NYSE, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays are showing positive interests. 4. Zebpay launched two more ERC20 tokens on its trading platform last week being Ox(ZRX) and Augur(REP) token where the data shows that it garnered a lot of users interest. Globally, both the respective currencies shot up in prices for about 20% recently post their launch on the native platform The announcement of REP getting launched on Binance today fuelled in another 40% positive momentum in just a couple of hours which didn’t last long. 5. A new latest research by Fundstrat shows “Mining will propel Bitcoin price to $36,000 by 2019. The calculations focused on Bitcoin price to Mining Breakeven Cost Metric, known as P/BE, which Doctor says has “proven a reliable long-term support level. Price Analysis Volume Analysis The outrageous surge in BCH volumes is backed by rising consensus in protocol update and addition of Bitcoin Cash as payments by Bitpay as we previously mentioned in our weekly analysis as well.

Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop Tokyo Bitcoin Whale Strikes Again: Mt. Gox Bankruptcy Trustee to Blame for Latest Bitcoin Price Drop On May 11, 2018 Share\nReports have emerged that the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi is gearing up for another round of bitcoin selling. According to Blockchain.info, 8,200 BTC was moved from the fund’s cold wallet. In response, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $9,000 over fears the coins may be sold on the online exchange market and not on OTC platforms. Bitcoin Falls Below $9,000 in the Wake of Latest Mt. Gox Selloff\nBitcoin has been on a high over the last three weeks. From having its first consecutive weekly gains, the number one crypto appeared to be on the resurgence. In the last few days, negative comments from Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and now reports of another substantial Mt. Gox selloff seems to be affecting the bitcoin price. The transfers are reported to have occurred in the early hours of May 10.\nSeveral crypto monitors are accusing the Mt. Gox trustee of dumping the coins on the exchange market. These reports are still unconfirmed, but some commentators say it is a way of shorting the market. According to Cryptoground , the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trust still has a balance of 137, 891 BTC. Cryptoground is a website that monitors the cold wallet of the defunct platform’s bankruptcy trust. Kobayashi earlier said that he planned to sell the remaining Mt. Gox crypto holdings over the coming months. Someone please tell the drunk Mt. Gox trustee person to stop using cryptocurrency exchanges and move to the over-the-counter market.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 11, 2018 Charting the Effect of Past Selloffs on Bitcoin Prices\nIn March 2018, Kobayashi denied that his sale of $400 million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash caused the prices to crash. Bitcoin rose in value in late 2017 almost eclipsing the $20,000 in mid-December. By the start of February 2018, the crypto had plunged to below $6,000. Many were quick to point fingers at the trustee who in his defense said sales took place on OTC avenues.\nNevertheless, many argued that OTC buyers could immediately dump bitcoin on online exchanges, inducing panic and causing the price to plummet. Indeed, careful examination of some online exchanges shows a spike in bitcoin sell orders in the immediate aftermath of Mt. Gox selloffs. There is no denying the fact that significant price corrections have occurred in the wake of all Mt. Gox selloffs.\nMt. Gox was once the most prominent Bitcoin exchange until it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after suffering a series of hacks.\nDo you think the Mt. Gox selloffs are affecting the bitcoin price?

Many individuals appear to not perceive the distinction between authorized tender and authorized forex. Bitcoin is a authorized forex in Japan, South Korea, and Philippines, it’s authorized to make use of it as a forex. Authorized tender means it’s unlawful to not settle for it as cash, it have to be accepted. — Joseph Younger (@iamjosephyoung) May 11, 2018 SOV could have its token sale beginning within the third quarter of 2018 and cash will likely be capped at 24 million SOV, in keeping with Minister-in-Help to the President & Setting Minister of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The federal government has no plans to finish fiat cash within the close to future. SOV will be complementary to the US dollar, the country’s only legal tender since 1982. “Whereas there may be comprehensible concern by policymakers and regulators worldwide of the misuse of cryptocurrencies for tax evasion, cash laundering, and terrorist financing, the SOV is designed on goal to be unusable for these functions.” Minister Paul added that SOV will act like common cash in Marshall Islands, which alleviates the regulatory uncertainty for companies and people. “This creates authorized certainty for its use, as a result of all jurisdictions have legal guidelines in place for coping with authorized tender, whereas non-public cryptocurrencies are handled otherwise in several jurisdictions. It was clear that there was an enormous market want for a non-anonymous blockchain system that may function inside a regulated atmosphere.” Behind the creation of the proprietary digital forex is Neema, an Israeli fintech firm headed by Chief Govt Officer Ben-Ezer who was the primary to suggest the concept to the island nation. The corporate has primarily based its enterprise on its app that helps individuals handle their cash in addition to ship cash to different individuals. Ben-Ezer will now be partly accountable for proving to the world that cryptocurrencies are actual alternate options to fiat cash in a market financial system. He expects a world impression from this as it could set off a chain reaction on how cryptocurrencies are viewed and regulated . Equally to KYC strategies employed by exchanges, individuals wishing to purchase SOV tokens within the preliminary coin providing should totally determine themselves with a authorities ID and a biometric marker, so every pockets is related to an identification token. SOV will quickly be out there for buy at exchanges and vacationers are additionally welcomed to accumulate them.

The price seems to have reacted, marking a slight increase.\nAt press time, ETH was trading for $761.86 which is roughly a 2% price increase over the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap . The slight price improvement could be attributed to the news that the first version of the planned Casper update was released on Tuesday, May 8 th. Ethereum’s Scalability Issues\nIt goes without saying that Ethereum has managed to establish itself as the predominant platform for the development of Decentralized Applications (DApps). Nevertheless, scalability issues have pushed developers towards identifying appropriate alternatives, choosing platforms such as Stellar or NEO.\nThe Ethereum blockchain is currently using the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. It requires a substantial amount of computational power to boast satisfying performance. It can currently process between 7 to 15 transactions per second, which is quite low. NEO’s transaction speed, for example, is a much faster 1,000 TPS.\nTo their credit, Ethereum’s development team hasn’t shied away from the problem. Addressed through an update known as Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) introduced back in October, 2017, the team seeks to remedy the issue. First Release Rolled Out\nOn May 8 th , Danny Ryan, the lead developer of the Casper FFG submitted the first release of the long-awaited update on GitHub.\nThe main proposition of Casper FFG is layering the Friendly Finality Gadget on top of an existing PoW block as a step towards the transition to a fully-fledged Proof of Stake network. This particular Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) was introduced back on April 20 th .\nA substantial specification of the EIP is that it reduces the block reward for miners. From the current 3 ETH, it shall drop down to 0.6 ETH in an attempt to push the blockchain away from the issues which are associated with mining. It’s worth noting, though, that the new PoW block reward won’t be instantly changed to 0.6 but it shall be reduced gradually over the course of roughly one year, according to the aforementioned EIP.\nThe EIP reads:\nThrough the use of Ether deposits, slashing conditions, and a modified fork choice, FFG allows the underlying PoW blockchain to be finalized. As network security is greatly shifted from PoW to PoS, PoW block rewards are reduced.\nDo you think Casper FFG will enable Ethereum to handle its current scalability issues?

Processing power to guess the solution is known as \"hash power,\" which Fundstrat predicts will grow 350 percent through 2019.\n\"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report.\nPerformance of bitcoin over the last 12 months\n© Provided by CNBC Bitcoin traded near $9,300 midday Thursday. Last year, the cryptocurrency surged from less than $1,000 to above $19,000, helped by a flood of investor interest. Concerns about regulatory crackdown have helped send prices lower so far this year.\nHowever, the economics of bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said. He said bitcoin miners are more likely to hold bitcoin as its price falls to break-even for operating costs, and sell as its price rises, leading to greater profits.\n\"The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,\" Doctor said during a conference call Thursday.\nMining depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, cooling equipment and specialized hardware, known as rigs.\nAs of May 6, Fundstrat estimates the cash break-even price for the older Antminer S7 model is $6,003 per bitcoin, and $2,368 for the newer Antminer S9. Both are made by Beijing-based Bitmain, which Bernstein analysts estimate made $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profits last year.\n\"The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,\" Doctor said.\nFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin. He issued his first formal report on the cryptocurrency last July, when bitcoin traded near $2,540. At the time, Lee predicted bitcoin could become a substitute for gold and reach $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cnbc.com/id/104573311?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=105199231", "http://www.cnbc.com/id/104887499?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=105199231", "http://cnbc.com/", "http://www.cnbc.com/id/105023376?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=105199231"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evelyn cheng", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saint hyacinthe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T05:50:24.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6010a5182d0079e77ec5b22a03d104dc49c7ad7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJcxGIcSYozvZnXFFC8afFLCaBiuGbDEtXg6EzIhkBuUAwgoW3kqBiGgMT.EXL6Ctvee2am7LhbTqpQ6n8ggJ_LlH5QjBOQ0aOPLpTRloxyQj5XpJCkkdj4M0ppKiumOeo-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "https://www.marketwatch.com/topics/journalists/rachel-koning-beals?prop=location&propval=eu", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Rachel Koning Beals - MarketWatch.com Topics", "title": "Why a raid in a South Korean crypto-exchange rattled the wider bitcoin market - MarketWatch", "title_full": "Why a raid in a South Korean crypto-exchange rattled the wider bitcoin market - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.033, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY667_bitcoi_ZG_20171120073849.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 42, "comments": 0, "shares": 42}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6010a5182d0079e77ec5b22a03d104dc49c7ad7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJcxGIcSYozvZnXFFC8afFLCaBiuGbDEtXg6EzIhkBuUAwgoW3kqBiGgMT.EXL6Ctvee2am7LhbTqpQ6n8ggJ_LlH5QjBOQ0aOPLpTRloxyQj5XpJCkkdj4M0ppKiumOeo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why a raid in a South Korean crypto-exchange rattled the wider bitcoin market - MarketWatch", "text": "Reports of a police raid on one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in one of the most cryptocrazy countries has rippled through the digital-currency market over the past 24 hours.\nThe exchange known as UPbit—South Korea’s largest crypto platform—has been accused of selling cryptocurrency it doesn’t hold, according to local news outlet Chosun . “We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation.

He points to the popular cryptocurrency’s resurgence as a sign of its durability.\nKelly offered his views on Bitcoin at the Hoover Institute Monetary Policy Conference. Describing the currency as a serious market , he insisted that things are changing, adding that discussions about cryptocurrency rarely took place at previous established financial conferences. Bitcoin certainly got people talking at this one, however. No longer niche\nKelly said that digital currency could no longer be considered niche, now that its audience has grown beyond its core crypto base. Mainstream finance is beginning to take Bitcoin seriously , which suggests that the market has become a hard one to ignore. Kelly said that the attention being given to Bitcoin is well deserved, now that the market cap for cryptocurrency has reached $460bn.\nThe CEO also said that Goldman Sachs’ recent moves in the Bitcoin market is evidence of a change in perception. The Wall Street bankers recently confirmed that it would be trading both Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures in the coming months. Goldman Sachs would be the first company on Wall Street to trade cryptocurrency. The real deal\nWhen it comes to an asset class being perceived as a viable vehicle for investment, legitimacy is vital. Rana Yared, an executive from Goldman Sachs, has vouched for Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Such confidence from a respected firm like Sachs only serves to enhance the virtual currency’s reputation among mainstream investors. There have also been reports of a Chinese investor having purchased 10,000 Bitcoins in a bear run earlier this year.\nIt isn’t just Wall Street where Bitcoin is being embraced, however. The increased adoption of Bitcoin by online and offline merchants will further encourage the general public to learn what it is, how it works, and how it can be used. While it can seem confusing at first, sites such as bitcoins.net aim to inject some clarity into the subject through its series of guides. With its already growing popularity, along with such readily available information to help its immersion into the mainstream, Bitcoin is looking more and more like a force to be reckoned with, both in the short-term and long-term. SEC takes notice\n“ Bitcoin, bitcoin coin, physical bitcoin, ” ( CC BY-SA 2.0 ) by antanacoins\nWith such bodies as the SEC (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) sitting up and taking notice, the general belief is that Bitcoin is largely free from regulatory troubles. Kelly said that this is a factor in the increased price of the cryptocurrency. Reports suggest that the SEC is looking into whether some alt coins are valid securities. Kelly believes that, as for Bitcoin, there’s no doubt that it’s a currency.

Bitcoin Miners Do the Selling\nAccording to independent research boutique Fundstrat, which provides market strategy and sector research, the bitcoin mining boom could potentially send the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization to upwards of $64,000 USD by the end of 2019. States the company’s head of research, Sam Doctor, in a report:\nWe believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range.\nBitcoin is infamously volatile, creating FOMOers and naysayers on what feels like a weekly basis. Nevertheless, Fundstrat believes the economics behind bitcoin mining create key support levels — since bitcoin miners are less likely to sell their rewards during market downturns, and more likely to cash out during bull runs. Explained Doctor in a conference call to CNBC on Thursday:\nThe primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors. We believe breakeven mining costs provide a support level for $BTC , as #miners – main natural #Crypto sellers – reduce selling at low $BTCUSD price. Based on expected computing hashpower and breakeven cost growth, that could imply #Bitcoin price of $36,000 by 2019 year end. pic.twitter.com/CVwIWNz8Lr\n— Sam Doctor (@fundstratQuant) May 10, 2018\nFundstrat has estimated that the current cash break-even price Antminer S7 models is $6,003 USD per bitcoin. The newer and more powerful Antminer S9 , however, features a much lower break-even point at $2,368 USD. Both popular pieces of bitcoin mining hardware are manufactured by Bitmain, which boasted an operating profit between 3 billion USD to 4 billion USD in 2017. Doctor said:\nThe release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.

Kelly is Shocked\nEarlier this week, as CCN reported, NYSE’s mother or father firm ICE Change has been creating and testing a bitcoin change to serve buyers from the standard finance sector. Numerous stories revealed that ICE Change just isn’t launching a futures market like CME and CBOE, quite a correct bitcoin change on which buyers should purchase, promote, and retailer bitcoin instantly.\n“The mother or father firm of the New York Inventory Change has been engaged on an internet buying and selling platform that may permit massive buyers to purchase and maintain Bitcoin, in keeping with emails and paperwork seen by The New York Occasions and 4 folks briefed on the hassle who requested to stay nameless as a result of the plans had been nonetheless confidential,” the New York Occasions reported.\nKelly emphasised that whereas he’s “shocked” the cryptocurrency market didn’t surge in worth based mostly on the doorway of NYSE into the market, he said that buyers have missed out on an essential ingredient, which is that like Xapo and Coinbase, NYSE and its mother or father firm ICE Change will begin to function a custody resolution for institutional holders. The operator of the NYSE is planning to help bitcoin buying and selling.\n“I’m truly a bit shocked that the market didn’t choose up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC stated that buyers will get bodily supply of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that attention-grabbing aside from the truth that it means ICE Change has a custody resolution. That has been the large hurdle. How do you maintain onto these belongings. These are usually bearer devices, identical to gold bearer bonds. That’s the large deal. They’ve provide you with a custody resolution for institutional holders,” stated Kelly.\nHe additional famous that the event of a bitcoin custody resolution by ICE Change signifies cryptocurrencies have turn out to be an rising asset class. Extra importantly, Kelly added that the expansion of cryptocurrencies as an rising asset class will permit multi-billion greenback pensions, endowment, and institutional buyers to put money into the cryptocurrency market.\n“Lastly, it opens the door for pensions and endowments. Up so far, it has been very troublesome for them to get snug compliance sensible in holding cryptocurrency. If ICE has a custodian resolution that’s SEC compliant, that’s going to open the floodgates,” Kelly added. What Will Floodgates Look Like?\nThe cryptocurrency market has turn out to be a $zero.5 trillion market with barely any capital from institutional buyers, endowments, and pensions. If institutional buyers start to enter the cryptocurrency market with tens of billions of dollars in new capital, it can permit the cryptocurrency market to develop at a tempo that’s incomparable to its development charge previously. It may allow the cryptocurrency market to evolve right into a multi-trillion greenback market, as many buyers have anticipated since 2016.\nPictures from Shutterstock.\nComply with us on Telegram.

The Identity Crisis for Initial Coin Offerings\nAaron Kaplan, securities attorney and COO of Prometheum, is guest author for this Opinion/Editorial.\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become the investment du jour while the understanding of what ICOs are has become desperately convoluted. Every huckster, scammer and opportunist has tried to hop on the bandwagon. (I’m talking to you, Casey Ryback) Many of these ICOs were a means for scammers to raise money over the internet from unsophisticated investors whose “FOMO” outweighed the obvious red flags associated with such offerings.\nAlso read: Ver’s Sci-Fi Novel Life, Voorhees Buys Tucker’s Tie for $27k Identity Crisis for Initial Coin Offerings\nThe rapid growth of the ICO industry ($6+ billion) and the inherent scams and related investor losses forced the SEC to consider ICOs in the context of the Federal Securities Laws (FSLs). The SEC’s recent broad subpoena sweep marked the SEC’s official declaration that ICOs are securities. Now that ICOs must comply with the FSLs, it should come as no surprise that a new type of trickster is trying to hijack the innovation through either a) selling illiquid tokens to wealthy investors or b) selling traditional securities that are registered on a blockchain. To set the record straight, and provide much needed clarity, here is a condensed description of ICOs and their intended benefit. ICOs are an innovative means of capital formation. Issuers offer a securitization of user interest in an ecosystem as an investment to the general public. Assuming the issuer has reasonable token economics, then the greater the user interest in the ecosystem, and the utility of the underlying token, the more the value of such token should increase. It’s supply and demand, but the price is not reflected in the common stock; rather, it is reflected in the cryptographic token representing the user interest. Aaron Kaplan\nFurthermore, an ICO should have two key features: 1. It should be available to the general public, and 2. It should be able to freely trade on the secondary market when the token is issued. The securities of ICOs to date have not and cannot achieve both those goals. Such securities are illiquid and only available to accredited investors/institutions. As the industry matures through compliance with all relevant rules and regulations, I fear we are losing the spirit of ICOs, which some argue may not be sustainable under the FSLs. Issue 1: Reg D/SAFT ICOs\nThe Filecoin Reg D token offering in mid-2017 was an important point for honoring the Federal Securities Laws. Reg D ICOs raise capital with proper offering documents (a requirement under the FSLs) by selling tokens that have proposed utility in an ecosystem. While such ICOs are legal by nature, companies conducting ICOs in a Reg D (or a SAFT) offering forgot how an ICO was supposed to function.\nThese Reg D and SAFT ICOs inherently contradict the spirit of an ICO- a token sale that should be open to all investors (both accredited and non-accredited), and freely trading in the secondary market. Reg D and SAFT issuers’ token sales are only open to accredited investors (i.e. wealthy individuals and institutions) and are restricted securities (meaning they can’t trade freely on the secondary market until the issuer files current public information and essentially registers such securities with the SEC).\nThese issuers, while understanding that ICOs are securitizations of user interest, missed the mark. Their ICOs are illiquid and limit participation to the wealthy. Investors won’t have the ability to trade those tokens, and are stuck with illiquid (untradeable) securities that have the same issues as those associated with traditional venture funding – waiting for a buyout event or going public (which is extremely rare) before investors can realize a return on their investment. Issue 2: ICOs vs. Traditional Securities Issued Over a Blockchain\nOpportunistic companies are also trying to use the concept of an ICO, turning an innovative method of monetizing an ecosystem into a cheap marketing ploy. The most frustrating example of this practice are companies who say they are raising capital for an ICO, but in reality they are just issuing traditional equity or debt securities that are represented by a cryptographic token. These aren’t ICOs, but rather traditional securities registered (like a transfer agent’s log) over a blockchain. While many (including me) believe blockchain securities are the future of securities ownership, a preferred equity token is not an ICO. It is a traditional security that is issued over a blockchain.\nSecurities issued over a blockchain MUST be distinguished from ICOs. An appropriate definition of an ICO in 2018 is the following: an ICO is a securitization of user interest. It is not a debt or equity security, but rather a new type of security – an investment whose value is related to the user’s interest in an ecosystem and the utility of the actual token in that ecosystem. It is essential that the industry understands the difference. In late March, a company tried to issue a blockchain security for a building. Such cryptographic tokens represent ownership in the building and trade over blockchain. That is a traditional Reg D security, and not an ICO. The company received news coverage for being the first company to sell interests in a building using a blockchain. However, many companies have sold interests in real property online. This company is doing the same thing – basically putting lipstick on a pig. So how do we define an ICO?\nICOs are innovative ways to unleash/monetize potential value from the user interest in an ecosystem. ICO tokens represent a new type of security whose value is related to the user appetite in that ecosystem (daily average use, recurring use, etc.). Ideally, an ICO should be available to all types of investors (accredited and non-accredited) and be freely tradable when the underlying network goes live. With ICOs officially coming under the FSLs regime, the industry should take a moment to reflect on what an ICO is and will be under the FSLs before it morphs from a genuine innovation into a marketing ploy.

Furthermore, Electrum Pro is advertising on Google AdWords, in an apparent attempt to divert traffic from the legitimate wallet service.\nLong considered one of the most user-friendly and secure wallets, with compatibility for hardware including Trezor and Ledger, the team behind the service now claim scammers are effectively running malware designed to steal BTC from the domain.\nTheir concern is that any wallets created on the electrum.com domain are now compromised, further undermining confidence in BTC and potentially cryptocurrencies as a whole.\nHaving identified the suspected malware, the Electrum team outlined their findings on Github, reflecting the relevant code for stealing recovery seeds, and passing the required information to the scammers. This enables the hackers to take control of user wallets, and any of the funds contained within them, according to the Electrum team.\nThe incident is not the first time hackers have attempted to copy Electrum and pass off as the legitimate platform, but comes as the first instance of a hacker being able to use the .com domain.\nThe .com website is also difficult to detect as a scam, with only subtle differences from the legitimate Electrum site, and the claim that Electrum Pro is a fork from the original. The Linux version of the wallet remains uncompromised, with only Windows and OS X versions containing the malicious code.\nElectrum has advised anyone who has recently installed their platform to double check they’ve installed the correct, legitimate version, available only from Electrum.org. There are also plans to create an official app, available for download from the Mac App Store, as a means of circumventing similar attacks in future.\nNevertheless, the development is only the latest of many hacking attempts revolving around BTC.\nEarlier this week, a research report documented findings from a year-long study that showed anywhere from between 3-10x the malicious activity on the BTC blockchain as the public Internet, with BTC dubbed ‘3x more evil than the Internet’. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

Processing power to guess the solution is known as \"hash power,\" which Fundstrat predicts will grow 350 percent through 2019.\n\"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report.\nPerformance of bitcoin over the last 12 months\n© Provided by CNBC Bitcoin traded near $9,300 midday Thursday. Last year, the cryptocurrency surged from less than $1,000 to above $19,000, helped by a flood of investor interest. Concerns about regulatory crackdown have helped send prices lower so far this year.\nHowever, the economics of bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said. He said bitcoin miners are more likely to hold bitcoin as its price falls to break-even for operating costs, and sell as its price rises, leading to greater profits.\n\"The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,\" Doctor said during a conference call Thursday.\nMining depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, cooling equipment and specialized hardware, known as rigs.\nAs of May 6, Fundstrat estimates the cash break-even price for the older Antminer S7 model is $6,003 per bitcoin, and $2,368 for the newer Antminer S9. Both are made by Beijing-based Bitmain, which Bernstein analysts estimate made $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profits last year.\n\"The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,\" Doctor said.\nFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin. He issued his first formal report on the cryptocurrency last July, when bitcoin traded near $2,540. At the time, Lee predicted bitcoin could become a substitute for gold and reach $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cnbc.com/id/104573311?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=105199231", "http://www.cnbc.com/id/104887499?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=105199231", "http://www.cnbc.com/", "http://www.cnbc.com/id/105023376?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=105199231"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evelyn cheng", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saint hyacinthe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:09:38.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc58ce42ae376989b4e8662ab99e0371c693eb62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUuIVrIb9IQS_mwQ_kESQlECzRQD0eRSufcf.AUU8A_pbbDTk.mFI3ThI3VYWEXZevF1u_fBQU0xuiC7yr3.NYNgvb2wk3Z.7Xd0uLObfEorlFbBs5hLGuCKQqfBUE5I92I5WevdV9vdvbmwlFQr1DQtlo1StI.ZpLXsGUceT6_jw--", "site_full": "news.morningstar.com", "site": "morningstar.com", "site_section": "http://news.morningstar.com/all/source/business-wire.aspx", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Press Releases Archive: BusinessWire", "title": "AML BitCoin (ABTC) Listed On Exrates Cryptocurrency Exchange", "title_full": "AML BitCoin (ABTC) Listed On Exrates Cryptocurrency Exchange", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc58ce42ae376989b4e8662ab99e0371c693eb62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUuIVrIb9IQS_mwQ_kESQlECzRQD0eRSufcf.AUU8A_pbbDTk.mFI3ThI3VYWEXZevF1u_fBQU0xuiC7yr3.NYNgvb2wk3Z.7Xd0uLObfEorlFbBs5hLGuCKQqfBUE5I92I5WevdV9vdvbmwlFQr1DQtlo1StI.ZpLXsGUceT6_jw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "morningstar.com", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "AML BitCoin (ABTC) Listed On Exrates Cryptocurrency Exchange", "text": "AML BitCoin (ABTC) Listed On Exrates Cryptocurrency Exchange\nNAC Foundation, LLC, creator of the AML BitCoin (ABTC) – a patented AML/KYC compliant digital currency – is proud to announce it has commenced trading on its second digital currency exchange – Exrates .\nMarcus Andrade, CEO of NAC Foundation, expressed his satisfaction with the listing of ABTC on Exrates. “With our successful trading launch on IDAX, we entered a new phase in the development of our digital currency.

Play2Live has signaled that it plans to launch the Level Up Chain Testnet during July 2018.\nThe key advantage of Level Up Chain is the ability to potentially provide unlimited bandwidth for its users. The main network (main net) will be able to process up to 500 transactions per second. Due to the wide functionality of the Play2Live platform, transactions corresponding to different services will be allocated in different functional blocks of the network. Therefore, sub-chains with a capacity of 500 TPS for each functional block of the platform will be essential to scaling the network to accommodate for millions of active users. With the use of sub chains, the entire Level Up Chain infrastructure will be able to provide 100,000 TPS or more and will carry out transactions almost instantly, even during periods of enormous strain like live broadcasts and esports tournaments. The cost of transactions within Level Up Chain will be minimal, and the team at Play2Live estimates that the fees will be maintained at $0.01 per transaction.\nIn addition to that, Level Up Chain will use consensus protocol to reduce the cost of transactions within the network via special certificates. The number of certificates issued will be hashed and stored in a multidimensional “matrix”, which will change due to certificates growth or decrease. Each node will be given a “trust code”, allowing to enter one vector into the matrix. The code will contain the encryption of the input vector including registry information and code identifier contained in the block, forming a hash, which is again translated into a vector. That makes it impossible to predict vector’s direction based on the input signal.\nAs a result, the network will use encrypted number of certificates, not single transactions, where a single transaction will receive one or thousands of certificates. This indicator will assign corresponding status to the matrix. Each verifying node transaction will exchange codes with other nodes, that have properties of the opposite side of the matrix, after a certain number of cycles. Thanks to that, a single transaction will transfer a lot of vectors, significantly reducing the load on the network. In the meanwhile, consensus algorithm will solve the problems of processing power, giving each node an equal chance of being selected for transaction confirmation process.\nThe platform plans to attract more than 5M users by the end of 2018 – first quarter of 2019. Play2Live aims to achieve this goal by working with content providers, as well as collaborating with the world’s leading streamers and esports tournament organizers around the globe. Some of the first major tournaments on the platform are soon to be announced. Through its exposure to esports and live video streaming, some of the fastest growing markets in the world, Level Up Chain has the potential to become one of the leading blockchain platforms for live streaming and esports.\nVladislav Arbatov, CTO at Play2Live:\n“Working on Bitshares, we have faced complex scaling and risks of ‘bottleneck’ as the functionality of the platform expanded, and the amount of transactions increased. The peak power of Bitshares is not enough to cover all the activities of Play2Live.That is why we are realizing product architecture that will allow us to scale the project without putting it to risk of depending on the capacity of the third-party blockchain.”\nAlexey Burdyko, CEO and founder at Play2Live:\n“Play2Live offers numerous tools for users. Each of them will be provided by our own reliable Level Up Chain blockchain. This will allow us to scale the platform and realize a huge number of opportunities unprecedented for the esports market!”\nAbout Play2Live\nFounded in 2017, Play2Live aims to merge blockchain technology with streaming services. Its mission is to create an ecosystem where every participant – the viewer, the streamer, and the esports tournament organizer – is part of a seamless system that favors interaction among viewers and the diversity of monetization schemes. Everybody can be part of the peer-to-peer interaction, and everybody, even the viewer, is able to earn money.\nPlay2Live uses a token called Level Up Coin (LUC) which acts as a sole internal mean of payment within the system. It can be easily converted to other cryptocurrencies, or to fiat money through a special exchange service/API.\nPlay2Live achieved hard-cap of sales, raising $30M. During a pre-sale event that took place January 26th – February 6th, 2018 $18M were raised, remaining $12M were raised during the main sales event on February 26 th – March 14 th , 2018.\nSign up for the MVP of the streaming platform here: https://p2l.tv/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "charts, guides & analysis sponsored", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "limassol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:21:42.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5166190eb2c9c574db4fdd7c85d377dee5fc2cbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwWdHMT04Z.6e6zJsC1ck.dNvtMi0m7ciVkGTIB8X7yE1s5A5FPexFrLq0P.OCu1xRygBtVdJrYsEjnl7pdq7YkmL_RliGSCEOHYdvsX7hCdUdIwue6LFQ", "site_full": "theicojournal.com", "site": "theicojournal.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "", "title": "Trading Crypto: **Friday Morning: Bitcoin Isn’t Your Friend Right Now - The ICO Journal - Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin, Coin News", "title_full": "Trading Crypto: **Friday Morning: Bitcoin Isn’t Your Friend Right Now - The ICO Journal - Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin, Coin News", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://theicojournal.com/wp-content/uploads/C6920BBB-67A7-4732-829E-6FCFC8C01A3E.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5166190eb2c9c574db4fdd7c85d377dee5fc2cbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwWdHMT04Z.6e6zJsC1ck.dNvtMi0m7ciVkGTIB8X7yE1s5A5FPexFrLq0P.OCu1xRygBtVdJrYsEjnl7pdq7YkmL_RliGSCEOHYdvsX7hCdUdIwue6LFQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rogue Trader", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trading Crypto: **Friday Morning: Bitcoin Isn’t Your Friend Right Now - The ICO Journal - Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin, Coin News", "text": "/ in Article: Guides and Explanations , Article: News , Article: Trading / by Rogue Trader\nBitcoin has been trending down for the last 20 hours, and as of now has no end in sight for the near-term. Why? Consider that almost every candle on the 4-hour scale for that last 20 hours or so has been red. Supports have been broken with ease, and Rogue* Wave Pattern has played out to perfect harmony with the movement in the last few days. Looking at the daily chart, we can see the clear cross in MACD to indicate that BTC still had not unleashed it’s true downside. Keep in mind as BTC has had an excellent bull run, this giveback is to be expected and is normal. Where it stops will be key. As shown in the last several days’ charts, the Rogue* Wave Analysis showed BTC attempting to seek out the mid to lower 8k levels at the least. Currently, BTC is trading around 8500. Taking a look at the current Rogue model as well, a clear path is given to the daily candles to test 8800, then 8k. Candle close* is what counts. Lets take a look at the tech specs. MACD has crossed and is ticking negatively on literally every scale. Daily currently shows that downward momentum will continue. Stochastic levels and getting low daily and seeking oversold(<20) once again, however 4-hour is something to watch as it has been in low levels for a while and seeks to try and bottom. Watch in the next 12-24 hours. BTC is currently a No Play. Capital Conservation and Risk Management should have been utilized, and should continue to be applied in these market conditions. Futures Traders – Trade the Trend. The short-term trend is down.

Daily chart\nThe above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $9,149 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement), pushing indicators into bearish territory.\nFor instance, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and opening the doors for a further drop in prices.\nThe 5-day MA and the 10-day MA are both trending south, having witnessed a bearish crossover earlier this week. 4-hour chart\nOn the 4-hour chart, BTC has breached the trendline support in a convincing manner, and the 50-candle and 100-candle MAs have topped out (shed bullish bias).\nThe cryptocurrency looks set to test the gradually ascending (mildly bullish) 200-candle MA located just above the $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, seen in the daily chart). However, the moving average support may hold ground for a few hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions. 1-hour chart\nThe 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are trending south and positioned one below the other in favor of the bears. Yet, the RSI on the 60-minute chart also shows oversold conditions. So, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out. View Bitcoin will likely break below $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), signaling the end of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 and may fall to $8,282 (50-day MA) at the weekend. BTC could revisit $9,000 as indicated by the oversold conditions 0n the 4- and 1-hour charts. That said, upticks will likely be short-lived as indicated by generally bearish setup. Bearish invalidation scenario: A rebound from the mildly bullish 200-candle MA located at $8,628 in 4-hour chart and a close above 10-day MA of $9,390 would abort the bearish view.\nBitcoin and chart image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2 How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization\nDecentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC. Meritocracy\nA meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.”\nThere’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”.\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHealthy Competition is the Way Forward This is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn’t benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence.\nInstead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball Jonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

According to the report, the company made $289 Million — 9% of their total revenue — from sales to cryptocurrency miners.\nNvidia expected to make $200 Million through cryptocurrency sales but made nearly 50% more. Though their crypto sales has outperformed their expectations, they expect it to come down in the coming months. With ethereum being the most popular cryptocurrency being mined on GPUs, Bitmain is expected to take a significant portion of chip-related market share when the Antminer E3 launches later this year.\nIn fact, Bitmain reported more revenue last year than Nvidia, whose product line also includes components for cloud computing and AI. Nvidia reported $3 Billion in operating profit for the year, while Bitmain made nearly $4 Billion selling ASIC miners.\nThough Nvidia might not have the revenue of Bitmain, they made more crypto hardware sales than their GPU rival AMD. AMD reported first-quarter revenue of $1.65 Billion out of which 10% was crypto sales, indicating they made only $165 Million. Like Nvidia, AMD also expects mining revenue to decline in the coming days.\nJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, explained:\n“The reason why they bought [GPU cards] is for gaming, but while they are not gaming; while they are at school, at work, or in bed — they will turn it on and do a little mining. There’s nothing wrong with that.”\nWhen the demand for consumer GPUs for cryptocurrency mining shot through the roof, Nvidia tried controlling the sales and ultimately failed. In some markets, retailers sell these graphics cards for as much as twice their actual cost because of the demand. However, the firm appears to have finally come to terms with cryptocurrencies, and the upcoming ASIC Miner from Bitmain might finally free up their supply constraints.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nvidia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu manufacturer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antminer e3", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cryptocurren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:02:59.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee1d10f97b17e613547ad49f4282f0d158c592df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54MXpDkm9lE_n5TdEYPgjr.Q7VJqsisdTa7f4lJ6m9XTJFGjBpfEnVdJ7usGvObEnQF_xEpumBZ5z", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Mission Accomplished: Pineapple Fund Bids Farewell After $55M in Bitcoin Donations - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Mission Accomplished: Pineapple Fund Bids Farewell After $55M in Bitcoin Donations - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_370287722.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee1d10f97b17e613547ad49f4282f0d158c592df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54MXpDkm9lE_n5TdEYPgjr.Q7VJqsisdTa7f4lJ6m9XTJFGjBpfEnVdJ7usGvObEnQF_xEpumBZ5z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Osato Avan-Nomayo", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mission Accomplished: Pineapple Fund Bids Farewell After $55M in Bitcoin Donations - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "\nPineapple Fund has accomplished its mandate of donating more than 5,000 BTC to non-profit organizations around the world. 60 Charities Received Bitcoin Donations\nThe bitcoin charity made this known in a farewell Reddit post on May 10. Pine, the anonymous benefactor of the fund, thanked everyone who contributed and supported the project.\nThe Pineapple Fund donated 5,104 bitcoins to about 60 charities around the world. Due to the decline in the value of the crypto since the December 2017, the total amount donated was $55.75 million. Some of the beneficiaries include the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF) , Pencils of Promise, and the Internet Archive.\nThe OMF funds research into complex and chronic diseases. It received a total of $5 million in bitcoin donations from the fund. Pencils of Promise received $1.25 million worth of bitcoin. The organization focuses on improving the education infrastructure in countries like Laos, Ghana, and Guatemala. The Internet Archive is an online library that provides books and software free of charge. It received about $2 million in bitcoin from the fund between December 2017 and May 2018.\nOther beneficiaries include the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and GiveDirectly. MAPS focuses on PTSD therapies using psychedelics while GiveDirectly supports the transfer of money to people in need. According to Pine, the fund received tens of thousands of applications from charities around the world.\nSpeaking in the farewell message, Pine expressed gratitude to all who took part in the project, saying:\nI want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.

Posted on By Amit Teli\nWall Street is working its way into the world of bitcoin, with several notable firms announcing this month that they are getting ready to participate in the market. You might think mainstream support for the highly speculative digital asset would give bitcoin and its crypto cousins a boost, as it helps unlock demand from much bigger investors.\nHowever, the crypto market seems unimpressed. Bitcoin prices are down this month.\nThis is despite a New York Times report that Goldman Sachs will post bids and offers for bitcoin futures, and is looking into ways to trade actual crypto tokens. A few days later, the newspaper reported that Intercontinental Exchange—the owner of the New York Stock Exchange —is discussing a type of bitcoin swap for institutional investors.\nThese derivatives could help open the door for large investors to get exposure to digital tokens, as there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about how crypto will be regulated. But futures and swaps can allow traders to bet on just about any asset’s price and, importantly, they fall under existing regulations administered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nOther financial firms are also looking at ways to build scaffolding around the crypto market. Bloomberg, which runs the most popular data and messaging platform for Wall Street traders, said recently that it’s launching an index for the largest, most liquid crypto assets. It partnered with Galaxy Digital Capital Management, which was founded by former Goldman partner Mike Novogratz.\nThese aren’t the first forays by big finance into crypto. Bitcoin futures started trading at global derivatives exchanges in Chicago last year, just as digital token prices were soaring, with bitcoin peaking at nearly $20,000.\nIn a March earnings call, BNY Mellon executives said they were looking at ways to play a role in the custody of cryptocurrencies. The bank has $33 trillion (pdf) of assets under custody and administration. Custody—safeguarding a customer’s assets against theft or loss—is arguably one of the biggest challenges for crypto investors, as exchanges have often had their holdings stolen by hackers. Unlike institutional financial markets, crypto exchanges typically don’t have a specialized, separation of duties for this service.\nMaybe bitcoin prices would be even lower without the growing interest from Wall Street stalwarts. But so far, the advance of traditional financial players into the burgeoning crypto market hasn’t marked a return to the euphoria and soaring prices seen last year.\nSource: Qz ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amit teli w", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:01:18.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d8527be469b435b5280f91cec695deac7b82b1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0JZBGnqlYR2fomHvB6kxriUYPfIyHAqHxwPi.LcfXTpUrFoZAIi_J_JCloedjxSibEpwZr9MQLspok9jO.fI81LFJjM_buBZZXPV.Zc71A8WDJas0ESdFl4SJzshaXJIRLJw_YMriIQ--", "site_full": "www.okas.info", "site": "okas.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Billionaire Investor Says Investing in Bitcoin is Essential, Optimistic in Crypto 2018 – Crypto Addict", "title_full": "Billionaire Investor Says Investing in Bitcoin is Essential, Optimistic in Crypto 2018 – Crypto Addict", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d8527be469b435b5280f91cec695deac7b82b1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0JZBGnqlYR2fomHvB6kxriUYPfIyHAqHxwPi.LcfXTpUrFoZAIi_J_JCloedjxSibEpwZr9MQLspok9jO.fI81LFJjM_buBZZXPV.Zc71A8WDJas0ESdFl4SJzshaXJIRLJw_YMriIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Billionaire Investor Says Investing in Bitcoin is Essential, Optimistic in Crypto 2018 – Crypto Addict", "text": "Billionaire Investor Says Investing in Bitcoin is Essential, Optimistic in Crypto By okas Posted on May 11, 2018\nNovogratz says that it’s essential for every investor to have a minimum stake in cryptocurrency on the launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). Bitcoin Bull Calls Owning Crypto Essential\nMaggie Lake hosted Micheal Novogratz CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital Capital Management on CNN’s financial review Markets Now to talk about his partnership with Bloomberg in launching the BGCI. Novogratz was bullish throughout the interview with his advice on investing in cryptocurrencies saying;\n“ It’s almost essential for every investor to have at least 1% to 2% of their portfolio “\nNovogratz, formerly a hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner invested 10% of his wealth in digital currencies in 2017 said that it’s “almost irresponsible” not to own some Bitcoin at this point.\nThe billionaire investors insistence on putting money into Crypto is not based on the returns to be had but rather on the future potential of the blockchain technology that enables cryptocurrency to function. He told the CNN host “ these technologies in two to four years are going to give every vertical a challenge .” RELATED : Warren Buffet Says Shopping for Bitcoin is Playing, Not Investing\nThe Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index went live on Wednesday which will track the performance of ten of the largest most liquid currencies including; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Ripple, and Zcash. “The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index brings unprecedented transparency to the crypto markets. We are excited to help drive the decentralized revolution forward through the creation of BGCI ,” said a statement released to Bloomberg news. BGCI an Important Step for Bitcoin\nThe creation of the BGCI marks another step in the evolution of crypto trading as traditional and institutional investors seek guidance and security to bet on Bitcoin. Alan Campbell, Global Product Manager for Bloomberg Indices told Bloomberg news that “The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market.” RELATED : Airdropping Turns into Common Methodology for Builders to Promote Cryptocurrencies\nGoldman Sachs opened the first Wall Street-based digital assets trading desk earlier this month and Novogratz predicts the New York Stock Exchange will be involved in the space within six months.\nWarren Buffet who has been reliably bearish on Bitcoin grabbed a lot of press recently when he said that Bitcoin was like “rat poison” but Novogratz shrugged off the critical comments by the oracle of Omah saying “ In a lot of ways, this is a Millennial-led revolution … what I’ve found is guys with gray hair [are] much more skeptical .” Share this: Tweet Related posts: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "micheal novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin bull calls owning crypto essential maggie lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortress investment group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T17:39:32.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae6ea3961f4edf95cf24b9a4f034b47bc0e6b0f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7blDUBjpGJHt", "site_full": "helpscoin.cryptograbber.com", "site": "cryptograbber.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Loses $9K Support As Markets React To S.

This has cut Ethereum’s market capitalisation to US$68.5 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has crashed 15% lower over the last 24 hours to 68 U.S. cents, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$26.6 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has plunged almost 17% over the period to US$1,381.36 per token, reducing its market capitalisation to US$23.6 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price is also down almost 17% during the last 24 hours to US$15.08. EOS now has a market capitalisation of US$12.8 billion.\nOutside the top five the declines have been just as severe.\nLitecoin (LTC) is down 10%, Cardano (ADA) is off 18%, Stellar (XLM) has fallen 17%, IOTA (MIOTA) has tumbled 17.5%, and TRON (TRX) has dropped almost 17%.\nWhat happened?\nOne potential catalyst for this decline appears to be speculation that South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, UPbit, has been targeted by regulator on charges of fraud.\nAccording to Coin Patrol , prosecutors are believed to be alleging that UPbit has been transferring funds from customer accounts to a separate account belonging to an executive of the company. UPbit has not yet responded to the speculation.\nConsidering how big the South Korean market is, it comes as little surprise to see the market selloff in a panic today.

We have been repeatedly mentioning that the region around $8800 is likely to act as strong support and also the line in the sand for the bulls and the bears. If the prices break through this region, then we are likely to see the prices fall even further but as long as the prices are above this region, then we should be seeing the bulls continue to be in control of the market as such. We believe that the bulls remain in control at this point of time and that the trend is still up but all that could change in a matter of a few hours. Suggested Articles How to Short Bitcoin? Prices Below $9000 There has not been any major fundamentals that has led to the latest push lower in the BTC markets but it is generally the overall short term trend that seems to have set in over the last few days which is bringing in this weakness and eroding the general investor sentiment. The bulls need to make their stand pretty soon and show who is in control if they want to have any further chances of propping the prices up else they could easily lose control in due course of time and this would not be good in the medium term. Bitcoin 4H More The ETH prices have also taken a cue from the BTC market and have dropped lower but with the support around the $700 region still a bit far away, the bulls continue to remain in control. The prices are back below the $750 region and this should be a matter of concern for the bulls for the short and medium term. Forecast Looking ahead to the rest of the day, it is going to be a crucial day as we head towards the weekend. We will have to watch the price action closely today and over the weekend and see whether the support prices manage to hold or whether they give way.

Iran is facing renewed sanctions from the United States which could signal the start of new economic problems. There are also reports that the Iranian government is looking to create a state-owned cryptocurrency. Impending Economic Troubles\nFresh sanctions from the U.S. will adversely affect Iran’s exports especially oil which forms a considerable portion of its GDP. The country’s currency, the rial has lost a lot of ground on the U.S. dollar. This decrease in value follows several months of forex shortage and financial difficulties in the banking sector. As a result, the local economy has been declining with the situation expected to worsen with the issuing of fresh sanctions. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has tried to remedy the situation but seemingly to no avail. The apex bank unified the official and black-market forex rates, but the rial has continued to plummet. Iran Sanctions: People Are Turning To #Bitcoin To Get Money Out https://t.co/ascSmWuI17\n— Dennis Parker (@Xentagz) May 10, 2018 A State-owned Crypto Solution.\nThere have been numerous reports that the Iranian government is developing a state-owned cryptocurrency. Jayad Azari-Jahromi, the country’s ICT Minister, announced in April that an experimental model of the local crypto project was ready. This announcement followed the ban placed by the CBI on Bitcoin and other cryptos. The country’s apex bank prohibited all banks and lending institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.\nIf Iran does develop a local crypto, it will be following in the footsteps of Venezuela. The Latin-American nation launched its petro cryptocurrency earlier in the year. Many see the petro as a way of circumventing economic restrictions affecting the country. In response, the United States has banned the petro, and this will likely diminish its exchangeability. If Iran decides to follow the same route, its local cryptocurrency will likely suffer the same ban. Bitcoin to the Rescue\nDespite the Bitcoin ban, Iranians are still using bitcoin to send money out of the country. According to reports in the local media, residents of the nation have spent more than $2.5 billion in acquiring cryptos in recent months. The CBI ban, however, is expected to significantly reduce the outflow by making more significant transactions a lot more difficult.\nMohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, the Chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s Economic Commission, believes most of the crypto activities in the country are speculative investments. He also said that foreign cryptocurrencies are a threat to Iran’s banking system. As such, it is necessary for the government to develop a national virtual currency.\nCan Iran navigate the problems brought about by economic sanctions using cryptocurrency?

An Overreaction?\nThe stakes are high for Upbit, being owned by a subsidiary of Korean messenger giant Kakao.\nIn March, Bitcoinist reported the exchange launched Korea’s first cryptocurrency index, UBCI, to aid market insight for investors.\nDespite some commentators considering the user flight in light of the inspections as an “overreaction,” the episode appears to underscore the sway South Korean traders still exert over the market.\nSeoul has sought to cement the legitimacy and transparency of the cryptocurrency exchange sector this year, obliging operators to square their tax bills retrospectively for 2017 and adhere to a strict ban on anonymous trading.\nThe latter directive has proven especially troubling for smaller operators, which have complained of banking difficulties delaying their vetting of users and accidentally placing them in a legal red zone.\nAs of press time, BTC/USD was circling $8740 across major exchanges, down 6.5% from $9350 over a period of around 20 hours.\nThe move has had a knock-on effect on altcoins, with Ether (ETH) dropping 8.4% to lose $700 support while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both fell around 15%.\nWhat do you think about Upbit’s investigation?

Worried that the process is too complicated? Well, fear not — trading bitcoin couldn’t be any easier. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to make your first bitcoin trade using SimpleFX. Getting Registered\nFirst and foremost, you will need an account to start trading on SimpleFX — and creating one is a simple process.\nSimply head on over to SimpleFX.com and click the green “CREATE ACCOUNT” button on the top right-hand side of the screen.\nYou may create a SimpleFX account using your Facebook or Google accounts, or use an existing email. Afterward, you will need to check your email address to complete the steps required for verification and the transfer of funds.\nOnce you’ve completed these initial registration steps, you’ll be ready to start trading! Make Your Move\nFirst, you will need to select your desired market from the left-hand side. For this guide, let’s assume you would like to start by trading Bitcoin.\nAfter clicking BTCUSD, you will need to choose a side — buy or sell. If you’ve already deposited bitcoin or another cryptocurrency into your wallet, you will be able to open buy or sell position (hopefully for a profit).\nHowever, let’s assume this is your first ever bitcoin trade. In this case, we’re obviously looking to buy\nYou will also want to choose between a market order — an order which is filled immediately at the current market price — or a pending order. With the latter order type, you choose the price you’d like to buy-in at, and the order will fill if and when that price is met.\nFor example, if the current buy price is 9399.04 USD, and you think the price of bitcoin will drop to 9200 USD, you may place a pending order at 9200 USD — which will fill if bitcoin market price will reach that level.\nNext, you simply need to choose the size of your order. You may purchase position worth whole bitcoins or fractions of bitcoins.\nThe trade value, required margin, and point value are all displayed for your convenience below the trade side box. Simply click the plus or minus buttons to increase or decrease your desired purchase amount.\nOnce you’ve selected how big position you would like to open, you may set prices for both profit taking and loss prevention.\n“Take Profit” is the price at which you would like to sell your bitcoin for a profit. For example, if you think Bitcoin will meet strong resistance at 10,000 USD, you may set an order to take profit at that price — in the hopes of possibly buying back in when it retraces.\nStop losses, on the other hand, may be set to minimize losses if the market should suddenly take an unexpected downturn. Many traders find these crucial, as it helps prevent large-scale losses in times of volatility and uncertainty.\nFinally, all that’s left to do is click buy!\nOf course, the process works exactly the same in reverse, should you be looking to sell.\nThat’s all there is to it. Now get out there and start making some money!\nWhat do you think of SimpleFX’s easy platform for bitcoin trading ? Do you use SimpleFX?

The dreadful sentiment seems to be a reaction to reports that South Korea’s exchange Upbit is suspected of fraud. Cryptocurrency Market Plunges as South Korea’s Upbit Exchange Suspected of Fraud\nThe price of Bitcoin dropped below the $9,000 mark and Ethereum failed at the $700 handle within the period of 24 hours as South Korea’s cryptocurrency ecosystem awaits further news regarding the suspected fraud executed by one of the largest operators in the country, Upbit.\nWhat is now known is that local mainstream media outlets have reported that a joint action between the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU), the Financial Services Commission, and Seoul Police, has resulted in the raid of Upbit’s offices. The authorities suspect the management team has falsely reported its deposited funds.\nRan Neu-Ner, the host of the Crypto Trader show on CNBC Africa, has confirmed the cryptocurrency market is being drained as concerned users take their funds out of the Upbit exchange. As digital currency investors are very likely withdrawing their assets only to deposit them with another operator, the $50 billion lost in a period of a few hours might return very swiftly. Korea: This selling is coming from people taking their funds out of Upbit as they are concerned. These people are crypto investors and won’t leave crypto- they will go to other exchanges and buy there… expect a huge bounce.\n— Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) May 11, 2018\nThe cryptocurrency exchange has notified its clients on the matter and explained that its platform and services are continuing operation. Customers are still able to make transactions and withdrawals, according to the company who ensures that client assets are safe.\n“Upbit is currently under investigation by prosecutors and is cooperating.”\nThe South Korean operator dealt approximately $1.6 billion of digital currency trades in the last 24 hours, which makes it the largest cryptocurrency in the country and the fourth in the world by daily trading volumes.\nFollowing a number of regulatory discussions to curb excessive speculation and money laundering, Korean authorities have banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as foreigners and financial institutions from using local exchanges. The financial watchdog also raided a number of venues to enforce the legislation put in place, especially after the infamous Coincheck hack . Upbit, a digital currency exchange launched in September of 2017 by fintech startup Dunamu and headed by CEO Lee Sir-goo, has been active in preventing damage due to illegal fraud by offering rewards to customers who would identify multilevel scams funding through ICOs.

With just days left there are a few things BCH holders and full node operators should know before the upgrade takes place this coming Tuesday.\nAlso read: Japan’s GMO Has Mined Over 900 Bitcoins – Hashrate Doubled Last Month Just a Few Days Left Until the May 15th Bitcoin Cash Upgrade\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is about to perform the largest block size increase ever as the upgrade will expand the block size by 4X on May 15, 2018. The development team has also added ‘Satoshi OP_Codes,’ and the fork will also increase the protocol’s default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes. Unless you run a BCH full node implementation there is not much a common user needs to do. The Hard Fork Activation Will Use the Median Time Past Method\nThe BCH fork on May 15 will be similar to the fork activations that took place on August 1, and the DAA fork that took place this past November. This means the activation will take place on May 15, but there won’t be specific block height, because the upgrade will activate based on ‘Median Time Past’ (MTP). The initiation of the hard fork will begin on Tuesday, May 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade will not be implemented until the MTP timestamp and the processing of 11 blocks equal to or greater than 1,526,400,000 takes place. Following this period after the next block, the 32MB upgrade will be live on the BCH network. Full Node Clients and Miners Must Update Software\nFull node operators need to upgrade their Bitcoin Cash clients as soon as possible, before the fork begins. ABC users can download the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version here , and those operating other full nodes like Bitcoin Unlimited, or XT should upgrade to the client that supports the 32MB increase. At the moment looking at data for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a great majority of nodes have already upgraded to the latest 0.17.1 ABC version. Full node operators and miners are required to upgrade their software in order to participate during and after the network change. May 15th Fork Will Change the Protocol’s base block size to 32 MB It is best not to transact with BCH during the May 15th Bitcoin Cash upgrade.\nIt’s always a good measure to look out for any updates provided by your exchange or wallet provider to make sure the platform you use is ready to accept the network changes. If your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s probably safe to assume that the exchange or wallet provider is ready for the upgrade, but make sure to check the app provider’s blog or info pages.\nLast Fork Took Place This November\nThe May 15th Bitcoin Cash fork that will change the protocol’s base block size to 32 MB, while adding some other interesting features will be quite a milestone for the BCH community. The last fork that took place this November was successful , and the new Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has worked flawlessly ever since. The 32MB increase will be much larger than the already sizable 8MB blocks, and the upgrade will likely be a historic day for public blockchain consensus upgrades.\nWhat do you think about the fork taking place on May 15 that will increase the base block size to 32 MB?

The majority of projects which got listed on a cryptocurrency exchange traded below the ICO price.\nICOs have become an increasingly popular way of raising capital throughout the last year. A lot of people, including the CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange – Zhao Changpeng, recognized them as viable and more convenient ways of fundraising compared to existing solutions.\nYet, there’s always been a cloud of ambiguity around them, with more and more projects arising as scams. Earlier in March, it was reported that roughly around $9 million per day was burnt due to ICO and other crypto-related scams. As we are well past the end of the first quarter of 2018, it’s time to reflect on what happened in the world of ICOs. Lack of Substance\nAccording to research from ICOrating , 46.6% of the projects didn’t have any development prior to their ICO campaign. Even though this is a major red flag for any investor or contributor, the numbers are definitive. It shows that half of the people invested in an idea, rather than in something that’s backed up by a working product or even a minimum working product (MVP) of any kind.\nWhat is more, 9% of the projects didn’t have any functioning business prior to their ICO. Meanwhile, 40% of the projects examined provided absolutely no information regarding their asset management strategy or even the names of their CEOs. This is a major red flag. Half of ICOs Failed\nA total of 412 ICOs staged in the first quarter of 2018 and only 204 managed to raise more than $100,000. Out of those, 89 got listed on public crypto exchanges, which is what the wide majority of regular investors look forward to in order to ‘flip’ the coins for a profit.\nHowever, out of the coins that got listed on an exchange, 83% actually traded below the ICO price. This goes to point out an important sentiment – even if the ICO managed to raise a lot of money and hit its funding target, it doesn’t guarantee a return on your investment. What Does This Mean?\nNone of the above goes on to say that ICOs are to be considered dangerous, scamming or unreliable. As a matter of fact, the opposite is true – under proper regulations, ICOs can truly become a much easier and quick alternative to traditional funding methods, which exclude the majority of the population.\nHowever, the statistics are quite definitive in the sentiment that there’s a long road ahead.

Bitcoin Bull Calls Owning Crypto Essential\nMaggie Lake hosted Micheal Novogratz CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital Capital Management on CNN’s financial review Markets Now to talk about his partnership with Bloomberg in launching the BGCI . Novogratz was bullish throughout the interview with his advice on investing in cryptocurrencies saying;\n“ It’s almost essential for every investor to have at least 1% to 2% of their portfolio “\nNovogratz, formerly a hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner invested 10% of his wealth in digital currencies in 2017 said that it’s “almost irresponsible” not to own some Bitcoin at this point.\nThe billionaire investors insistence on putting money into Crypto is not based on the returns to be had but rather on the future potential of the blockchain technology that enables cryptocurrency to function. He told the CNN host “ these technologies in two to four years are going to give every vertical a challenge .”\nThe Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index went live on Wednesday which will track the performance of ten of the largest most liquid currencies including; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Ripple, and Zcash. “The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index brings unprecedented transparency to the crypto markets. We are excited to help drive the decentralized revolution forward through the creation of BGCI ,” said a statement released to Bloomberg news. BGCI an Important Step for Bitcoin\nThe creation of the BGCI marks another step in the evolution of crypto trading as traditional and institutional investors seek guidance and security to bet on Bitcoin. Alan Campbell, Global Product Manager for Bloomberg Indices told Bloomberg news that “The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market.”\nGoldman Sachs opened the first Wall Street-based digital assets trading desk earlier this month and Novogratz predicts the New York Stock Exchange will be involved in the space within six months.\nWarren Buffet who has been reliably bearish on Bitcoin grabbed a lot of press recently when he said that Bitcoin was like “rat poison” but Novogratz shrugged off the critical comments by the oracle of Omah saying “ In a lot of ways, this is a Millennial-led revolution … what I’ve found is guys with gray hair [are] much more skeptical .” Billionaire Investor Says Investing in Bitcoin is Essential, Optimistic in Crypto was last modified: May 11th, 2018 by John McMahon ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "micheal novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin bull calls owning crypto essential maggie lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortress investment group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T10:39:11.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87605cd55c195d80c40355373fcb1324eff9861b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6D6wXDLkQp22t4Vidc2DnvTweEc.07YRDGnEBHY2Pn.v0Ev3Jid.l0SzduiQaDvSBE5PSQYm1DUspL4su4hXDlcBSPE7eDpi1usrzY2iY1GBeHCKAHFmdqD6_HKQx7k-", "site_full": "blokt.com", "site": "blokt.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Industry Experts Predict Bullish Summer - Bitcoin & Ethereum Price Predictions | [blokt] - Blockchain, Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News", "title_full": "Industry Experts Predict Bullish Summer - Bitcoin & Ethereum Price Predictions | [blokt] - Blockchain, Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://blokt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-ether-rocket.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87605cd55c195d80c40355373fcb1324eff9861b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6D6wXDLkQp22t4Vidc2DnvTweEc.07YRDGnEBHY2Pn.v0Ev3Jid.l0SzduiQaDvSBE5PSQYm1DUspL4su4hXDlcBSPE7eDpi1usrzY2iY1GBeHCKAHFmdqD6_HKQx7k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Greg Adams", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Industry Experts Predict Bullish Summer - Bitcoin & Ethereum Price Predictions | [blokt] - Blockchain, Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News", "text": "Telegram\nThe market was shaken today by reports of a raid on the headquarters of Upbit , Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. These reports came just a day after more than 8200 BTC were moved from the Mt. Gox cold wallets . All in all, not a good week for the crypto markets so far, with Bitcoin currently trading around $8600, down $780 from around $9380 yesterday.\nHowever, with the influx of institutional business, and money, into the crypto space, many veteran crypto experts don’t appear to be shaken by this recent news. We reached out for their take on the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. We asked where they see the BTC and ETH prices at the end of July, this year. Advertisement\nEric Kovalak, Hedge Fund CEO and Managing Partner with Vellum Capital , had the following to say:\n“We follow the balance of trends between crypto speculators and a long-term buy and holders. The first three months of the year brought a lot of nervousness to new traders and the younger traders which make up a large part of the crypto market. We feel investors who are holding no matter what will likely be rewarded the longer they are in the market.”\nKovalak continued, and drew attention to the recent volatility:\n“The last quarter has made people take a pause a question if the end game for crypto has changed. We’re happy to see prices move with a lot of volatility as this represent a market building a strong base and well tested public consensus. As conservative investors, our fund continues to believe in the investment prospects of this new digital asset class.”\nKovalak’s prediction for the Bitcoin price was as follows:\n“Digital assets are a fairly young asset class and so it’s difficult to predict if there is a specific seasonality to summer markets. We do feel that recent price movement has been effective at testing lows and building a base for higher prices. A Bitcoin price above 12,500 by end of July would be completely reasonable.”\n“We feel that midsummer crypto markets will continue to capture public interest and that buyers will come to the market more quickly with each successive round of buying. Now that we’ve seen over $19,000 for Bitcoin, it would not take any new substantial developments in the market for Bitcoin to reach in the teens by Summer. We expect to see Bitcoin over $10,000 by the end of July and potentially much higher “\nCrystal Stranger, co-founder of PeaCounts , an accounting software using AI and blockchain, has high hopes for both cryptocurrencies this summer:\n“Both Bitcoin and Ethereum will be in for big gains this summer. Especially Ethereum with the ICO boom – this will only push the price up as the utility of ETH gains momentum. And the ICO and Bitcoin references on Silicon Valley this season will probably help as well.”\nMichael Dupree, founder, and CEO of EasyBit predicts a sustained bull market thanks to innovation in Asia:\n“I think we will remain in a bull market due to all the noise about EOS and huge Korean trading volumes as of late. There is a lot of cryptocurrency innovation right now in Asia – particularly Korea.”\nKevin Barnes, CEO of Blocksafe Alliance sees Bitcoin moving towards $30k this summer:\n“I think BTC is moving towards $30k as new money comes from future government and commercial issued tokens . Crypto has it up and downs, but when you compare bitcoin to a year ago, it is much higher in value now because of the growing awareness and attraction of a newfound stored value.”\nLeah Callon-Butler, Co-Founder and Chief Impact Officer of intimate.io gives a more balanced insight, but remains long-term bullish :\n“Nobody knows where crypto prices are going short term, but we are definitely bullish on their future potential . The industry is focused on developing and advancing great blockchain tech, which is ultimately the most interesting, sustainable and world-changing piece in this conversation – beyond the price hype.”\nEvery response we received was optimistic in nature, which we might have expected, considering each of the replies came from someone who works in the cryptocurrency sector. But either way, it’s a breath of fresh air after the onslaught of negativity from business moguls such as Warren Buffet and Bill Gates .\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

Wednesday’s rise had provided the Bitcoin bulls with hopes of a late in the week rally to bring $10,000 levels back into play going into the weekend, but a range bound first half of the day ultimately weighed, with Bitcoin taking a late in the day fall. Bitcoin slid from $9,361.4 in the late afternoon to an intraday low $9,003, falling through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $9,173.3 and the day’s first major support level at $9,074.93, with support at $9,000 needed to avoid a pullback to sub-$9,000 levels for a 2 nd consecutive day. In spite of the extended bullish trend that had been formed at 6 th April’s swing lo $6,500.2, moves since 5 th May’s swing hi $9,999 have been testing the bullish trend and Thursday’s slide affirmed the formation of a near-term bearish trend with Tuesday’s swing lo $8,980 replaced by this morning’s low $8,870, Bitcoin’s failure to break through to $10,000 levels at the start of the month doing the damage. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 1.32% to $8,899.2, with Thursday’s late in the day sell-off spilling into the early hours of this morning. A start of the day high $9,018.1 was all that the Bitcoin bulls had to hold on to, with the day’s first major resistance level at $9,268.8 and seller appetite at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $9,221 left untested. An early slide through to a morning low $8,870 tested the day’s first major support level at $8,877.9, the early move reaffirming the near-term bearish trend formation. For the day ahead, Bitcoin will need to break back through to $9,000 levels and make a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $9,268.8 to shift the negative sentiment that has plagued Bitcoin and the broader market through the week, though with the bears in control, selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $9,221 will need to be overcome. Bitcoin managed to avoid tumbling back to sub-$6,000 levels in the last bearish trend that supported a run through to the swing hi $9,999. This time around, support will be called upon once more and with the regulatory chatter beginning to build ahead of an expected classification of the respective cryptocurrencies and roll out of regulations, things could turn quite bearish before recovering. Failing to move through to $9,100 levels later this morning will likely place further downside pressure on Bitcoin, which will likely bring the day’s second major support level at $8,745 into play, a hold at $9,000 levels by the day’s end a must for the Bitcoin Bulls. Bitcoin last closed out the day at sub-$9,000 back on 28 th April. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash coughed up early gains to sit at sub-$1,500 levels with a 2.5% slide, while Cardano’s ADA saw the largest slide early on, down 4.94% to $0.2779 at the time of writing, the market going through yet another sell-off ahead of the weekend.

CRYPTO: Our quant/data scientist @fundstratQuant publishing #bitcoin mining white paper. Crypto mining economics lead/explain $BTC price—suggests $39,000 per bitcoin by YE19. key takeaways below… pic.twitter.com/f5ZQ4py3jS\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 10, 2018\nThe tweet comes from a research paper published by Fundstrat which discusses how:\n“The price/miners breakeven cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level; the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.”\nEssentially, Lee is saying that because the mining economy is set to grow, based upon historical averages, Bitcoin could reach $36,000.00. This is paired with an idea that electricity costs are decreasing, and that mining has become concentrated within large scale farms and bigger operations. The paper states:\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000.00 by 2019-year end, with a $20,000 – $64,000 range.”\nThis is a very bold statement, one which may offer some good news to investors who are watching the cryptocurrency markets today. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $8,711.64, down 6.95%. Does Bitcoin look likely to hit $36,000.00 today? Not very\nBy the end of 2019, of course, if Lee is right, we could see a very different situation to hand.\nWhat should we make of this?\nOverall, you have to take these sorts of predictions with a pinch of salt, although, whilst it is wrong to be ultra-optimistic right now, it’s also wrong to be too pessimistic. Consider this, in the words of Finance Magnates:\n“It’s been a rough couple of months for Bitcoin following the crypto’s December boom and subsequent bust; at several points since the beginning of the year, BTC has sunk below $8000, lows that it had not reached since 2017. However, some analysts believe that a recovery may already be underway; the coin has stabilized near $9000 over the last several weeks.”\nThe markets that we see now are as a result of a chain of different events. Events that have led the value of Bitcoin to rocket all over the place. Ultimately, Fundstrat argue that this will balance out, and, as mining becomes more lucrative, the value of Bitcoin will jump, surpassing its optimum value of $20,000.00, and reaching as high as $64,000.00, at least, that’s what Lees tweet suggests.\nI will reiterate here that this is as a result of research carried out by Fundstrat and we aren’t saying that mining will cause Bitcoin to hit $36,000.00, it is however interesting that a firm as large as Fundstrat are publishing documents like this, considering it is such a bold statement, you must assume that what they are saying does come with good authority.\nHow Bitcoin performs over the rest of 2018, should allow us to develop a better understanding of what to expect from the currency, going into 2019 and beyond. For now, let’s track back and focus on our $20,000.00 target, after that, $36,000.00 could very well be in sight.\nSee the full report by Finance Magnates for yourself, here- https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-miners-will-drive-btc-36000-end-2019-fundstrat-predicts/ Share This Post Thomas has led a number of teams, giving training and guidance in marketing and PR.

Below is my uncut email interview, which goes much more in depth.\nCheck out “They mock vegans and eat 4lbs of steak a day: meet ‘carnivore dieters’” ( archive link ) by Olivia Solon .\nWhy do you think there is a cluster of people in Bitcoin who advocate eating all meat?\nAs I’ve said elsewhere: Bitcoin is a revolt against fiat money, and an all-meat diet is a revolt against fiat food. Once someone has grown capable of seeing beyond the lies and myths that experts peddle in one domain, it becomes easier to see beyond them in other domains as well.\nWhy do you endorse a carnivore diet rather than something like keto/atkins? (or maybe you endorse both?)\nWe were born to eat meat, not to track calories or ketones or feeding windows. Keto, Atkins, and mainstream paleo can help many people, but involve too many plants, which have anti-nutrients that can cause problems like autoimmune disorders or poor nutrient absorption. Carnivory is nutritionally complete and rich in nutrients missing from plants like B12, DHA, heme iron, and taurine.\nWhat are the health benefits you experience from eating like this?\nI personally have much clearer skin, sharper focus, improved dental health, increased lean mass, and more energy. Others have experienced relief from lifelong digestive problems, autoimmune issues (including rheumatoid arthritis), severe mental illness such as suicidal depression and bipolar, and more. Meatheals.com has many examples of people attaining better health or weight loss, and Paleomedicina is a clinic in Hungary that treats a variety of conditions with carnivorous diets, such as Crohn’s disease and brain cancer .\nWhat about in terms of productivity/work?\nGrocery shopping takes all of 10 minutes, most of which is standing in the checkout line. I spend little time in the kitchen. I spend little time thinking about food. I only need to eat once or twice a day (no snacking or cravings). Basically, it’s the greatest productivity hack, and Silicon Valley should have listened to me about it while I was there.\nWhy did you set up justmeat.co?\nWhen people hear about carnivory, they often think it’s just the dietary fantasies of one guy, me, when really, there is a lot of information out there from many lines of evidence and experience. Justmeat.co is my ongoing attempt to make an introductory portal to these ideas by sharing quality links and documents to help people learn more. I include online groups such as Zeroing In On Health , where thousands of people have shared their experiences for almost a decade, blogs by researchers such as Amber O’Hearn , old books such as those by Weston Price and Vilhjalmur Stefansson , clinical case studies by Paleomedicina , and much more.\nIt seems as though there’s a joke/trollish element to the whole Bitcoin carnivore “movement” (for lack of a better word). Do you agree? If so, how would you characterise this aspect?\nI think of it as a healthy irreverence for the “experts” who have told us that inflation is good, that Bitcoin is going to die, and that low-fat diets are healthy and saturated fat will give us heart disease. Such stupid and thoroughly dismantled myths (bullshit, if you will) has a hard time earning respect in an environment where people have more access to information.\nHave you recruited many people to eat like you do?\nHundreds of people have started eating like I do, and I receive messages all the time thanking me for encouraging them to eat more meat and learn about Bitcoin. It humbles me, and I am so glad I could help people examine the world from a fresh perspective.\nWhat do you eat in a typical day?\nI eat about 2 - 2.5 pounds of ribeye every day. Ribeye is very popular, but we see carnivores enjoying a variety of meats, including ground beef, lamb, fish, and organ meats like liver, as well as eggs.\nDo you take any supplements?\nYes, it’s called steak.\nDo you ever have days when you eat pizza/chocolate/ice cream?\nNo, never. I don’t have cravings for them either. They don’t even register in my brain as food.\nDo you ever eat any greens/vegetables?\nSame as above.\nHow much do you spend on meat in a typical week/month?\nI spend about $400/mo, but I also treat myself to premium cuts. I could live very cheaply off ground beef if I needed to.\nWhere do you source your meat from?\nCostco and HEB\nWhat’s the most challenging aspect of carnivory?\nCarnivory can be a challenge socially, because people like to “reward” themselves with sugar at every chance they can get. I just politely decline. As a lifelong contrarian, I’m used to doing things a bit differently.\nDo you ever eat out? If so how do you navigate that?\nNot much, but I eat out with friends. I order a steak or a burger. Fast food burger patties are a great choice on the go. Unfortunately, most restaurants use industrial seed oils because they are cheap. I wish restaurants would use lard and tallow instead. They also tend to give very small, overpriced meat portions.\nWhat about booze. Do you ever have a glass of wine with your steak?\nI don’t drink.\nThe 2.5lbs of meat you eat per day - how do you prepare that?\nThe reverse sear is currently my favorite way of making a steak. I like my steaks very rare.\nAnd why don’t you eat other meats or fish?\nCarnivores gravitate towards fatty beef or other ruminants because they are the most satiating. Some really like pork. Other meats, including chicken and fish, are perfectly fine if you like them, but they are often lean and not as satiating.

Given the possible emergence of issues concerning money laundering and other illegal businesses, the bank has a legitimate right to close the account of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitmynt AS. “The court finds it clear that this risk constitutes an objective reason for the bank to deny customer relationships under the Financial Contracts Act §21,” the Norwegian court stated.\nNordea is a financial group offering its services in Northern Europe, with a total operating income of EUR 9.5 billion (~US$11.33 billion) and total assets of EUR 581.6 billion (~$693.53 billion) in 2017. The company has more than 1,400 branches in 19 countries of the world. Bitmynt’s Reaction\nCreator of fintech company Bitmynt Sturle Sunde responded to the decision of the court, claiming that his digital currency exchange had lost the case, however, it had been following the Money Laundering Act and had not been suspected of criminal activity. He also was disappointed because of the court’s decision, as he claimed the sentence went a long way in limiting more than just his own business. “It’s very frustrating to get this judgment. The court has in practice put a ban on bitcoin trading,” Sunde noted. The Origin of the Argue\nThis case is not the first for Nordea and Bitmynt, as the bank closed the exchange’s account last autumn. The financial institution explained its move as prevention measure of further incidents of money laundering and terrorist financing. “According to Nordea, there were up to 1,400 transactions a month through his account, all of which concern the purchases and sales of bitcoin,” Norwegian news outlet Dn wrote. “Oslo District Court believes Nordea was in full right to deny Sunde and his company customer relations with the bank. The court rules that the bank is obliged to discontinue customer relationships if it involves the risks of transactions related to criminal offenses,” the publication went on.

Bitcoin Price at $8,500\nOver the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has dropped by more than 8 percent mainly due to two major factors: police raid into the headquarters of major South Korean exchange UPbit and the selloff of 8,000 bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee.\nAs CCN reported, the Seoul police along with the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU) and Financial Services Commission (FSC) have initiated an investigation into South Korea’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange UPbit with allegations of fraud and illicit movement of client funds to the accounts of the exchange’s executives.\nThe local police has yet to release its final report on the case and is expected to confirm its findings on Monday next week.\n“We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation. Analysis is expected to take days,” the authorities said, adding that the final report on the UPbit case will be released next week,” said local financial authorities.\nThe sell off of cryptocurrencies by South Korean traders on UPbit along with the possible sale of 8,000 bitcoins by the Mt. Gox trustee led bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market to fall.\nThe Mt. Gox trustee previously stated that it is not in its plans to sell off parts of its 200,000 bitcoin holdings until late September. But, it moved more than 8,000 bitcoins to external wallets, triggering a domino effect across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Market Turns Red\nThe entire market has fallen on May 11, without any exception. Even tokens such as ICON (ICX), Ontology (ONT), EOS, OmiseGo (OMG), and Ziliqa (ZIL), which have recorded massive gains against both bitcoin and the US dollar over the past two weeks, have recorded large losses in the range of 5 percent to 20 percent.\nGifto (GTO), STORM, Dent, Status (SNT), and other tokens which recorded 30 to 50 percent gains over the past month fell by more than 20 percent.\nAs shown in the graphic provided by Coin360, the entire market has demonstrated significant losses over the past 24 hours.\nRan Neuner, the producer of CNBC’s CryptoTrader, who has offered extensive coverage of the South Korean cryptocurrency market this week, stated that local investors believe traders on UPbit sold their cryptocurrencies on the platform with the intention of moving them to other platforms or cryptocurrency exchange. As such, investors expect the market to rebound soon.\n“Korea: This selling is coming from people taking their funds out of Upbit as they are concerned. These people are crypto investors and won’t leave crypto — they will go to other exchanges and buy there. expect a huge bounce,” said Ran.\nAs the market did in previous Mt. Gox sell offs, the cryptocurrency market is expected to rebound swiftly especially if police reports that are expected to be released next week show that UPbit did not engage in any suspicious or criminal activity.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "korean financial intelligence unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T16:16:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b5d0e4eeccbf2c0ad04e9a58ac33b73ed8d14ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1JSdaT9QtcCXEyuyPfViYVvdqDlyv_1.Es8lh_0bpx7lz5iX7nhSf2DKi4AxA71yoCRZhnUpb9HfLmrJX23en8dn7PZI.0GH0_DA2o.Lnl096P2DkMK0wRAtDfyqBe9vt", "site_full": "cointelegraph.com", "site": "cointelegraph.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones | CryptospaceTips.com", "title_full": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones | CryptospaceTips.com", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cryptospacetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy84ZDA1MWQwYzYyNzI5N2RhZGVkOTgyZTNmZDA3NjMxNS5qcGc=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b5d0e4eeccbf2c0ad04e9a58ac33b73ed8d14ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1JSdaT9QtcCXEyuyPfViYVvdqDlyv_1.Es8lh_0bpx7lz5iX7nhSf2DKi4AxA71yoCRZhnUpb9HfLmrJX23en8dn7PZI.0GH0_DA2o.Lnl096P2DkMK0wRAtDfyqBe9vt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones | CryptospaceTips.com", "text": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In App Store, Pre-Installed On All New Smartphones May 11, 2018 7 Views Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese multinational communications technology company, has announced that mobile phone users will be able to download Bitcoin (BTC) wallets on new Huawei devices starting Friday, Bloomberg reported May 10. Huawei is releasing BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet in its AppGallery app store, which will be pre-installed on all new Huawei smartphones, according to Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com. It will reportedly be the first digital currency app offered on Huawei devices. Access to apps like BTC.com’s is limited in China as the government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some parts of Apple’s App Store. While Chinese authorities shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned initial coin offerings, people can still own cryptocurrencies. De la Torre told Bloomberg: “It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.” In March, it was reported that Huawei is planning to develop a smartphone that will support decentralized applications (DApp) running on blockchain technology. Last year, Huawei shipped 90.9 mln units in the Chinese market, where it enjoys a dominant market share of 20.4 percent. Huawei’s global market share was 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement: “From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.” Last month, Huawei announced the launch of a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform focused on smart contract development, “a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security blockchain technology platform service for enterprises and developers.”\nMeanwhile, China is planning to release nationwide blockchain standards by the end of 2019.

The hard fork, scheduled on May 15 , is packed with some promising updates: a block increase to 32Mb, an increase to the OP_Return data carrier limit to 223 bytes, and the restoration of certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality. The last one is particularly intriguing, as it would unleash the smart contract and tokenization capability—on the security backbone that is Bitcoin.\nThe capability to run smart contracts is a feature more commonly associated with and popularized by Ethereum. Ethereum gave rise to thousands of blockchain projects, and thousands too many cryptocurrencies and ICO’s—most of which are only out to make a quick buck off the hype.\nThis attracted a huge stampede of wannabe developers, and as a consequence gave rise to thousands of less-than-solidly-built code. Project founders were very eager to get to the ICO stage, so much so that they launch their projects prematurely and jump into the ICO frenzy. In fact, a study dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities on the Ethereum network found an additional 34,200 risky smart contracts on the network, with almost $13.8 million at risk.\nUnsurprisingly, the past years have been quite rocky for the network, as several incidents cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars. Not all of these were lost to theft, however—some of these were merely casualties of slip-ups, bugs in the code that left investor funds susceptible to loss through seemingly innocuous commands. This has caused some to rethink building their projects on the Ethereum blockchain, and pushed some to urge the community to start holding developers accountable for their negligence.\nTokenisation and smart contracts will bring Bitcoin Cash directly head-to-head against Ethereum. With Bitcoin Cash stepping in the game—resurrecting previously deactivated OP_Codes that would unleash its smart contracts functionalities, it can effectively give Ethereum a run for its money. nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen says the resurrection of these functionalities will propel the network to the forefront of the industry.\n“The second key upgrade is restoring certain OP_codes that had been deactivated in the Bitcoin script language. These OP_codes are being brought back to Bitcoin Cash to enable the ability for tokenisation and smart contract execution on the BCH network. This will be a game-changer in the cryptocurrency space because it makes Bitcoin Cash the clear leader, with the ability to do all in one coin-efficient payments and advanced technical functions such as tokenisation and smart contracts – what many other coins and blockchains separately claim to do. We at nChain and other groups have already been working on new tokenisation solutions to implement on Bitcoin Cash.”\nIn a press release, nChain expounded on what this would enable on Bitcoin Cash:\n“The restoring of certain OP_Codes in the Bitcoin scripting language will bring advanced technical functionality to the Bitcoin Cash network. In computing, operating codes are the section of automated language which dictates what operation must be performed. The restored OP_Codes will enable tokenisation and smart contracts to be executed on the BCH blockchain. More advanced functions will be possible with future upgrades to the Bitcoin Cash network.\nTokenisation – of financial instruments, assets, rewards, or for Initial Coin Offering (ICO) purposes – and the ability to make use of smart contracts, means that Bitcoin Cash can be used to do anything that other blockchains such as Ethereum, can do. Bitcoin Cash is already a superior payment system, because it is fast, low-fee and allows borderless transactions to anywhere in the world. With these additional technical capabilities, Bitcoin Cash can be the all-in-one coin,” they wrote.\nSpeaking at the University of Exeter last week, Nguyen further reiterated how these developments will drive Bitcoin Cash forward in the competition, and how it may drive some into obsolescence.\n“At the end of the day, as I explained, if all those things are possible on one coin, why do you need the others?,” Nguyen asked. “There were some that birthed, like Ethereum, because they wanted to do smart contract capability which people did not think was possible on Bitcoin—because some people turned off some of the OP_Codes. Now that they’re restored, you have to ask yourself how much do you need Ethereum anymore?” Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins.

The BTC.com wallet will be the first cryptocurrency app offered by Shenzhen-based Huawei. The AppGallery will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones and will be rolled out to older devices in the coming months, he said.\nThe move will likely have the most impact in the Chinese market, where Huawei is the biggest mobile phone seller. The nation has been a hotbed for cryptocurrencies. The Chinese government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some sections of Apple’s iTunes, limiting access to apps like BTC.com’s. While China has shut down cryptocurrency trading platforms and initial coin offerings, people can still own virtual currencies.\n“It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market,” de la Torre said in a telephone interview. “The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.”\nBTC.com, which also controls the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies. Huawei is considering developing a mobile phone targeting blockchain-based applications, Bloomberg News reported in March.\n“From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future,” Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement.\nNow read: New Huawei Y Series smartphones launched in South Africa App Gallery Bitcoin wallet China Huawei", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "torre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "huawei technologies co.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T08:38:49.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "338beed8fcdc048de3f23da1f480414f33c70af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3.PuMv9FAiaGUNvhrOAqYugEYHu117l7gJAhQrM78gBojNVfLNO4CKOob7onXL.PVA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Discussion 5/11/18 : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin Daily Discussion 5/11/18 : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "338beed8fcdc048de3f23da1f480414f33c70af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3.PuMv9FAiaGUNvhrOAqYugEYHu117l7gJAhQrM78gBojNVfLNO4CKOob7onXL.PVA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Discussion 5/11/18 : Bitcoin", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

You might think mainstream support for the highly speculative digital asset would give bitcoin and its crypto cousins a boost, as it helps unlock demand from much bigger investors.\nHowever, the crypto market seems unimpressed. Bitcoin prices are down this month.\nThis is despite a New York Times report that Goldman Sachs will post bids and offers for bitcoin futures, and is looking into ways to trade actual crypto tokens. A few days later, the newspaper reported that Intercontinental Exchange—the owner of the New York Stock Exchange —is discussing a type of bitcoin swap for institutional investors.\nThese derivatives could help open the door for large investors to get exposure to digital tokens, as there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about how crypto will be regulated. But futures and swaps can allow traders to bet on just about any asset’s price and, importantly, they fall under existing regulations administered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nOther financial firms are also looking at ways to build scaffolding around the crypto market. Bloomberg, which runs the most popular data and messaging platform for Wall Street traders, said recently that it’s launching an index for the largest, most liquid crypto assets. It partnered with Galaxy Digital Capital Management, which was founded by former Goldman partner Mike Novogratz.\nThese aren’t the first forays by big finance into crypto. Bitcoin futures started trading at global derivatives exchanges in Chicago last year, just as digital token prices were soaring, with bitcoin peaking at nearly $20,000.\nIn a March earnings call, BNY Mellon executives said they were looking at ways to play a role in the custody of cryptocurrencies. The bank has $33 trillion (pdf) of assets under custody and administration. Custody—safeguarding a customer’s assets against theft or loss—is arguably one of the biggest challenges for crypto investors, as exchanges have often had their holdings stolen by hackers. Unlike institutional financial markets, crypto exchanges typically don’t have a specialized, separation of duties for this service.\nMaybe bitcoin prices would be even lower without the growing interest from Wall Street stalwarts. But so far, the advance of traditional financial players into the burgeoning crypto market hasn’t marked a return to the euphoria and soaring prices seen last year.

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night’s move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading RangeUntil last night’s drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.Sometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume ViewAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn’t rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.A somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn’t just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro ViewSummary:A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours.This move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrendThe sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Assets like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash are all seriously in the red, having dropped anywhere from a few hundred dollars to over $1,000 since experiencing monthly highs last week. Bitcoin (BTC)\nThe price of Bitcoin has fallen dramatically over the last 24 hours. At press time, the currency is wallowing at $8,477 – roughly $600 less than where it stood yesterday afternoon. Prior to that, the currency had experienced a weekend high of $9,800 but subsequently dropped to $9,500 and $9,300 respectively within a 48-hour period. This ultimately marks a $1,200 drop in only five days. Bitcoin is down 5.67% over the past 24 hours.\nThere are several alleged reasons for the price drop. One comes by way of South Korea, a growing blockchain and cryptocurrency hub that currently accounts for roughly one-quarter of the world’s digital asset trades. Related Story: Top South Korean Crypto Exchange Raided by Local Police\nOne of the country’s largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit, has been raided by government authorities, thus renewing the notion that South Korea is heightening regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. Upbit is suspected of illicitly moving customer funds to the accounts of its executives.\nIn addition, a Mt. Gox trustee is suspected of having moved several Bitcoin funds into four separate wallets, which may have triggered a subsequent sell-off and contributed to the price fall. Several trustees of the now infamous Japanese exchange have continued to move large sums of Bitcoin despite acknowledgments that such actions may contribute to wide price swings in what is already a widely unstable market.\nStill, many analysts – including financial strategist Robert Sluymer – feel that Bitcoin will undoubtedly go higher from here. Sluymer blames the current price drop on newfound regulatory attempts but feels that these will soon thin out, allowing bitcoin to recover by summer. Ethereum (ETH)\nEthereum has dropped nearly $100 from its previous mark of $752 mentioned during our last price piece . ETH is now trading for about $680. Ethereum is down 5.82% over the past 24 hours.

Ripple (XRP)\nRipple has fallen big time from its previous $0.80 position to $0.69 at press time. Analyst Tomas Salles of FX Street suggests that the coin’s support level could drop as low as $0.55 as XRP incurs its latest sell-off. Ripple is down 7.66% over the past 24 hours.\nDespite this, Ripple’s partnerships continue to grow. Related Story: Ripple Announces Successful xRapid Transfer from US to Mexico\nRecently, the completed a successful pilot of its xRapid platform and performed interbank transfers between the United States and Mexico.\nThe results suggest that XRP lowers transaction fees by as much as 40 to 70 percent, and that said transactions typically only require between three and five seconds. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nBitcoin Cash has fallen hard from its previous position beyond $1,600. At the time of writing, BCH stands just beyond $1,400, marking a $200+ fall in just a few days. Bitcoin Cash is down 7.68% over the past 24 hours.\nThe price drops incurred by both BCH and Ethereum in recent days has lit a fire in the ongoing “war” between traders. Many ETH enthusiasts say that Ether is a pure form of cryptocurrency technology, and free from interference and tampered preserves, while Bitcoin Cash supporters believe BCH is more reliable, boasts faster forks, and is a stronger representation of what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind for the cryptocurrency. Litecoin (LTC)\nLitecoin has crashed to about $140. This marks a massive fall from $157 since our previous price discussion and a 10.5 percent drop over the last 24 hours. Litecoin is down 6.75% over the past 24 hours.\nAnalyst Manoj B. Rawal of FX Street suggests that immediate bear patterns in Litecoin’s behavior will build massive resistance at both $149 and $155. Market Summary\nThe prices of major cryptocurrencies continue to fall, and the global market cap has lost $50 billion over the last day, currently sitting at $388 billion.

Segwit or Segregated Witness is the name that was given to the implementation of a soft fork change in the transaction format of Bitcoin. This was considered a memorable moment for the LTC as well the BTC community. They have now completed one year since its first initiation.\nCharlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin recently tweeted:\n“ SegWit activated on Litecoin a year ago today!”\nThe previous year began with three concerning issues for the Bitcoin community. There was an insurgency to increase the blocksize to process more transactions.\nThe second issue was that about increasing numbers of covert ASIC Boost mining on the Bitcoin network. ASIC is specialized to carry out specific functions such as mining.\nFinally the issue of transaction malleability which was one of the most flawed loopholes of the transaction ID verification. The malleability of the transaction means that there are possible ways for a user to potentially alter the transaction ID. This was a major issue as it was reported that if users manipulate the data at a favorable time, extra Bitcoin was sent.\nThe idea of Segwit was to solve the above mentioned hard-core problems. Instead of a complete Segwit hardfork as suggested by Peter Wiulle, a Bitcoin developer in 2015, it was proposed that a soft fork is carried out.\nEven after the benefits offered by segwit such as lightning speed transactions, double the blockchain size, etc. people were skeptical about it.\nThe announcement of a soft fork update created FUD in the community; hence the miners did not agree to implement segwit. Back then Charlie Lee along with the Litecoin [LTC] team made an attempt and promoted segwit and implemented it onto Litecoin. After the execution of Segwit into Litecoin, the percentage of mined Litecoin hiked as depicted below. Litecoin mining chart\n“Litecoin just wants to boast and trying to make a name.”\nA Redditor says:\n“Thank you, Lee, for helping the mass understand to believe in the soft-fork, could not forget the time the blocksize increased and I was like this is the future baby.”\nA Twitterati says:\n“Segwit update was a much required fork this was a joint effort from Bitcoin and litecoin but it did not solve all the issues regarding the hacks. Nothing new with it as it keeps happening a new update will be required again.”\nJoel Mathew is a full-time creative content writer for AMB Crypto.

Required fields are marked * Comment A look back into Tron [TRX]’s journey this week\nPublished Sthuthie Murthy Source: Flickr\nAs the Monday market looked slightly positive, the momentum has begun to raise with the majority of the coins seeing gains with a considerable amount. Tron [TRX] is on the edge with a neutral figure, still going strong on its recent acquisition of the 10th position.\nThe current trade value for TRX is $0.072 with no significant increase since yesterday while the market cap also hovers around $4.7 billion. The prices might not favor them considering the volatility of market but they are definitely thriving to march ahead in every other possible way, as their weekly report reflects it.\nModule: Log information improvement, exception handling of network modules and stability of network modules facilitated. Incrementing transaction processing speed, pressure tests are in progress while some bugs are being fixed too.\nConsensus: Improvement in mechanism documentation, funds-related code tested and reviewed. Restriction on the number of account creations will be increased as they work on optimizing locking interfaces.\nWallet: API logic combined, users are prohibited to transfer tokens to any non-existent accounts, and account setup time duration has been increased. Implement expired transactions and the test is also looked into.\nCommunity Accomplishments: A lot of new candidates for the Super Representative Elections, with the voting lines scheduled to be open on the 26 th of June. Statement from Tron on the successful conclusion of the 30 million airdrop for Ethereum Community on May 7 th after initiating it on April 27th. 30 million TRX tokens worth about $1.7 million USD were sent to a total of 602,881 addresses into active Ethereum accounts since January 1 st this year. Following this, next day the public blockchain Odyssey-v1.0.6 was updated to the latest version and announcement of the virtual machine release on the 25 th of this month. An issue of the first $100,000 loan to support the developer’s community further in their R&D, expand Tron’s ecosystem, and eliminate capital shortage for outstanding projects. Released rewards list on Github along with SR ranking criteria for the election. The total number of candidates currently applied for the SR election goes up to 50.\nTron mentioned in the report:\n“In order to meet the needs of the global community and the holders of different countries, the official team of Tron Foundation will continue to update digital asset trading platforms that supported the Tron migration.”\nBitoshi_sakamoto, a Twitterati says:\n“The first step of innovation lies in believing #trx #tron community has taken the first step already now the next phase begins reshaping the internet as we know it finally four words great work team.”\nMarcus Charles, a Tron enthusiast says:\n“Great news. Thank you everyone for such effort. Very excited for what is to come in the future.”\nMrCrypto, a Justin Sun follower tweeted addressing the founder:\n“Thank you for the ongoing communication about the progress of the Tron brand. We are with and support your goals.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:29:55.024+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 1410, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=30800", "requestsLeft": 354}
