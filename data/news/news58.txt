There was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $980 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now above the $1,040 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Bitcoin cash price is gaining bullish momentum above $1,000 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move above $1,100 to accelerate gains in the near term.\nBitcoin Cash Price Trend This past week, there were mostly range moves below $1,040 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price was struggling to gain pace above the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels. Finally, there was an upside break and the price settled above the $1,040 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). During the upside move, the price broke many hurdles, including the $1,000 barrier.\nMoreover, there was a break above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,323 swing high to $871 low. More importantly, there was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $980 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely in a positive zone above $1,040. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,323 swing high to $871 low at $1,096 is acting as a resistance . A break and close above $1,100 is needed for more gains towards $1,200.\nLooking at the chart , the price action is positive above $1,000. On the downside, the broken resistances at $1,040 and $1,000 are likely to act as supports if the price moves down.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now well above the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,100\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Gaining Upside Momentum appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T09:10:44.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "719fb4cf6bee9864d59d2e90875a26b7a5f0911d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRjTwiP74zyZ4jpkYLPFqa44q_EK4mCOd2CxQjYAmTI8.25rshMVtd_ANA9vS.j3dU08SGLqhtDu3iFwb_QmhrnYtk_x3qjnAM-", "site_full": "www.fin24.com", "site": "fin24.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.24.com/articles/Fin24/Money/Investments/rss", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Fin24 Investments", "title": "Fin24.com | Bitcoin Ponzis on the rise", "title_full": "Fin24.com | Bitcoin Ponzis on the rise", "published": "2018-06-03T08:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7121/78a0031699474451a2e43328fdc144e2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "719fb4cf6bee9864d59d2e90875a26b7a5f0911d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRjTwiP74zyZ4jpkYLPFqa44q_EK4mCOd2CxQjYAmTI8.25rshMVtd_ANA9vS.j3dU08SGLqhtDu3iFwb_QmhrnYtk_x3qjnAM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T08:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fin24.com | Bitcoin Ponzis on the rise", "text": " Bitcoin Ponzis on the rise Jun 03 2018 06:07 Hawks investigating massive R1bn investment scam\nThe number of suspicious cryptocurrency investment schemes being reported to local law enforcement and other regulatory authorities is on the rise.\nThis has emerged in the wake of the Hawks’ investigation into an alleged R1 billion cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme run by BTC Global.\n“There are others,” said Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi. He said they were “under inquiry” and could not be named at this stage.\nOver 1 000 people who had lost money in the alleged BTC Global scam had come forward with affidavits.\n“People are coming in every day.”\nCryptocurrency investment schemes BitClub Network and Four Corners Alliance Group allegedly show the hallmarks of either a Ponzi scheme or a hybrid Ponzi and pyramid scheme.\nThere are no telephonic contact details on either of the BitClub Network and Four Corners Alliance Group websites.\nCity Press e-mailed questions to Four Corners Alliance Group, which has a business address in Las Vegas, the US, and in Montana Park, Pretoria. Questions were sent to BitClub Network via a website contact form. Neither site had responded by late Friday.\nAmong the red flags is the offer of financial reward for recruiting new members, or larger payouts for larger numbers of investors in the pool.\nMulaudzi said the BTC Global scheme had affected about 28 000 South Africans from all walks of life.\nHe said many had lost over R100 000 when the scheme crashed in early February, although “some got lucky” and pulled their money out in time.\nSanet Schoeman, of Kempton Park, said she lost R44 000 of her initial R62 000 investment with BTC, which promised to invest in Bitcoin and pay returns of 2% per day, or 14% per week.\nSchoeman said when she started a new job last year she wanted to invest her pension payout from her previous job. A colleague suggested BTC Global. She said that at the end of October last year she invested R30 000 for herself and, in November, R17 000 for her husband. In January this year, she put R15 000 into a BTC Global electronic wallet for her son.\nShe said the promised returns initially showed in the wallet. Each week, an investor could choose to move their Bitcoin earnings from BTC to an electronic wallet held with legitimate London-based digital currency company Luno.\nFrom there it could be paid into a bank account.\nSchoeman said she withdrew some money before the scheme crashed in early February, but had reinvested it and thus did not recover her entire capital before the scheme collapsed.\nAt that point, the three accounts reflected a total of R92 000 in earnings.\nA number of BTC investors City Press spoke to said a Steven Twain was the mythical BTC Global investor. However, no one had ever met or spoken to him directly.\nCommunication was through a group of administrators, who appeared to be genuine. At least one of them warned the investment group that Twain was running a scam. This was before the accounts were frozen. READ: SA cryptocurrency platform claims 'super shy' founder has stolen all its money\nBTC chat groups had been set up on the Telegram instant messenger service. Schoeman said there were people on the group who had lost over R1 million.\nShe said she referred her sister-in-law and a friend to BTC Global and that the crash had put a bit of a strain on their relationship.\nShe hoped they would get something back once the Hawks had completed their investigation.\nAnother victim of the alleged scam, Linda Horsfield of Gauteng, had submitted an affidavit to the Hawks. She did not expect to recoup the $5 000 (R63 000) she put into the scheme.\n“The guys know the game is up and will just squirrel it away,” she said. She believed if any money was recovered, it would go to the Asset Forfeiture Unit.\nIn her affidavit, she stated she first heard of Twain from a friend’s mother who had been receiving the “guaranteed” return of 2% per day.\n“Shortly thereafter I overheard a lady at the annual general meeting of Wealth Migrate, a company I am a shareholder in, talking about earning 2% per day from an investment made with Twain.”\nThis woman introduced Horsfield to a man who had apparently been invested in BTC for a long time and had been paid 14% interest every Monday.\nShe met him in November last year to find out more. He told her that a woman who knew Twain personally introduced him to the scheme.\nHorsfield said she bought into the scheme with cryptocurrency she already owned. She said she knew of people who bonded their houses to buy into BTC Global.\n“People have lost their houses, their cars, convinced their in-laws to invest their retirement money.”\nShe said she had advised everyone she had referred to BTC to withdraw their interest every week, although she did not heed her own advice. READ: Hawks investigating massive R1bn investment scam\nShe said people on the BTC Telegram group said they could get access to their Bitcoin earnings if they paid a $1 000 (R12 400) access fee.\nShe said there was no way she was paying more money, but was worried that if she said anything negative on the group about this, she’d be kicked out.\nRumours and theories ran wild on the groups, she said. These ranged from Twain’s having been robbed and his computer equipment stolen, to his having to sort out tax issues.\nA couple who live on the Garden Route, who did not want to be named, said they had taken money out of the bond on their house to invest R250 000. They first put their money in the scheme in December. They lost all of it.\nA woman in Gauteng, who had referred Horsfield to BTC, said she invested about R12 500 on September 1. Because she withdrew her weekly dividend, she made her money back and “a little bit” extra.\nShe believed the money was genuinely invested in Bitcoin, as electronic wallets were created, but that after making large gains late last year, the Bitcoin price dropped in January and Twain may have been overextended.\nLuke Buckland, founder of a private cryptocurrency investment partnership called Cryptocats, said Bitcoin was great for running a Ponzi scheme. This was because it had global reach, coupled with the promise of riches through technology and was advertised via social media.\n“It’s a perfect storm,” said Buckland.\nQuestions sent to the SA Reserve Bank and Treasury were not answered before deadline on Friday.\n* SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE : Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.

Hangwani Mulaudzi on the matter.\nThe number of “suspicious cryptocurrency investment schemes” reported to police is increasing, and over 1,000 people who lost money in the BTC Global scam have submitted affidavits on the matter.\nBTC Global, which promised extremely large returns over short periods of time if you sent them your Bitcoin, caught out over 27,000 people – including South Africans and Australians.\nAccording to the Hawks, over $50 million was lost in the BTC Global scam – with South Africans investing between R16,000 and R1.4 million each.\nA tree feller from Pretoria East said he put R100,000 into the scheme, when the “guaranteed 14% weekly returns” stopped coming in.\nThe City Press reported that another victim, a woman from Kempton Park, wanted to invest her pension payout in a high-return scheme, and a colleague suggested BTC Global.\nShe invested R62,000 in total – R30,000 for herself, R17,000 for her husband, and R15,000 for her son.\nOf that, she lost R44,000 when BTC Global collapsed. More cases\nThe City Press has now reported that more people “are coming in every day” with reports of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment schemes and how they lost money.\nThe warning signs of the latest Bitcoin schemes include financial rewards for recruiting new members, and larger payouts for larger numbers of investors in the pool.\nTo avoid becoming a victim to a Bitcoin scheme , thoroughly research before investing your money.\nIn the case of BTC Global, it was run by “master trader” Steven Twain. A search for Twain showed he did not exist, however.\nThe Consumer Protection Act also describes any scheme that offers returns of 20% above the repo rate as a “multiplication scheme” – otherwise known as a Ponzi scheme.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/234618-beware-of-these-common-cryptocurrency-scams.html", "https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cryptocurrency/250901-you-should-have-seen-that-btc-global-was-a-scam-from-a-mile-away.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hangwani mulaudzi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "city press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kempton park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pretoria east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T09:20:12.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d4d8989214aab0545c924ab3a8ad28e5f60d670", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuTR4IRGoRIN4LelHIOMkOPB1JtkkDBHkaU1etBV0UY647x8dj.xiZ2c9BvQfbAiCk-", "site_full": "voxbox.rocks", "site": "voxbox.rocks", "site_section": "http://voxbox.rocks/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "VoxBox", "title": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018", "title_full": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018", "published": "2018-06-03T08:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d4d8989214aab0545c924ab3a8ad28e5f60d670", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuTR4IRGoRIN4LelHIOMkOPB1JtkkDBHkaU1etBV0UY647x8dj.xiZ2c9BvQfbAiCk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vox Box", "published": "2018-06-03T08:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018", "text": "\nWelcome to our guide to the best Bitcoin exchange of 2018. This list is essential if you’re serious about making money from Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies .\nBut what is a Bitcoin exchange, and how can you be sure you sign up to the best Bitcoin exchange? Well, think of Bitcoin exchanges as digital marketplaces for people to buy and sell Bitcoins using different currencies. The Bitcoin can be exchanged for either fiat money (legal tender) or other alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. The exchange serves as the middleman for traders of the cryptocurrency.\nBeing able to purchase Bitcoin is the initial step to trading in it. Just like trading a stock, Bitcoin exchanges charge transaction fees, which range from 0 to 1%. In order to trade Bitcoin on an exchange, the user needs to have an account, and go through a series of steps to be verified. Remember that Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies are a completely digital currency, and there are no physical Bitcoins.\nHowever, before plunging in with both feet, users should be aware of what to look for in choosing a Bitcoin exchange for their cryptocurrency transactions. This is analogous to the issues and potential pitfalls in making a choice of where to do your banking, or open an online brokerage account. Furthermore, bear in mind that unlike banks and stock trading, Bitcoin trading is largely unregulated by most countries, although this is changing as its popularity increases.\nA good place to start is to look at the virtual coins which are supported by an exchange. With over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, and additional ones being added all the time, it is key to figure out which currencies you want to trade in, and then match the exchange that deals in those. For example, Ethereum mining has recently become more popular, but not all Bitcoin exchanges support this alternative cryptocurrency. Bitcoin vs distributed ledger vs Ethereum vs blockchain explained Language barriers\nNext look at the country that is hosting the Bitcoin exchange. Some are in less regulated countries, and there may be additional problems if something goes awry. This can include time differences, international long distance costs, and language barriers. In general, it’s preferable to find an exchange that speaks your language.\nAdditionally, pay close attention to the fees levied. While all these exchanges charge transaction fees – after all, they are businesses looking to make a profit – as the user, it is obviously best to find one with the lowest costs in order to maximize your own profits.\nAlso look for a secure trading platform, and a Bitcoin exchange which has robust security measures. After all, you wouldn’t use a bank that didn’t have a vault, and stored its money on the counter…\nDesirable security features include two-factor authentication, SMS or email alerts, encrypted emails, and wallet monitoring. A smartphone app can also be very useful in terms of accessing and monitoring funds – but equally, poorly implemented software can represent a security risk.\nFinally, look for an exchange which is doing a good volume of trading – in other words, one with a high number of trading pairs, and high liquidity.\nNow that we know the features to look for in the best Bitcoin exchanges, let’s move on to pick out our particular favorites.\nThis is a US-based exchange which was founded in 2012, and it supports over 32 countries. Coinbase exchanges Bitcoin and the alternative cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Litecoin, and it’s the largest of the exchanges, claiming $20 billion (£15 billion) in currency exchanged. In 2014 Coinbase created GDAX, the Global Digital Asset Exchange which was developed for professionals with high volumes of trading.\nThe firm offers a mobile wallet, offline storage, and insurance protection for currency stored on its servers. Coinbase supports several fiat currencies: British Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Singapore Dollars.\nThe Coinbase exchange has a 1% flat fee for each purchase, while cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are done without any fees. A streamlined user interface which is ideal for novice traders – and fast trades – makes Coinbase a popular exchange with traders.\nGemini Exchange is another US-based outfit founded by the Winklevoss twins – the pair who sued Mark Zuckerberg over social networking, and were awarded $65 million (£48 million), which they put to use as venture capitalists. This exchange is based in New York, and is available in 45 US states, as well as the UK, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nGemini’s only supported fiat currency is US dollars, and it only trades Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees, and levies a low flat rate of 0.25% for trades, to both the buyer and the seller.\nAnother advantage of Gemini is that it’s a New York state limited liability trust company, and is regulated by New York’s Department of Financial Services. Close proximity to the Wall Street financial markets allows the company to easily provide a bridge from more traditional investments to newer cryptocurrency markets, for both individual and institutional investors.\nGemini is also notable in that it accepts ACH transfers for fast access to money for trades. A potential downside is that the interface is not particularly novice-friendly.\nChangelly is a cryptocurrency exchange with support for many more virtual currencies than most, including Monero, Dash, Bytecoin, and DigitalNote among others. If you are mining a less popular currency, chances are that Changelly can exchange it for you.\nThis exchange comes from the popular mining platform MinerGate which provides a merged mining pool across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android operating systems. While Changelly focuses on exchanges between different cryptocurrencies, users can also purchase cryptocurrency with US Dollars or Euros.\nNote that this exchange has a shorter track record, as it only entered the market in 2016. Exchange fees are 0.5% on transactions.\nCryptopia was founded in 2014, aiming to be a comprehensive exchange that focuses on the user experience, with integration of additional services including a marketplace and wallet. It is based in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cryptopia is notable in that the first level of verification happens very quickly, and only requires an email address for initial verification.\nWhile Cryptopia does not support fiat money trading, it does support a ridiculously large number of cryptocurrencies: over 400 to date, with more being added all the time. The trading fee is also a low 0.20% per transaction, which compares favorably with many competitors. The website is quite large and sprawling, meaning that new users might find their first experiences with the site a little daunting.

schemes to the police, following the BTC Global scam .\nThis is according to a report in the City Press, which Quote: d Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi on the matter.\nThe number of “suspicious cryptocurrency investment schemes” reported to police is increasing, and over 1,000 people who lost money in the BTC Global scam have submitted affidavits on the matter.\nBTC Global, which promised extremely large returns over short periods of time if you sent them your Bitcoin, caught out over 27,000 people – including South Africans and Australians.\nAccording to the Hawks, over $50 million was lost in the BTC Global scam – with South Africans investing between R16,000 and R1.4 million each.\nA tree feller from Pretoria East said he put R100,000 into the scheme, when the “guaranteed 14% weekly returns” stopped coming in.\nThe City Press reported that another victim, a woman from Kempton Park, wanted to invest her pension payout in a high-return scheme, and a colleague suggested BTC Global.\nShe invested R62,000 in total – R30,000 for herself, R17,000 for her husband, and R15,000 for her son.\nOf that, she lost R44,000 when BTC Global collapsed.\nMore cases The City Press has now reported that more people “are coming in every day” with reports of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment schemes and how they lost money.\nThe warning signs of the latest Bitcoin schemes include financial rewards for recruiting new members, and larger payouts for larger numbers of investors in the pool.\nTo avoid becoming a victim to a Bitcoin scheme , thoroughly research before investing your money.\nIn the case of BTC Global, it was run by “master trader” Steven Twain. A search for Twain showed he did not exist, however.\nThe Consumer Protection Act also describes any scheme that offers returns of 20% above the repo rate as a “multiplication scheme” – otherwise known as a Ponzi scheme.\nNow read: The New Age’s new website was mining cryptocurrency bitcoin BTC Global Headline", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mybroadband.everlytic.net/public/contacts/subscription"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hangwani mulaudzi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "city press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kempton park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pretoria east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T08:19:39.096+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a6a58f635dd736f9d1699f08bf7aa85918f2740", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz9XIdcKwFHsRElodjzV9_O4-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-03T08:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a6a58f635dd736f9d1699f08bf7aa85918f2740", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz9XIdcKwFHsRElodjzV9_O4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T08:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 3, 2018 NEWS BCH Powered Charity 'Eat BCH' Starts Feeding People in South Sudan Bitcoin News (press release) Back in April, news.

A start of the day $7,441.5 low held above the day’s first major support level at $7,373.8 leading to a mid-morning rally through the day’s first major resistance level at $7,644.04 to an intraday high $7,698.8 before easing back below the major resistance level by the day’s end. Bitcoin’s mid-morning surge left the rest of the day relatively range bound, with Bitcoin’s only test being a mid-afternoon intraday high $7,698.8 and afternoon low $7,590.0. A move was expected and Bitcoin delivered, though for the Bitcoin bulls, falling short of $7,700 levels and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,738 continued to leave the extended bearish trend intact, with a pullback to 29 th May’s swing lo 7,040 and sub-$7,000 levels still on the cards. Market sensitivity towards regulatory chatter remains an issue for the cryptomarket and, while the week has delivered some relief for Bitcoin, any material recovery to bring $10,000 levels into play will remain some way off for now. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was flat at $7,638.3, recovering from a morning $7,600 low in what’s been a relative choppy start to the day, Bitcoin hitting an intraday high $7,668.1 before the morning’s low that held well above the day’s first major support level at $7,486.8. Holding at $7,600 will have been the positive through the morning, while Bitcoin has yet to test key resistance levels, with the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,438 and the day’s first major resistance level at $7,744.1 some way off. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning’s $7,668.1 high would support a run at $7,000 levels, with the Bitcoin bulls targeting the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,738 to support an near-term bullish trend. Failure to move back through the morning’s high to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level would support a pullback, with any slide back to $7,500 levels likely to bring the day’s first major support level at $7,486.8 into play, with broader market sentiment to have a hand in the level of support Bitcoin will find at sub-$7,500 levels, the bears continuing to eye sub-$7,000 levels before letting go of the reins. In spite of the possible downside and concerns over the regulatory outlook, Bitcoin will likely find support through the morning, though investors will need to look out for a late in the day reversal ahead of the new week, with concerns over possible negative news likely to limit the upside potential following three consecutive days of gains. Elsewhere in the cryptomarket, Monero’s XMR led the way with a 2.55% gain at the time of writing, while EOS was the worst performer, down 1.74% off the back of the end to its 1-year initial coin offering that was reported to have raised $4bn.

BCH\\/USD has to move above $1,100 to accelerate gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThis past week, there were mostly range moves below $1,040 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price was struggling to gain pace above the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels. Finally, there was an upside break and the price settled above the $1,040 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). During the upside move, the price broke many hurdles, including the $1,000 barrier.\nMoreover, there was a break above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,323 swing high to $871 low. More importantly, there was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $980 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely in a positive zone above $1,040.

Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Also, let's say you are one step away from imprisonment,\nbecause of bad debt, would you sell a kidney or another organ for bitcoins to stay out of jail?\n#Remember : In my opinion it is WRONG to do this, but I am just creating a hypothetical situation to satisfy my curiosity.\nNo, I wouldn't ever sell my organ for me to get some bitcoin or cash. It is because when I sell my organ, there is something that I will feel has left inside my body, and that is irritating or worrying that maybe if I move I will die LOL. Kidding aside, it is true that your body will not function as normally do due to the fact that there is a part of your body that is removed.

Turning Bullish Bitcoin Cash rallied 8.26% on Saturday, following Friday’s 1.22% rise, to end the day at $1,085. An early dip to an intraday low $990.3 was the only bearish move of the day, with Bitcoin Cash’s struggles of breaking out from $1,000 coming to an end through the morning. A late afternoon rally saw Bitcoin Cash rally to an intraday high $1,102.9, breaking through the day’s major resistance levels to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 for the first time since 22 nd May, before easing back to sub-$1,100 levels by the day’s end. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 0.29% to $1,081, with an early attempted break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 leading to a pullback to a morning low $1,072.2 before a partial recovery. For the day ahead, breaking through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level will be key to continue supporting the bearish trend reversal, with Bitcoin Cash’s pullback from $1,100 late on Saturday continuing to leave the extended bearish trend intact, with a slide back to $800 levels still possible near-term. Failure to move through $1,100 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $1,128.5 will likely weigh on Bitcoin Cash, to bring sub-$1,000 levels into play later in the day, investors likely to hold off for another dip. Holding on to $1,000 levels in the early part of the day should continue to support a positive day ahead. BCH/USD 03/06/18 4-Hourly Chart Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today Litecoin Looking to Slide Litecoin gained 3.14% on Saturday, following Friday’s 1.34% rise, to end the day at $123.65, its highest close since 23 rd May’s $128.38. Recovering from a start of the day intraday low $118.52, Litecoin rallied through the day’s first major resistance level at $121.52 in the late morning, before an afternoon rally saw Litecoin move through to $123 levels to test the day’s second major resistance level at $123.08 and hold, whilst falling short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $127, to leave the extended bearish trend intact. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 0.74% to $122.74, with Litecoin pulling back from an early $123.97 high to an intraday low $122.56, Saturday’s gains under threat in the early part of the day as investors look to lock in profits ahead of the next move. For the day ahead, a move through to $123.5 would support another run at $124 levels, with a break through to $124.4 bringing the day’s first major resistance level at $125.9 into play, while the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $127 will likely remain out of reach through the day. Failure to break through to $124 levels through the day will likely see Litecoin pullback to $121 levels, with any deterioration in sentiment across the cryptomarket likely to see the day’s first major support level at $119.96 tested before any recovery.

He has a three phase technical process to follow trend shifts across markets. The methodology allows him to track the relative performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to forecast leadership rotations within the Fundstrat Crypto FX10 Large-cap and FX tokens.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n[Author’s note: There is no official price for Bitcoin, so I use round numbers.]\nBitcoin broke a downward pattern in April, peaked in early May after what appeared to be pressure from tax loss selling and has been in another downtrend for almost a month. Sluymer believes that “while it is premature to conclude the correction is over, there was a positive technical development this week suggesting the first stage of a three stage bottoming process is developing. Short-term momentum indicators are beginning to bottom.”\nHe sees this as the first phase as momentum indicators begin to decelerate or bottom . This is the second derivative of growth rates, which a number of investors use to help determine when an asset is nearing its low.\nThe chart below Y-axis is on a linear scale. It shows Bitcoin’s downtrend from its high of about $20,000 in December through early April. It bottomed around $6,500 and then broke the downtrend in the middle of the month by moving up to $9,500. However, it began another downtrend in May and is around $7,600 currently.\nStockCharts.com Bitcoin price chart with linear scale\nThis second chart has a logarithmic scale Y-axis. It essentially shows the same downward trends but they are not as sharp as the linear scale graph. Also both graphs show Bitcoin’s RSI or Relative Strength Index (the top portion of both graphs) being in an oversold condition. While the current 36.78 RIS reading isn’t as low as the two previous ones, it is close and is an indication that Bitcoin could be set up for at least a short-term bounce.\nStockCharts.com Bitcoin price chart with logarithmic scale\nSluymer is seeing multiple tokens starting to improve vs. Bitcoin . Of the 10 largest capitalized tokens he believes that EOS and TRX or TRON are exhibiting strong relative performance to Bitcoin and for the next 40 largest GNT or Golem, MIOTA or IOTA, ZRX or 0x and WTC or Waltonchain are at the early stages of relative leadership.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fchuckjones%2F2018%2F06%2F02%2Ffundstrat-strategist-believes-bitcoin-could-be-bottoming%2F&text=He%20sees%20this%20as%20the%20first%20phase%20as%20momentum%20indicators%20begin%20to%20decelerate%20or%20bottom", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fchuckjones%2F2018%2F06%2F02%2Ffundstrat-strategist-believes-bitcoin-could-be-bottoming%2F&text=Sluymer%20is%20seeing%20multiple%20tokens%20starting%20to%20improve%20vs.%20Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T01:46:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "acf30906dcf04b6c68db5dca1883e9ccf620e08a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKeo6Qv4AGs5iH2BLFImn7UQrUil5bsDQCuCwfUkmP0sAGMyG3eDa8nQ7bBwPp9NjUg6Jqgsl5SXg-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.ca", "site": "freelancer.ca", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.ca/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Build A Website (Dealing with Bitcoin)", "title_full": "Build A Website (Dealing with Bitcoin)", "published": "2018-06-03T06:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "acf30906dcf04b6c68db5dca1883e9ccf620e08a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKeo6Qv4AGs5iH2BLFImn7UQrUil5bsDQCuCwfUkmP0sAGMyG3eDa8nQ7bBwPp9NjUg6Jqgsl5SXg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T06:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Build A Website (Dealing with Bitcoin)", "text": "Build A Website (Dealing with Bitcoin)\nBudget is $200 please confirm you understand this.\nIf you put over budget i'm sorry you will not be accepted.\nI am after a website with certain pages and certain special effects.\nThe budget has already been decided.

Current statistics show the BCH chain will halve its reward from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH on or around April 6, 2020, and with more than 80 percent of BCH now in circulation, when the next halving takes place the decentralized asset will be much harder to obtain. Also read: Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Has Less Than Two Years Left Until the 2020 Reward Halving Bitcoin Cash has great worth to a lot of digital asset proponents and the cryptocurrency has gained in value tremendously over the past nine months. One benefit that BCH advocates appreciate is the fact that the currency has digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million BCH in existence and right now there is a circulating supply of 17.1 million. More than 80 percent of BCH has been mined into existence since the end of April and the BCH hashrate has been around 3.5 to 4.5 exahash per second. At this speed alone, with just 13 mining pools, the next halving date will be on or around April 6, 2020 . After this date, BCH miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 BCH) and receive 6.25 BCH and fees per block mined. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol is set to halve its block reward on or around the year 2020 depending on hashrate speed. Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts appreciate the fact that BCH will grow gradually harder to obtain over time due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s built-in supply limit, which introduced a different kind of ‘digital scarcity’ — one that’s backed by the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. This day in age, with computer files like MP3s or JPEGs, we typically think about these digital items differently because they are easily duplicated. The decentralized currency BCH cannot be duplicated so easily, as it’s re-enforced by 3.5 to 4.5 exahash of power validating all the ledger transactions. The system keeps miners sincere because they are economically incentivized to stay honest, unlike traditional systems and public officials trusted today. As time goes by and the mining hashrate continues to increase, the BCH network becomes much more expensive to besiege by making a 51% or double spend attack harder every passing day. No More Quantitative Easing or Bailouts Digital scarcity makes Bitcoin Cash far more valuable than the fiat notes printed by governments and central banks because the code does not allow for mass fiat printing and quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar, for example, has been devalued considerably over time making it lose purchasing power year after year. Extreme USD printing began after the adoption of the Bretton Woods system, throughout the eighties and nineties and then with the bailed-out banks who received billions of printed dollars after the 2008 ‘economic crisis.’ Bitcoin Cash will always be finite and allow users to conserve or spend, because their ownership is defined by a protocol that continues to strengthen its security daily. There is no monetary system out there that allows for true transferable digital value like Satoshi Nakamoto’s clever invention. Satoshi put a cap on the supply for a reason and this can be seen in the genesis block’s famous text. After April 6, 2020, in another four years or less the reward will again halve, and continue to halve until the last coins are found on or around the year 2140. Halvings in the past have shown consistent price rises following these events, which confirms proponents appreciate the genius of Nakamoto’s digital scarcity. Sending people a nice fraction of BCH is cool, but people will also admire how scarce the decentralized asset is unlike the devalued fiat currencies in their wallet.

The International Monetary Fund seems confident there is no need to regulate this industry at this stage, even though other officials see things differently. Dong He of the IMF is convinced that cryptocurrencies may replace central bank money in the future, but now is not the time. Dong He on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency It is always interesting to note how different financial experts perceive the future of cryptocurrency. Considering that this new form of money is still incredibly volatile, it is evident that there is a lot of work to be done moving forward. The IMF’s Dong He, for one, wrote that the cryptocurrency industry is far too volatile to pose any threat to the fiat currencies which people use today. That doesn’t mean this situation will not change in the future. The way things stand right now, there is a growing interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which may disrupt the financial sector sooner rather than later. At this stage, however, the main focus should be on stabilizing the Bitcoin price, but that will be difficult to achieve. One thing holding global cryptocurrency adoption back is its technical deficiencies. While Bitcoin has a high value as of right now, it is rather evident that scaling solutions need to be implemented sooner rather than later. The Lightning Network may change a lot of things, although it remains to be seen how powerful this technology will really be when everything is said and done. Central banks suffer from deficiencies as well, though. Competitive pressure brought to the table by crypto assets means central banks will need to step up their game. Conducting effective monetary policy, for example, will remain one of their top priorities. Additionally, it seems a lot of banks are preparing to offer exposure to various cryptocurrencies moving forward. In some cases, it is better to embrace competition than oppose inevitable change. In Dong He’s words: There are both challenges and opportunities for central banks in the digital age. Central banks must maintain the public’s trust in fiat currencies and stay in the game in a digital, sharing, and decentralized service economy. They can remain relevant by providing more stable units of account than crypto assets and by making central bank money attractive as a medium of exchange in the digital economy. Depending on how things evolve, cryptocurrencies could fulfill “more of the functions of money in some regions”, according to Dong He. That is a rather interesting comment, although it doesn’t mean there will be any major shifts in this regard. For central banks, it is of the utmost importance to keep tabs on any developments in these innovative industries, and perhaps jump on the bandwagon when the time arises. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dong he of the imf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T04:15:40.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f17a6305ad2fa48382be464d643311c28d43a71a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCjlbqjc6v8I5PejDTyeWAfQpuMMy0jC9QYkVBBR1WJ0cpKPy2vtWplgOqCRwM9SBvBKeVMDxUULyJDIUPdt9GQbz2lf3ayL6xzh57exQNkEa9FS5gPRoyzg--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Expects Altcoin Markets to Decouple from Bitcoin", "title_full": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Expects Altcoin Markets to Decouple from Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-03T06:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527984498_24742956.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f17a6305ad2fa48382be464d643311c28d43a71a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCjlbqjc6v8I5PejDTyeWAfQpuMMy0jC9QYkVBBR1WJ0cpKPy2vtWplgOqCRwM9SBvBKeVMDxUULyJDIUPdt9GQbz2lf3ayL6xzh57exQNkEa9FS5gPRoyzg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T06:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Expects Altcoin Markets to Decouple from Bitcoin", "text": "12 hours ago Crypto World News The Merkle 100 There is never a lack of controversy in the world of cryptocurrency. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Bitcoin will not remain the “gold standard” of cryptocurrencies for much longer. Instead, he is convinced that altcoins will carve out their own paths and no longer rely on Bitcoin’s price momentum. Brad Garlinghouse has Some Contrarian Views Anyone who has paid attention to the cryptocurrency industry for more than three weeks will have noticed an interesting trend. Regardless of how successful or promising some altcoins may be, they will not thrive unless the Bitcoin price is going up. It is a very annoying trend which has hindered the growth of altcoins for some time now, unfortunately. It will be quite difficult to reverse this trend, assuming that’s possible. Surprisingly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is convinced things will change in favor of the altcoins fairly soon. Although he doesn’t deny the correlation between the price of XRP and the value of Bitcoin, he believes there may be a shift on the horizon. As one would expect, his statement has faced some opposition, even though most people would welcome such a change. While the cryptocurrency scene is still in its infancy after nine years, the time has come for altcoins to emerge and carve out their own paths. Whether or not any of them will be able to do so in the near future is a different matter altogether. With speculation remaining one of the bigger problems affecting market growth, there will not be any exciting developments in favor of the altcoins anytime soon. According to Garlinghouse, the decoupling of altcoin markets from Bitcoin will take place through “investor rationale”. In his view, it’s only a matter of time until investors see the value in individual cryptocurrencies and their respective technologies. At the same time, Garlinghouse believes certain altcoins will continue to ride the coattails of Bitcoin. Indeed, there have been a fair few cryptocurrencies coming to market which serve no real purpose and have no active use cases. Nor will they have any, by the look of things, even though such currencies remain extremely appealing to cryptocurrency speculators. While the comments from Garlinghouse are pretty interesting, it remains to be seen if any of his predictions will come true. After all, Bitcoin has dominated the cryptocurrency industry for quite some time now, despite the Bitcoin Dominance Index dropping below 40% this year. An interesting situation is unfolding in the cryptocurrency industry, but nothing has been set in stone just yet. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T04:15:15.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c46c1894072d93379730286cbce0dae5dd3a8a95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCOFEnsc1kzc08pjeiCXp5CUorc6nsQ3g422GXNeGgM9gzwuTa_yA1.hoTrTfXjeOvPyLwd02nTOtwuCnNbmAnFRot5A.rqcca9Htj0Ajr3VhqQd3o56KsGg--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Economist Claims Bitcoin Bubble Is Still in the Early Profit-Taking Stages", "title_full": "Economist Claims Bitcoin Bubble Is Still in the Early Profit-Taking Stages", "published": "2018-06-03T06:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527962898_90633437.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c46c1894072d93379730286cbce0dae5dd3a8a95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCOFEnsc1kzc08pjeiCXp5CUorc6nsQ3g422GXNeGgM9gzwuTa_yA1.hoTrTfXjeOvPyLwd02nTOtwuCnNbmAnFRot5A.rqcca9Htj0Ajr3VhqQd3o56KsGg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T06:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Economist Claims Bitcoin Bubble Is Still in the Early Profit-Taking Stages", "text": "7 hours ago Crypto World News The Merkle 83 It is only to be expected that economists and other financial experts remain wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at this stage. After the onslaught which traders have witnessed throughout most of 2018, the future price direction remains unclear. Economist Joost van der Burgt is confident Bitcoin will fall even further in value pretty soon. Another Doom Scenario for Bitcoin Anyone who has paid attention to Bitcoin price predictions over the past year may have noticed that financial ‘experts’ don’t expect a bright future for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That is not entirely surprising, especially considering that the year 2018 hasn’t been too positive so far. Even so, optimism remains in place overall, as bigger and better things seem on the horizon for this industry. If economist Joost van der Burgt is to be believed, the future will not look all that bright. More specifically, he is confident that Bitcoin is still in a massive bubble as of right now. Assuming that is the case, this may only be the beginning of the profit-taking stage. This seems to indicate van der Burgt is confident the Bitcoin price will drop below $5,000 soon, although most market speculators envision an entirely different future. Up to this point, there has been no evidence of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency being in a bubble. While it is true that volatility has reigned supreme throughout most of 2018, this is no different from how the market has evolved in the past few years. Bitcoin’s price is still relatively easy to manipulate, but it seems new regulatory developments will make cryptocurrency a lot more attractive to the mainstream. According to van der Burgt, the Bitcoin “bubble” is now entering a euphoric stage. He compares the current cryptocurrency price trend with the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis. It’s a very interesting comparison, even though the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by a culmination of multiple factors, rather than hype for a specific project or offering. The economist noted: The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments. According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance. At the same time, one has to acknowledge cryptocurrencies are very different from any investment vehicle the world has seen before. While it may not necessarily become the new breed of global currencies, there appear to be many use cases for Bitcoin and other worthwhile currencies. That doesn’t mean every altcoin will succeed, but the future isn’t looking as gloomy as van der Burght would like people to believe. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doom scenario for bitcoin anyone", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T04:15:34.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f85bd5b0f53049fe3380357d2113a149cc3597ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgN.Ix37ROcyEfKccnB5TsC7KuLwr_UxobmEmP.IyQhxw5hFP31CLlfnbFt1DpaK1Iah_1lmR9_NE-", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Is IBM a Better Bet Long-Term than Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is IBM a Better Bet Long-Term than Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-03T06:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f85bd5b0f53049fe3380357d2113a149cc3597ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgN.Ix37ROcyEfKccnB5TsC7KuLwr_UxobmEmP.IyQhxw5hFP31CLlfnbFt1DpaK1Iah_1lmR9_NE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-06-03T06:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is IBM a Better Bet Long-Term than Bitcoin?", "text": "Most people agree that investing in cryptocurrency in 2017 was an easy endeavor.

coming from privacy focused alts such as monero who are framing the public ledger of bitcoin as being some sort of detriment to its longterm utility.\nLet's allay those concerns by looking at the bigger picture here...\nShould an opaque ledger such as monero become the dominant currency, we would eventually end up with the exact same levels of subterfuge and corruption that bought the current system to its knees (through hidden shell companies and dodgy offshore accounts routed through complex financial instruments) that only a select few of the 'in-group' are privy to.\nIn contrast, a transparent, global ledger allows us to hold those who are custodians of public funds to account; enabling glass governance, as well as allowing ethical corporations to expose their supply chains to public scrutiny.\nThe more corporations that do this, the more consumers have a choice to 'vote with their pocketbooks' and deal only with companies that they deem align with their own set of moral standards.\nFor example: if you don't want to be buying an engagement ring that's been involved in the blood diamond trade, you might choose to use a company that has exposed its supply chain on the global ledger to provide you with immutable proof that your purchase has an ethical supply chain.\nThis does not mean we have to expose our own financial lives to the public. Don't want your girlfriend to know you've bought her that diamond ring? Buy it with lightning network and you will be afforded a much greater degree of individual privacy provisioning. Kinda' like the incognito window in Chrome in that respect.\nThe key here is ensuring we maintain a public ledger that allows us to insist on full exposure for public officials, institutions and government bodies that should already be expected to be transparent in their actions and accountable to the citizenry funding them.\nThis ultimately leads to a world where public representatives taking backhanders from lobbyists and greasing the palms of those in the 'old boys network' becomes a thing of the past due to the increase in crowd-based scrutiny and the ease by which automated algorithms will be able to immediately flag conflicts of interest that might otherwise take decades of research to uncover. It's currently very easy to cover up a government contract being awarded to your 'mates' with a Swiss bank account or offshore shell company... Try that on a public blockchain however and you're going to be immediately held to account by a crowd of watchers.\nWhilst privacy focused coins like monero will still have niche use cases in countries suffering from oppressive regimes (much like VPNs and TOR are essential tools for even the most basic of internet actions in such places), the vast majority of us will champion the more open public nature of bitcoin as a settlement layer, as it means all that increased public scrutiny will eventually lead to a system where we will have a direct influence over where our economic energy is spent, and even see our contributions being put to work in realtime instead of disappearing into a government spending sink hole...\nIn a monero-esque world, all the cheating we have seen happening is actually amplified to extremes since there would be even less accountability than there is in the current rigged system.\nWhereas bitcoin leads to a system of radical transparency that finally puts an end to scandals such as the Cambridge Analytica Brexit debacle (where electoral funding rules were broken).\nThis could never happen if their accounts had to run through the bitcoin public ledger and were vetted in realtime by the electorate.\nIn essence, through transparency we end up with a system where everyone is incentivised to play nicely and, in doing so, we move beyond those old world zero sum games that are no longer fit for purpose in a global world that has realised consensus and collaborative networks are the best way of evolving those archaic hierarchical institutions and the species itself.\n submitted by /u/smeggletoot\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

The same study also corroborated the so-called â€œopen-access citation advantageâ€ â€“ finding that OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. Mandates to authors and publishers from the Wellcome Trust as well as various governments have advanced the OA cause considerably â€“ and raised many questions for all the key stakeholders in academia. Indeed, the evolving relationship of publishers and institutional libraries particularly faces critical challenges.â€ At the link right-click â€œDownloadâ€ and select â€œSave Link Asâ€ from the pop-up menu.\nOpioid Epidemic Overview 7 mins – â€œ North America is in the midst of its most serious drug-overdose crisis in history. From 1999 through 2015, drug-overdose deaths approximately tripled in the United States, and the majority of such deaths now involve an opioid. In 2016 alone, there were 64,000 drug-overdose deaths in the United States â€” more than the total number of U.S. military deaths during the Vietnam War. As a result, and despite gains in other areas of medicine and public health, the United States recently experienced its first major decline in life expectancy since 1993â€Ś.â€ At the link right-click â€œDownloadâ€ and select â€œSave Link Asâ€ from the pop-up menu.\nOsteopathic Medicine 43 mins – â€œToday, I speak with Dr. William “Bill” Mayo, the President-Elect of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and a practicing ophthalmologist.

On this month’s edition of The Enright Files, we revisit interviews with thinkers who make the case for philosophyâ€™s enduring relevance, particularly as our lives and our society becomes more enmeshed in technology.â€ At the link find the title, â€œThe Enright Files: Philosophy outside the Ivory Tower, May, 2018,â€ right-click â€œ Media files ideas-JoRi3Eov-20180507.mp3â€ and select â€œSave Link Asâ€ from the pop-up menu.\nPolice Management 22 mins – â€œ Can anything cure what ails America?

The problem has been addressed countless times since the nationâ€™s founding, but it persists, and for the poorest among us, it gets worse. America has not been able to find its way to a sustainable solution, because most of its citizens see the problem of poverty from a distance, through a distorted lens. So in 2016, we presented “Busted: America’s Poverty Myths,” a series exploring how our understanding of poverty is shaped not by facts, but by private presumptions, media narratives, and the tales of the American Dream. This week we’re revisiting part of that series.â€ At the link right click â€œDownloadâ€ and select â€œSave link Asâ€ from the pop-up menu.\nPresidential Job 47 mins – â€œ How the presidency became impossibleâ€”weâ€™ll talk to John Dickerson about why he thinks the job is simply too much for anyone.” At the link right-click the down-pointing arrow under the play button and select â€œSave Link Asâ€ from the pop-up menu.\nPsychological Misconceptions 75 mins – â€œ We all like to throw around terms that describe human behavior â€” â€œbystander apathyâ€ and â€œsteep learning curveâ€ and â€œhard-wired.â€ Most of the time, they don’t actually mean what we think they mean.

Live and let live, right? To each her own. But whatâ€™s the tipping point at which thy neighbor becomes simply too numerous, too loud, too different to ignore? Iâ€™d submit that whoever you are. Wherever you locate yourself on that spectrum of tolerance. You too, have your limits. In the mid 1980s, a group of people in Oregon discovered their tipping point when a massive commune moved in next door. The Baghwan Shree Rajneesh and thousands of his followers decided to build a city in the middle of nowhereâ€”a utopia on Earth. Only it was the middle of somewhere for the mostly white, mostly Christian residents of a tiny nearby town. It was home, and like most humans, they werenâ€™t too excited about the idea of radical, unexpected change in their own backyard. I, on the other hand, am very excited to be here today with the Way Brothers â€” Chaplain and MacLainâ€Ś Theyâ€™re the directors of the fabulous Netflix documentary Wild, Wild, Country, which tells the very American story of this clash of cultures. Thereâ€™s god, guns, sex, and mutually exclusive concepts of liberty. Like I said – itâ€™s about as American as it gets.â€ At the link find the title, â€œ143.

The Rajneeshees had millions of dollars at their disposal and an ideology based on meditation, raising consciousness and free love â€” one that Bhagwanâ€™s young American and European followers found seemingly irresistible. And oneÂ that the local people in the adjacent town of Antelope, Oregon, population 40, saw as an evil threat. Cult or utopian project? Menace or marvel?

Instead, weâ€™re going to focus on two really specific pieces of this topic. First we talk to Madeline Ashby, futurist and science fiction writer, about robots, and what it might be like if we replaced human law enforcement with robotic law enforcement. Then, we talk to historian and writer Walidah Imarisha, about a future with no cops at all.

Gene therapy, healthier crops, safer, more efficient forms of nuclear energy? Very nice, very nice. But what about eugenics, climate change, and Fukushima? For every problem human ingenuity solves, doesnâ€™t human nature create a new one, on a bigger scale? Dammit, Spock, can your cold, calculating reason fathom the mysteries of the human heart? But you know what? After devouring all 453 pages and 75 graphs of psychologist Steven Pinkerâ€™s new book ENLIGHTENMENT NOW, I admit defeat. The defeat of defeatism. This man has done the math.

Then I found my tribeâ€”the drama nerds. Maybe we couldnâ€™t beat you up, but you had to respect the artistry. In high school, Tribalism was power. My guest today is Yale Law professor Amy Chua, who shook the Internet up a few years back with her book BATTLE HYMN OF THE TIGER MOTHER. What upset some progressive American parents most, it seems, was the suggestion that they were members of a parenting tribe. A cultural bubble with its own fallible set of assumptions. In her powerful new book POLITICAL TRIBES: GROUP INSTINCT AND THE FATE OF NATIONS, Amy points out that long past high school, group instinct is much stronger than Americans generally like to admit.

Belew, who has spent more than 10 years studying America’s White Power movement, traces the movement’s rise to the end of the Vietnam War, and the feeling among some “white power” veterans that the country had betrayed them. “To be clear, I’m not arguing that this is at all representative of Vietnam veterans â€” this is a tiny, tiny percentage of returning veterans,” Belew says. “But it is a large and instrumental number of people within the White Power movement â€” and they play really important roles in changing the course of movement action.” In her new book, Bring the War Home, Belew argues that as disparate racist groups came together, the movement’s goal shifted from one of “vigilante activism” to something more wide-reaching: “It’s aimed at unseating the federal government. … It’s aimed at undermining infrastructure and currency to foment race war.” At the link right-click â€œDownloadâ€ and select â€œSave Link Asâ€ from the pop-up menu.\nWomen Entrepreneurs 29 mins – â€œSilicon Valley is leaving money on the table, and Arlan Hamilton will go to extremes to prove it.
