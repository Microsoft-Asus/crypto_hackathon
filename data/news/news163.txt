Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin price today, however, retreated below $8K yesterday and is trading around $7,300 today. Source Image: coinmarketcap.com\nTechnical analysts are forecasting the bearish trend will extend its momentum while trend makers and business icons are also presenting a bleak outlook for the entire cryptocurrency market. Does Tom Lee’s Claim Make Sense?\nCryptocurrencies are the most volatile asset in the world, at least in this era. This is because everything is a possibility in this market; crypto coins have created such major rallies in the past, including last year’s rally – when Bitcoin price rose from $1,000 to $20,000.\nAt the moment, however, the market is much more mature and traders are closely inspecting all the pros and cons of digital currencies. Regulator interference and bans from several countries have also wiped off the illegal trading volume – which accounted for almost half of the trading volume during last years bull-run.\nTom Lee has totally based his price bet on speculation that institutional investors will push prices higher later in the year.\nHe said , “ I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies .” Market Reaction Source Image: twitter.com\nMarket reaction to Tom Lee’s claims was mixed. Some are going against his bet while others are optimistic about the future upside potential. Tom Lee, however, didn’t express his thoughts regarding Bitcoin’s potential to work as viable currency. He also didn’t speak about the “fair value” concept.

Finally, we have seen Bitcoin Cash tumble below $1,000.00 into figures not seen since the middle of April.\nDuring April, Bitcoin Cash made incredible progression during the mid-April market surge, progression which saw it break free from the path of Bitcoin and take up new heights on its own. Prior to the surge, Bitcoin Cash seemed to remain steadily at 10% of the value of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin hit $7,000.00, Bitcoin Cash remained at $700.00. The surge in April however saw Bitcoin Cash move on from this imprisonment. Leading up to a period in time where we almost saw Bitcoin Cash hit $2,000.00.\nAs the market downfall took over, Bitcoin Cash remained resilient. This was down to a pending hard fork through Bitcoin ABC, designed to increase the scalability and the block size of the blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. The fork, was carried out successfully and thus, allowed Bitcoin Cash to balance at around $1,200.00. Now though, with the hype behind the fork passed us, Bitcoin Cash has finally fallen victim to the impact of this market depression.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash is valued at $975.99, down 7.70%. Overall, this retreat below $1,000.00 may very well see Bitcoin Cash struggle to move upwards beyond this point for some time now. Moreover, Bitcoin Cash is now as risk of falling into the trap set by Bitcoin. What I mean here is that, should Bitcoin Cash reach a value of around 10% the value of Bitcoin, we may see Bitcoin Cash move back into Bitcoins shadow, meaning that for the time being, it will consistently remain as a 10% portion of the Bitcoin value.\nJust as Bitcoin Cash finally grew the momentum to take Bitcoin on, we are seeing the rise of this currency fall back down, in an unfortunate turn of events.\nWhat next for Bitcoin Cash?\nWell of course, we could see this blip, rectified. Hopefully this will be the case. Moreover, if Bitcoin Cash stays out of the Bitcoin shadow, we might very well see Bitcoin Cash make a recovery far quicker than expected. At the moment, a move up towards $1,000.00 would be ideal. If we see this target reached over the next few days then we can have some confidence that the currency still has the ability to move, independent of Bitcoin. If it does fall down though, Bitcoin Cash will see resistance going forward.\nFor now, we should wait and see what happens. Of course, Bitcoin Cash is influenced by the overall market, so until the markets tun around, this decline is sure to continue.

The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.”\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company’s operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX.\nIn Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o\n— Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018 Ripple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks.\nShould Bitcoin Be Used by Banks? Many token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin’s genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer. Instead of going through a bank, users could set up their own wallets and send transactions without using a bank, but novices may find this risky as mistakes can happen.\n* * *\nThe question is - will this enable BMV customers to get around any future capital controls enforced by the government should this currency collapse turn even more crisis-er?\nTags Business Finance Banks - NEC Real Estate Development & Operations - NEC Investment Management & Fund Operators - NEC Corporate Accounting Services", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mercury_fx_ltd/status/989427097809629184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/xRapid?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://ripple.com/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/09/coinone-transfer-joins-ripplenet-revolutionize-cross-border-payments/", "https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-genesis-block-bitcoin-terms/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/500-million-mistakenly-sent-ethereums-genesis-address/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/13/ripple-partners-santander-new-foreign-exchange-app/", "https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/solutions/services.html", "https://bitex.la/", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/argentinian-bank-now-using-bitcoin-for-cross-border-transactions", "https://www.bancomasventas.com.ar/bitex-principal"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim copeland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph bank moves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsbtc.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin templeton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:57:47.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f8b26f4cc427307ac0af3266592a7e03c919899", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9D9nsds3WY99zK509ZTSA01ztXN6n36Gi_yAEdN4SZ.KiGSV2XoI_Wd_672TD_je_hrJ_ojUAO8WSvDEFJ4m9GPX59q80kRHXG0tMBLE9ygDQqK1hxKg8DJ4MXF7F1Af3dj8ZRsJ0iqq0uO64dzSq2GNxZPjpHnRk0wTstWrd_w--", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple price prediction: Top 3 short-term analysis", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple price prediction: Top 3 short-term analysis", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Bitcoin/bitcoin_3_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f8b26f4cc427307ac0af3266592a7e03c919899", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9D9nsds3WY99zK509ZTSA01ztXN6n36Gi_yAEdN4SZ.KiGSV2XoI_Wd_672TD_je_hrJ_ojUAO8WSvDEFJ4m9GPX59q80kRHXG0tMBLE9ygDQqK1hxKg8DJ4MXF7F1Af3dj8ZRsJ0iqq0uO64dzSq2GNxZPjpHnRk0wTstWrd_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple price prediction: Top 3 short-term analysis", "text": "Negative short-term scenarios across the Crypto board Lost and remaining support levels focus the attention of traders\nThe Crypto sell-off continues in the main Cryptocurrencies , with meaningful short-term supports being broken. Today's resistances (yesterday's supports) have been tested in the early European session, but it doesn't look likely that the lost levels will be recovered.\nBTC/USD 4H chart\nBTC/USD reached yesterday during the American session the support located at the $7500 mark, with a low located at $7442. This is the key level to watch right now, as falling just one pip below it would bring the Bitcoin price down to $7100. There is not any strong support at $7000, and a potential fall to $6850 looks more than likely.\nOn the upside, the scenario is complex, as any bullish attempts will meat two important trendlines, multiple price congestion resistances and every meaningful moving average. These are the all the key resistance levels: $7670, $7850, $7975, $8103, $8196, $8513 and finally at the 200-SMA the $8871 mark.\nMACD in the Bitcoin 4-hour chart is still crossed to the downside, although with less inclination than yesterday. It still has enough room to cover before setting up for possible bullish attempts. The bulls might try a run in the intraday charts, and if they succeed, they would take Bitcoin back to the superior channel, improving a bit the technical outlook for the upcoming sessions.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same charts shows the sellers losing some strength and located below the ADX, the first indicator of a loss of strength. Buyers have reacted to the $7500 level with some interest, which might be positive for the price action.\nETH/USD 4H chart\nEthereum is following a similar pattern than Bitcoin, although it still has not been able to recover the lost support at all. This is a textbook bearish breakout confirmation movement that now is heading down to $565, already reached during Asian trading. If that level is broken to the downside, free room to the $475-$500 area.\nOn the upside, there are fewer resistances than in the Bitcoin outlook we just saw. The key levels for the bulls to beat are $608, $620, $660, $667 and a very important resistance at the $700 level, where there is a confluence of an important price congestion level, the 100-SMA and the 200-SMA.\nMACD in the Ethereum 4-hour chart is continuing its trajectory to the downside, although with less inclination than yesterday. It still has some room to the downside, so we need to consider as very likely a run down to lower supports.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is showing the sellers losing some strength, while buyers are reacting with a small advance to the current levels. ADX is still at very high levels, with the loss of strength being quite likely for the upcoming periods.\nXRP/USD 4H chart\nRipple is touching the support at $0.58, just above the lows from last May 23rd at $0.5749. This is a complex area, with heavy-inclined triangle formation containing the XRP/USD right now. There are supports at $0.57, $0.55 and $0.50 as the main targets for bears.\nOn the upside, XRP/USD has several barriers containing the bulls. The first target is at $0.59, followed by $0.61, $0.63 and strong resistances at $0.66 and $0.70.\nMACD in the Ripple 4-hour chart shows a very flat profile that might react to the upside before Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is showing the sellers losing some strength and already clearly below the ADX. Here the patterns are more developed than in Bitcoin's charts. Buyers have already reacted to these price levels.

Now, according to numerous regional reports, the Zimbabwe High Court has ruled in favor of the trading platform’s argument because the RBZ failed to show up to the trial.\nAlso read : I ndia’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now Harare High Court Reverses RBZ Cryptocurrency Ban\nMultiple regional news outlets and individuals on social media have reported that the Zimbabwe High Court has lifted the RBZ ban against cryptocurrency activities taking place within the country. The local digital asset exchange Golix decided to take the case to the High Court stating the RBZ had no right to enforce such laws and only the country’s parliament can issue a financial ban.\nAfter the bank issued its Circular to Banking Institutions No. 2/2018: Virtual Currencies , many people thought the central bank effectively banned all cryptocurrency activities. Today, Golix and its legal team managed to get High Court judge Justice Alphas Chitakunye to overturn the ban.\nOn May 24 one of the legal team members, and a constitutional lawyer, Fadzayi Mahere , announced the victory to her Twitter followers stating :\nRBZ ban on cryptos lifted by the High Court. Administrative justice is alive and well in this jurisdiction. Section 68 of the Constitution is our best friend. The legal team fighting against the recent RBZ ruling in Zimbabwe. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Representatives Fail to Attend Harare High Court Trial\nAlongside Fadzayi Mahere, the Golix team was represented by another attorney named Hopewell Chitima. The legal team used Section 68 of the country’s constitution but no representatives from the RBZ showed up to the trial. Regional reports state that because of this action, the Harare High Court justice ruled in favor of the Golix team. High Court judge Alphas Chitakunye’s ruling states:\nThe ban issued by the Respondents [RBZ] through letter dated 15 May 2018 against Applicant directing it to cease operations, shut down its virtual currency exchange business and ordering the closure of its bank account with its banks is hereby reversed and set aside.\nAt the time of publication, there have been no statements made by the RBZ, the central bank’s registrar Norman Mataruke, or the RBZ governor, John Mangudya.\nWhat do you think about the High Court lifting the RBZ ban? Do you think the central bank will respond to this ruling?

Wall Street’s biggest Bitcoin bull praised the move as the start of needed regulatory oversight.\nRead more: Bitcoin Manipulation Said to Be Focus of U.S. Criminal Probe\n“Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital LP, said in a telephone interview. “Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins,” he said, citing his own experience trying to trade.\n“We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors,” Winklevoss, president of the Gemini exchange, said in an emailed statement.\n“This is really welcome news ultimately because this means there is adult supervision coming/here,” Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in an email.\nThe world’s most valuable digital coin was down less than 1 percent as of 12 p.m. in New York, well off its lows for the day.\nBloomberg News first reported earlier Thursday that the DOJ opened a criminal probe into potential manipulation of the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, citing four people familiar with the matter. The investigation could shed light on whether reported trading volumes across exchanges are accurate, on whether traders use illegal practices to move prices in their favor and on other market irregularities.\nBitcoin fell as much as 4.3 percent to $7,267 after the news was published. The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure all year as regulators clamped down on the sector, in part because of the concerns raised in the DOJ investigation.\nSpencer Bogart of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital said he wouldn’t be surprised if regulators found cases of fraud, given even the most highly scrutinized markets haven’t been immune to it.\n“I don’t have any first-hand evidence of manipulation of Bitcoin prices but given that even the most highly regulated and most liquid markets in the world (e.g. Libor, FX markets, commodities) have consistently proven to be manipulated, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise,” Bogart said in an email.\nSome market participants have already alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Earlier this year trader Sylvain Ribes wrote a post on Medium where he said he believes more than $3 billion of all cryptoassets’ volume is fabricated, after analyzing exchanges’ order books. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders who have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nTrading volume for the total cryptocurrency market was at around $20 billion today, with Bitcoin accounting for about 30 percent of that, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThemis Trading LLC partner and co-head of equity trading Joseph Saluzzi said there should be cross-market surveillance in crypto markets to stop these practices.\n“The issue is that there is no one regulator monitoring the underlying exchanges and therefore there is no way to know if manipulation like spoofing is going on,” Saluzzi said in an email. “Some exchanges will say that they have information sharing agreements with each other, but again this is not enough to ensure that manipulation is not occurring. As we have seen in the equity market, exchanges are for-profit and can not be trusted to police themselves.”\n--With assistance from Lily Katz and Olga Kharif.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Camila Russo in New York at crusso15@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "focus of u.s. criminal probe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital lp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:13:30.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f72fc8261a94eb300656ebc1e49cc173e0c43217", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTN68u9e8ebZ9ROZxMz006Io0swAxGGR40hkBOPXeNCHjb1j1hp26SjGKu.CuRnnJvIkdSRsuOopw--", "site_full": "www.flickr.com", "site": "flickr.com", "site_section": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/cryptonews", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "cryptonews photos on Flickr | Flickr", "title": "Bitcoin Use Case: Limiting Government …", "title_full": "Crypto News Daily - Bitcoin Use Case: Limiting Government … | Flickr", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/961/28453309408_b1cfd9d29a_b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 176, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f72fc8261a94eb300656ebc1e49cc173e0c43217", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTN68u9e8ebZ9ROZxMz006Io0swAxGGR40hkBOPXeNCHjb1j1hp26SjGKu.CuRnnJvIkdSRsuOopw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "flickr.com", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Use Case: Limiting Government …", "text": "Bitcoin Use Case: Limiting Government Growth The Institute for Justice (IJ) bills itself as the national law firm for liberty.

Through a strategic partnership with Bitex, a cryptocurrency payment service provider based in South America, Dakak explained that the bank will outsource the conversion process of bitcoin to fiat currencies to Bitex, which will then send bitcoin to the recipient. The end cost would be the bitcoin transaction fee that is sent to the miners that verify transactions on the blockchain and the fee charged by Bitex.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” said Banco Masventas.\nDakak noted that one of the initial actions the bank took to streamline the implementation process of bitcoin was to cooperate with the Bitex development team to ensure recipients of bitcoin payments can seamlessly receive cryptocurrency transactions without boundaries. Dakak stated:\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.”\nThe SWIFT network, which is utilized by the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions, is essentially a messaging network that enables banks to share information. Sending a payment from one bank to another requires a message to be sent on the SWIFT network, which has to be verified manually.\nSending international payments and remittance transactions on the SWIFT network can take at least five business days to three weeks, depending on the size of the payment. Because most international payments processed by banks are large, it often takes more than a week for the payment to be cleared.\nSource: Shutterstock Bitcoin is not the most flexible blockchain network and it does not have the biggest capacity. But, it is the most robust blockchain protocol with the longest track record, equipped with one of the most active open-source development groups in the industry. Its transparency and security allow the Bitcoin network to operate as a reliable financial network for international payments.\nMoreover, most international payments sent by banks, as stated above, are often large transactions that cannot be processed by remittance outlets. Although bitcoin transaction fees could be an issue for $1 to $10 payments, for payments above $1,000, the bitcoin transaction fee is a non-issue.\nWhy is SWIFT Still Used? The SWIFT network is not only operated by leading banks by owned by the world’s biggest financial institutions. As such, even though the SWIFT network is outdated and utilizes an inferior technology, banks have the obligation to use it. That is, until minor banks like Bank Masventas opt out of the SWIFT network and begin to leverage public financial networks like bitcoin, which are completely decentralized and peer-to-peer.\nOther banks have started to pilot blockchain protocols like Ripple and Ethereum to process international payments, which could be crucial in demonstrating the potential of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the global finance sector in the long-term.\nImages from Shuttertsock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toshi times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:59:58.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e5d0dfddc399d1816cd6c2fc1fb2763be3f562a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiTWEjR4Lfs0SkoCc.qz4tU3rf6X2pNOAQeZ0QPUX8R6EnyYUU97Z8EvwmKixMoBiRq0M4t2hMBJnSn2TgSLRWlZjkbRI2nn59ovZRXx2CjjRTCMS05yfg.fsh9W6Ntvwyrfzq8FxYhejCaB8XLWMKmI-", "site_full": "www.freedomsphoenix.com", "site": "freedomsphoenix.com", "site_section": "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/RSS/RSS-Feed.xml?EdNo=001&Page=Art", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Freedom's Phoenix Top Stories", "title": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax", "title_full": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax", "published": "2018-05-24T02:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Uploads/Graphics/533-0523165529-725Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9jYjg3MTk3NjQ1NGEzMjdkNzZhZWZjOWFiNmI1NDkxMS5qcGc--1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e5d0dfddc399d1816cd6c2fc1fb2763be3f562a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiTWEjR4Lfs0SkoCc.qz4tU3rf6X2pNOAQeZ0QPUX8R6EnyYUU97Z8EvwmKixMoBiRq0M4t2hMBJnSn2TgSLRWlZjkbRI2nn59ovZRXx2CjjRTCMS05yfg.fsh9W6Ntvwyrfzq8FxYhejCaB8XLWMKmI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T02:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax", "text": "It's a sea of red across cryptos...\nSo much for Blockchain Week...\nAnd the entire cryptospace is accelerating lower...\nWhile it is never clear what the driver of price action is, news from China and India appear to major potential catalysts in the last 24-48 hours...\nCoinTelegraph reports that India is working on proposals to make cryptocurrency transactions subject to goods and services tax (GST), sources told Bloomberg May 23.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-considers-taxing-cryptocurrency-at-18-as-intangible-property-reports", "https://www.bloombergquint.com/gst/2018/05/23/india-mulls-gst-on-trading-of-virtual-currencies#gs.p1EJ508", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/india"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china crackdown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:13:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c2be067faa1e4432effe530426560c0a17c5c75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQmSpTUmb8jGS4MUqV40O6UaN6aNi0z_x74qXn5daP7hGVYuB_EHrAqccFaZ9s_QAP9RGv36LdSvEv0CdCJ..Z_cN0cP_tXfB_", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Will Bitcoin break 20k soon !

The result is an incredibly misleading ad that says Bitcoin fans are for drug deals and human trafficking.\nFellow Democrats Dave Min and Brian Forde clashed over accepting cryptocurrencies as donations while running for California's 45 th Congressional race.\nForde is promoted by the media as amongst the earliest politicians to start accepting cryptocurrencies as donations. With that said, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, have made their way into mainstream politics over the last couple of years. Back in September 2017, Austin Petersen, a Senate candidate in Missouri also began accepting Bitcoin for campaign contributions.\nCryptocurrency and politics is a relatively new phenomenon. Winston Edmonson, a four-time mayoral candidate in the Texas city of Lewisville, proposed the issuance of a municipal cryptocurrency as means of funding the local police force without having to raise taxes. Then there was firebrand Ron Paul putting forward a bill to allow competing currencies.\nDemocratic Deer Fight As reported by multiple outlets, Brian Forde has stated that his campaign has managed to raise upwards of $130,000 in different cryptocurrencies. This clearly shows that Forde is currently a favorite among the world of crypto enthusiasts. Another proof for that is that he's managed to get more Bitcoin contributions than all of the previous candidates for Congress combined, according to Bloomberg.\nNaturally, this fires up the spark of competition. A rival Democratic candidate of Forde – Dave Min, who's also a former SEC attorney, launched a TV ad which contained the following line about his rival:\nBrian Forde's big donors? Bitcoin speculators who oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.\nNow that's harsh.\nPressing Where It Hurts Naturally, a strong statement of the kind is to be expected to trigger a serious reaction. As such, one would expect for it to be substantiated with facts, as politics is all about hard facts and decisions based on them, right? Don't answer that.\nAccording to Axios , Min's campaign manager failed to provide any reasonable merit for these serious accusations. As a matter of fact, as if she's realized that the ad might have gone a bit too far, she states that while Min \"is a huge believer in the potential of distributed ledger technology,\" his primary concerns are focused towards some \"deregulatory agenda being pushed by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\"\nQuestionable Merits at Best Despite refusing to provide any straightforward specifics, Min's campaign manager pointed towards Brock Pierce as one of Forde's leading Bitcoin donors. To this, Forde responded that:\nPierce, while extremely controversial, has never publicly said he opposes 'cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.'\nIndeed, starting beef of that kind seems quite sensational, but it should at least be backed by certain spot-on facts so that it doesn't deflate as soon as someone questions it.\nCan we Please Cut the Cr*p Already? For whatever reason, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, are continuously being associated with all kinds of illicit activity. Yes, Bitcoin is used by criminals, and so are other digital currencies. But it doesn't even begin to compare to conventional fiat currency in this respect.\nAnd that's a stone cold, research-backed truth. So much so, in fact, that it has been confirmed by official authorities and institutions throughout the entire world. The UK's National Crime Agency confirmed it, Quebec's government confirmed it, and even Hong Kong's Financial Services and Treasury confirmed it, to list a few.\nIn other words, it might be high time for officials, especially those who are in or currently running for office, regardless of where they are, to do a flat-out fact check before refuting an entire community based on, well, nothing.\nDo you agree with Dave Min's position on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' usage for human trafficking and drug deals?

an old saying on Wall Street that when times are good, you should focus on the return on your capital, but when times are bad, you should only care about the return of your capital. A flight to quality asset then is anything that tends to go up in times of turmoil because investors perceive it as a safe place to park their money.\nUpon first glance, Bitcoin is a terrible candidate for such a role. It’s volatile, hard to understand, and difficult to access given how it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nSo why would anyone consider it desirable during a crisis? Because it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nOne of the first parabolic up-moves for the cryptocoin began with a banking crisis in Cypress. Back in 2013, while still reeling from the aftermath of the financial crisis, the tiny Mediterranean country found its banking system teetering , and reached out to the bigger European powers for help.\nBut instead of offering them a bailout, the EU came back with something more along the lines of a bail- in, as it demanded that Cypriot banks confiscate a portion of their customers deposits to shore up their balance sheets. To add insult to injury, they also imposed capital controls that prevented people from moving their money to a safer jurisdiction.\nAs you can see on the chart below, a decentralized form of money like Bitcoin, despite its drawbacks, can suddenly look very appealing when the centralized system starts to falter.\nCrypto skeptics who tell us that digital money should not be worth anything often forget that fiat money like the Euro is also in of itself worthless. It’s only valuable when someone else is willing to trade a good or service for it. But you can’t get anything in exchange for money that the government is taking or locking up, which is why the Cypriot crisis brought a lot of attention to the then relatively unknown Bitcoin.\nGovernment officials don’t like cryptocoins because they transfer the sovereignty of money from their control to a decentralized consensus mechanism, a transfer that they view as a downgrade in the quality of money. If our existing system of money and banking was always stable, they would have a point.\nBut every time there is a crisis , it reminds the public that the folks in charge are not as smart as they think they are. When those same leaders respond to the crisis with draconian capital controls (or selective bailouts for their once and future employers on Wall Street) they remind the public that they aren’t as fair as they think they are, either. Bitcoin might be volatile and hard to understand, but it’s always fair, because math does not discriminate, nor does it change the rules when people start to panic.\nSo why bring this issue up now? Because there is financial trouble brewing in certain corners of the global financial system, and if things continue to deteriorate, this year might serve as an important test of the crypto economy.\nIran and Venezuela are in the midst of the kinds of hyperinflationary currency death spirals that bring societies to their knees. In Argentina, the peso has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar as inflation and interest rates spike. Turkey is having problems of its own , and China continues to do everything it can to prevent its citizens from liberating their own money.\nSome of this weakness was to be expected, because the Federal Reserve is now removing the liquidity it has provided for the past decade. But there’s a bigger issue in play, as the perennial economic mismanagement of developing nations is now rubbing up against the increasing political instability ( Brexit, Trump, Catalonia, Five Star ) of developed ones.\nIn the old days, the two best candidates for flight to quality assets were gold and the Dollar. But the former is hard to get a hold of and even harder to store, and the latter is no panacea either. When the Argentinian government last devalued its currency back in 2001, it first forced all local banks to convert the dollar-denominated accounts of its citizens to the Peso. Even the citizens that were smart enough not to trust the local currency had their savings destroyed, learning the valuable lesson that dollars in the bank is not the same as dollars under the mattress.\nOne of the most important takeaways from past financial crisis is that when the stuff hits the fan, banks are nothing more than a policy tool for the government.\nSo can a cryptocoin like Bitcoin be considered a flight to quality asset for certain countries? Given everything we’ve learned in the past 20 years, a better question to ask might be how could it not.\n* * *\nOmid Malekan is the author of the newly published The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner’s Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands.

Lee identifies three key factors that make him believe that the price will exceed the 2017 maximum. On Wednesday, the BTC fell below $ 8,000 and traded around $ 7,500, losing most of the gains it made from mid-April through early May. With the fall on Wednesday, BTC has dropped 41 percent this year. Lee estimates that this decline is due solely to \"typical cryptographic volatility,\" and explains his bullish stance with three main factors. The first key factor is the production of BTC and the costs of replication. On Tuesday, on CNBC's \"Futures Now\", Lee said BTC \"quoted at cost\" because the production price was almost equal to the trading price. Since, according to Lee, the production cost of BTC production was approximately $ 6,000 on Wednesday, it is still worth more than its cost of extraction. Among the key factors that could trigger a potential price increase, Lee names institutional investors who, although interested in the cryptographic space, have not fully entered the industry due to regulatory uncertainties. I think institutional investors have a lot of interest. I do not really get into crypto again because there is still regulatory uncertainty. But this kind of final assignment in Crypto as a class of assets is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin is mobilizing.\n Historically, 10 days includes all the performance of a given year of the Bitcoin price. If you leave these 10 days, Bitcoin has dropped 25 percent a year. As miserable as keeping Bitcoin at $ 8,000, the pass from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000 will be made in a matter of days. Earlier this month, Fundstrat Global Advisors revealed that the research puts the price of BTC at $ 36,000 in 2019 based on historical averages. The analysis of the relationship between mining costs of BTC and price analysts has led to the prediction of the range of cryptocurrencies between $ 20,000 and $ 64,000 at the end of 2019. At the moment press, BTC is quoted at $ 7,594.

"\nAt the time of the press, the nine major digital currencies are in the red, with a market capitalization of less than 330 billion dollars, compared with 390 billion dollars a few days ago.\nThe links are generally volatile and can lead to unexplained meetings and retreats. It seems that there is no specific reason that led to this fall; and in general, the fundamental news is positive and encouraging.\nArgentine bank Banco Masventas (BMV) has linked with Bitex to facilitate the use of Bitcoin for international payments. It is planned to reduce the transfer time by one day. A similar Ripple pilot project using the xRapid platform had announced a payment term of only 2 minutes and transaction savings of 40 to 70 percent.\nSeveral sectors are exploring ways to implement blockchain technology to improve productivity and responsibility. In the same way, governments are also exploring ways to implement the blockchain, while many central banks are playing with the idea of their own cryptocurrency.\nWith so many things, declines should be seen as a buying opportunity, but traders must wait until the end of the downside before taking long positions.\nBTC / USD\nWe recommend buying Bitcoin closer to the support of $ 7,941.68 if it remained, but today it has collapsed below $ 7,700, which shows strong selling pressure. There are two possibilities at this level.\nThe first is that the bulls will return above the $ 7,900 level after a short break, taking the bears by surprise. Another possibility is that the price distribution of $ 7,900 and the slip to $ 7,000. It is difficult to predict which of the two scenarios will be developed.\n The best approach is to wait and observe for a few days. If the BTC / USD pair breaks and you have less than $ 7,900, you should not buy.\nIf prices temporarily fall below $ 7,900 but recover and stay above $ 8,000, traders can buy approximately 50% of their usual position and maintain an adjusted stop, preferably lower than recent lows. The remaining 50% position can be added once the digital currency exceeds both moving averages.\nThe goal is to return to levels of $ 10,000. It is a risky business, but one that can be taken because of the attractive risk / reward ratio.\nETH / USD\nEthereum broke under the neck of the head and shoulders on May 22. Today, it has extended the decline, crossing the 50-day mark of SMA and the 50% retracement of Fibonacci's last rally. There is a smaller support at $ 544.45, at 61.8 percent of the Fibonacci retracement level, below which a fall of $ 418 is likely. The ETH / USD will only become positive above the $ 745 levels. We suggest waiting until the denial ends before attempting a purchase.\nIt is not advisable to catch a falling knife.\nXRP / USD\nThe ripple is fast approaching the bottom of the beach. Although this support of $ 0.56270 was distributed at the end of March this year, it did not find sellers at lower levels, and prices went back to the range on April 12th. We believe that the bulls will try to defend the levels of $ 0.56. If the minimums continue, operators can expect the XRP / USD to increase to $ 0.93 then $ 1.22 in the medium term.\nWe suggest that you wait a few days to confirm that the decline has ended before buying, since a fall below $ 0.56 may extend the decrease to $ 0.45, below which the digital currency may fall to 0, $ 24.\nBCH / USD\nBitcoin Cash broke under the neck and shoulders on May 16, and the new distribution test was held on May 20 and May 21. The BCH / USD pair broke under the 50-day SMA on May 22. Now it should go down to $ 650 with support less than $ 750.\nThe level of $ 558.3870 has not been broken since November of last year. As a result, merchants can buy once the digital currency stabilizes near key support levels.\nEOS / USD\nEOS did not manage to leave the descending channel on May 21 and rejected from there. It approved the 50-day SMA mark on May 22 and followed it with a break from the May 16 low of $ 11.8210 today. There is support less than $ 10 or less, in the 78.6% retracement levels of $ 9.6136. If these two levels break, the EOS / USD pair may fall to the lower trend line of the $ 8 chain.\nWith the fall in prices of moving prices and Fibonacci retracement levels of 61.8 percent of the latest rebound, the virtual currency has turned negative.\nWe will change our point of view once the price comes out of the downline and will stay above it.\nLTC / USD\nLitecoin broke below the immediate support of $ 127,108. The next support to the downside is $ 115 and lower than the $ 107,102, which is the lowest intraday on February 2 of this year.\n We expect strong support in the range of $ 107 to $ 115, because if the minimum of $ 107 is broken, we will have to complete a bearish bearish pattern that will be very negative for the LTC / USD pair.\nIf the support zone is maintained, we should see another attempt to get out of the bearish trend line of the triangle. We suggest that you wait for the digital currency to accept the levels mentioned above before starting long positions.\nADA / USD\nCardano broke below the $ 0.23 levels, which had been acting as a strong support in recent days. Now it can go down to $ 0.13 with support less than $ 0.19. Repeated attempts to break the $ 0.13 mark in March and April of this year have failed. Therefore, we see this as strong support again this time around.\nHowever, we suggest that you wait a few days before setting long positions because if the ADA / USD goes from $ 0.13, it could fall to $ 0.08, a level last seen in December 2017 .\nXLM / USD\nStellar broke under the neck of the head and shoulders, which is a bearish sign. Although the model's targets are much lower, it is now expected to decrease to the high support level of $ 0.184. This level has been maintained for about a month from mid-March to mid-April this year, so we can expect some purchases to reach $ 0.184. If the bulls manage to defend the support, the pair XLM / USD will also confirm the formation of a range, which can be exchanged by buying with a low rebound and selling near the range of air resistance.\nOperators can wait for prices to stabilize and turn around before buying.\nTRX / USD\nTRX has been inactive for two days and has surpassed the EMA mark of 20 days. He is currently trying to support the trend line. If it breaks, it can fall to the 50-day SMA.\n The TRX / USD has not crossed the levels of $ 0.059 since April 25. Therefore, a fall of $ 0.06 should attract the purchase.\nOperators must wait one or two days to confirm that levels are maintained, and then buy a rebound of $ 0.059. If the digital currency runs below $ 0.056, long positions should be avoided because they open the door to a new fall at $ 0.04.\nThe digital currency is the strongest among the most important ones we cover, since it is the only one that is being negotiated near its 20-day EMA and well above its 50-day SMA.

Bank Moves from SWIFT to Bitcoin\nBMV said in a statement :\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries. The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.”\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company’s operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX. In Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o\n— Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018\nRipple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks. Should Bitcoin Be Used by Banks?\nMany token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin’s genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer. Instead of going through a bank, users could set up their own wallets and send transactions without using a bank, but novices may find this risky as mistakes can happen.\n* * *\nThe question is – will this enable BMV customers to get around any future capital controls enforced by the government should this currency collapse turn even more crisis-er?

These are forms of market manipulation designed to influence the price of assets. They are illegal in mainstream financial markets. A BI investigation last year found “pump and dump” scams – where groups falsely ramp up the price of assets for profit – are rife in cryptocurrency markets.\nLONDON – The US Justice Department has reportedly opened a criminal probe into potential market manipulation of bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report.\nBloomberg reported that the Justice Department is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential market manipulation.\nThe investigation is said to focus on “spoofing”– where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn to manipulate prices – in an attempt to lure other people into buying or selling and “wash trading,” where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of market activity.\nThese kinds of activities allow bad actors to manipulate the price of assets in their favour. Spoofing and wash trading are illegal in mainstream regulated markets such as equities and futures.\nA Business Insider investigation last year found so-called “pump and dump” scams are rife in cryptocurrency markets. This is where people “pump” a price of a certain crypto by bidding up the price before “dumping” it on unsuspecting traders who are lured into the market by the pumpers who say the price is only going up.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently cited Business Insider’s investigation in a report highlighting concerns about cryptocurrency markets.\nAnonymous Twitter account Bitfinex’ed, which has over 38,000 followers, has also repeatedly drawn attention to alleged instances of wash trading and spoofing, calling for action from regulators.\nBloomberg reports that the US regulators’ investigation, which is in its early stages, focuses on bitcoin, ether, and other major cryptocurrencies.\nBusiness Insider interviewed an alleged “pump and dump” ringleader last year who claimed to have been involved in bitcoin price manipulation in the past but said the size of the market made it too hard to manipulate today.\n“We did manipulate these but now it’s too hard with big market capitalisation,” the trader, who went by the name Nico, claimed. “Our biggest power ever has been around $US5 million… [for] one of the groups.” NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videos Want to read a more in-depth view on the trends influencing Australian business and the global economy?

Can Bitcoin Replace SWIFT?\nThrough a strategic partnership with Bitex, a cryptocurrency payment service provider based in South America, Dakak explained that the bank will outsource the conversion process of bitcoin to fiat currencies to Bitex, which will then send bitcoin to the recipient. The end cost would be the bitcoin transaction fee that is sent to the miners that verify transactions on the blockchain and the fee charged by Bitex.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” said Banco Masventas.\nDakak noted that one of the initial actions the bank took to streamline the implementation process of bitcoin was to cooperate with the Bitex development team to ensure recipients of bitcoin payments can seamlessly receive cryptocurrency transactions without boundaries. Dakak stated:\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.”\nThe SWIFT network , which is utilized by the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions, is essentially a messaging network that enables banks to share information. Sending a payment from one bank to another requires a message to be sent on the SWIFT network, which has to be verified manually.\nSending international payments and remittance transactions on the SWIFT network can take at least five business days to three weeks, depending on the size of the payment. Because most international payments processed by banks are large, it often takes more than a week for the payment to be cleared. Source: Shutterstock\nBitcoin is not the most flexible blockchain network and it does not have the biggest capacity. But, it is the most robust blockchain protocol with the longest track record, equipped with one of the most active open-source development groups in the industry. Its transparency and security allow the Bitcoin network to operate as a reliable financial network for international payments.\nMoreover, most international payments sent by banks, as stated above, are often large transactions that cannot be processed by remittance outlets. Although bitcoin transaction fees could be an issue for $1 to $10 payments, for payments above $1,000, the bitcoin transaction fee is a non-issue. Why is SWIFT Still Used?\nThe SWIFT network is not only operated by leading banks by owned by the world’s biggest financial institutions. As such, even though the SWIFT network is outdated and utilizes an inferior technology, banks have the obligation to use it. That is, until minor banks like Bank Masventas opt out of the SWIFT network and begin to leverage public financial networks like bitcoin, which are completely decentralized and peer-to-peer.\nOther banks have started to pilot blockchain protocols like Ripple and Ethereum to process international payments, which could be crucial in demonstrating the potential of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the global finance sector in the long-term.\nImages from Shuttertsock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency argentinian bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:08:54.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f59d6b4fd7202b23271d4aa0542906cd3a4324b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCo91dlhJvFHuhLxSwQa9Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "if bitcoin becomes the country's currency", "title_full": "if bitcoin becomes the country's currency", "published": "2018-05-24T02:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f59d6b4fd7202b23271d4aa0542906cd3a4324b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCo91dlhJvFHuhLxSwQa9Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cryptocb", "published": "2018-05-24T02:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "if bitcoin becomes the country's currency", "text": "Any country that used bitcoin as they currency, is going to be a good one, because them need to build a strong network and make a simple device available to enable make transaction easier and faster.

Some people certainly think that is the case, whereas others are not necessarily on the same page. Brian Kelly is very bullish on this altcoin right now, but only time will tell if his sentiment is the right one. Brian Kelly is Bullish on BCH Over the past few years, we have seen some interesting opinions on various cryptocurrencies. A lot of people think Bitcoin is the only currency that matters, although certain altcoins should not be overlooked. Bitcoin Cash, for example, is making a big impact, even though the opinions on this altcoin are still pretty contentious. Brian Kelly, a notorious cryptocurrency investor and speculator, is confident that Bitcoin Cash is going places. More specifically, he considers Bitcoin Cash to be the “must-own” cryptocurrency of the moment, although it is evident that not everyone will see it that way. There are some interesting reasons as to why Kelly is thinking along these lines right now. In his opinion, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and ecosystem are gaining value pretty quickly. With mining pools now contributing some of their rewards to support the future development of BCH, a lot of interesting things can happen in the future. This development comes on the heels of news that Bitmain is destroying some of the fees it receives by moving BCH to an unspendable address. Additionally, one has to keep in mind that the Bitcoin Cash price hasn’t seen any major setbacks since its launch last year. Although it has spiked to a value which is a lot higher than the current price, one BCH is still valued at $1,225 right now. Given the issues which all cryptocurrency markets have encountered during the first few months of 2018, the Bitcoin Cash price has held its own quite well, all things considered. Whether or not the opinion of Brian Kelly will convince more people to invest in BCH remains to be determined. It is evident there is a lot of speculation associated with cryptocurrencies right now, and everything can seem like a good and bad investment at the same time. The markets will have to turn around at some point, but until that happens, the Bitcoin Cash price may not go much higher than it is right now. It is good to see enthusiasts and investors turn bullish on cryptocurrencies once again.

For this demo, researchers Tadge Dryja and Alin S. Dragos built a test oracle to broadcast the recent price of U.S. dollars in satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoins, which anyone can grab and use for their smart contracts.\nIt’s a notable step forward for the idea, one first proposed by lightning inventor Dryja last summer. However, this is the first time it’s been implemented as a prototype with working code.\nDragos told CoinDesk:\n“We built this as a standalone feature of our lightning network software. We chose data what we thought would be cool, U.S. dollars, but it could be any data you want, whether weather or a stock.”\nDragos stressed that the demo is “experimental” and “shouldn’t be used for real money.” That said, he and other MIT researchers are convinced that with the help of the lightning network, bitcoin might one day scale to capacities originally envisioned by its early users.\nAs part of that work, MIT researchers have already created an implementation for the lightning network called lit, and this oracle code is an add-on of that work.\n“We at DCI, we really believe in the lightning network,” Dragos said. “Bitcoin doesn’t scale very well. I decided there has to be something better. Turns out what’s better is lightning. It’s the way to scale.” Bitcoin smart contracts\nBut while lightning provides scale, smart contracts add other new functionality to bitcoin. For example, should the tech in MIT’s test be implemented, you could make some sort of a bet based on what’s happening in the world.\nOr, in this case, a futures contract. Alice promises to pay Bob whatever the price of dollars is in satoshis on a certain day, say Friday. If a dollar is worth 12,150 satoshis by the end of the week, then she will end up paying that.\nIt’s a kind of advanced smart contract use case that is usually not associated with bitcoin.\n“When folks think smart contracts, they think ethereum. Their scripting language is much richer,” Dragos admitted.\nBut, he argues that with some workarounds, bitcoin can do the same thing.\n“It’s not as developer friendly because bitcoin didn’t go in that direction, but you can use it. You have to be a little creative,” Dragos said.\nIn short, it uses Dryja’s “discreet log contracts” scheme to broadcast data to the smart contracts. One of the most important advantages of this scheme is scalability, because most of the data doesn’t need to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe other is privacy, since oracles don’t have any way of knowing who’s using the data they’re broadcasting.\n“We’re introducing a model where oracles are not aware of who’s using the data they’re using,” Dragos said. Some ‘quandaries’\nBut while this simple demo is now complete, Dragos and Dryja think there are many outstanding questions and “quandaries,” as Dragos put it. “From the individual oracle’s perspective, they’re going to want to make some money. We’re going to have to understand that,” Dragos said.\nAnother is that the oracle at this point is trusted. But there might be a way to minimize this trust by allowing a user to use many oracles at once.\nBut there’s a certain point where MIT DCI hopes to stop working on the technology and pass it off to someone else.\n“We’re working with companies that might implement this,” Dragos said. And though he couldn’t name names, he mentioned they are “big company” partners of the DCI.\nThe hope is these bigger companies will be better at understanding what normal users want from the software. So, while MIT DCI built a prototype demonstrating how the underlying technology really works, they haven’t produced an app as mindlessly easy to use as say, Venmo or Facebook.\n“UX is not our core expertise,” Dragos said.\nNow it’s open for people to use for whatever oracle data they want. So, it’s up to the community to decide if it’s worthwhile to use or not.\n“It’s a hard guess. It could be a significant deal if people use it. But we don’t know what people are going to be using it for,” he added.\nDragos stated:\n“New technologies are available all the time, that doesn’t mean they end up making it though.”\nLightning image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He touched on their complexity and the fact that they are connected with a yearning for social revolution. Robert Shiller is an esteemed Nobel prize winning economist who is known for his warnings about the dot-com and the housing bubbles. In an interview for CNBC, the professor at Yale University expressed his rather negative sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying: To me it’s another example of faddish human behavior. Shiller’s opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also consolidated in a blog post that he published on May 21 st . Apples and Oranges Shiller lays down his take on cryptocurrencies, bringing forward what he believes are comparable examples of other failed attempts to replace conventional fiat currency. He touches the so-called Labor Theory of Value , as well as John Pease Norton’s proposition of introducing a dollar, the value of which was backed by electricity. Both of those examples attempted to replace the gold standard, which, for the US, meant that 40% of its notes had to be backed by gold. This ended in 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard, severing the connection between gold and the dollar. As it is painfully obvious, both those examples proposed new models during an existing, pre-determined standard. They attempted to disrupt what was currently existing and replace it with something new – money backed by labor and electricity, respectively, and not by gold, which was the merit at the time these propositions came to light. As Shiller notes: Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story, […] But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does nothing of the kind. It’s not backed by any actual asset like gold, silver, or time. All Aboard the Bitcoin Revolution! Apparently, Shiller thinks Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were introduced by some sort of anti-governmental villains, a community of aspiring entrepreneurs who “hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.” Let’s break that down. Bitcoin was introduced by an anonymous person or a group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Up until this moment, Bitcoin’s founder(s) remain anonymous, so it’s hard to say that they are holding themselves above any government. Another leading project in the field is Ethereum, the founder of which is well-known – Vitalik Buterin . While he’s particularly active on social media, never has he touched that digital currencies are to overthrow any government, let alone to cause some sort of social revolution. Ambiguity Levels Over 9000! As it is with quite a lot of people who stand to refute the merits of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Shiller also goes on to say that he doesn’t mean to “dismiss it.” He also lightly touched on the fact that “some smart people got into this (Bitcoin) and some other cryptocurrencies.” So which is it? As a matter of fact, whole countries are jumping on the cryptocurrency wagon, assembling teams to create their own virtual currencies – China and Iran are prime examples. Major companies from different sectors are launching their own blockchain-based projects. Cases in point: JP Morgan , Facebook , LG , Microsoft , Oracle , HTC , and many more. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US launched a mock crypto project to help spread awareness and to advocate caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, essentially recognizing that they are here to stay. Yet, Shiller’s merits lie within what seems to be a rather old sentiment: Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, […] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough. It’s probably safe to say that there is something a lot more measurable than “mystery” and “revolutionary zeal” when countries are assembling task forces and working hard towards regulating a field. If anything, it speaks that institutions have recognized what this new field has to offer and that they are attempting to work out a way to incorporate it into our everyday lives.

The currency is now trading for just over $7,600 – the lowest it’s been in about 35 days. This marks a serious drop over the last two weeks. Just two weekends ago, the currency was trading for about $9,800 – the highest it had been in four weeks. As bitcoin was expected to spike to $10,000, many traders and investors alike sat with bated breath, hoping the currency would once again strike five figures and prove to the world it was not a fluke, and that its behavior during December of last year wasn’t just some random occurrence. Sadly, bitcoin appears unable to show off for the time being. The currency has incurred serious drops ever since that weekend high, and even failed to garner major price boosts during last week’s Coindesk Consensus Conference, which even analyst Tom Lee of Fundstrat was surprised by. In the past, bitcoin has always rallied during these Conferences, so to witness the exact opposite behavior this year is not only frustrated and upsetting – it’s also concerning. Why is bitcoin dropping to such a degree? Up to this point, the cryptocurrency has experienced falls of anywhere between $100 and $300 on a somewhat daily basis, all the while gaining a little traction here and there to slightly remedy the negative consequences. What could stir such a nasty, sudden and above all, large drop in such a short period? At press time, most analysts appear to be of the sentiment that bitcoin is not only trapped in a bearish trend, but that it may last for some time. One source, for example, says that another sell-off is occurring – one comparable in size to the sell-off that occurred at the end of 2017. Indeed, bitcoin’s recent drop is a huge indicator that this practice has not yet passed on. Unfortunately, this same source suggests that bitcoin’s next support level sits at $7,200 – roughly $400 less than its current mark. From there, bitcoin could drop down to where it stood in March. The bearish trend we’re currently witnessing may not end until the currency falls to $6,000. Another analyst is on the opposite side of the spectrum, and suggests that bitcoin support sits at $7,800. Thus, we could witness small price spikes in the coming days before any serious changes occur. He further states that bullish momentum is forming, and that bitcoin could potentially retrace its steps back to the $8,000 range. In the meantime, some good things are still happening for the father of cryptocurrencies. Banco Masventas in Argentina, for example, has started a program that allows customers to make cross-border payments using bitcoin. The bank is looking to expand its services to as many as 50 separate countries. In addition, executives say that customers can look forward to the bank’s rapid transaction speeds of less than 24 hours. This is a major milestone for bitcoin, which is noted for its slow transaction periods of roughly one to three days on average. Banco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to handle international fund transfers using BTC as a base currency.

Bank Moves from SWIFT to Bitcoin\nBMV said in a statement :\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries. The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.”\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company’s operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX. In Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o — Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018\nRipple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks. Should Bitcoin Be Used by Banks?\nMany token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin’s genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer. Instead of going through a bank, users could set up their own wallets and send transactions without using a bank, but novices may find this risky as mistakes can happen.\n* * *\nThe question is - will this enable BMV customers to get around any future capital controls enforced by the government should this currency collapse turn even more crisis-er?

Exploiting ‘Invisible’ Features In a series of tweets on May 21st, Rosenfeld added to the “cargo cult” narrative which first appeared at the Consensus 2018 conference last week. Rosenfeld began: The reason ‘Blockchain’ is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works. 1/10 The reason \"Blockchain\" is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works. — Meni Rosenfeld (@MeniRosenfeld) May 21, 2018 Criticism of products and services claiming to use blockchain has returned to the cryptocurrency industry after Consensus gained criticism from some of Bitcoin’s best-known names. Stemming from a heated panel featuring a JPMorgan executive and Bitcoin educator Jimmy Song, Song led straight-talking appraisals of the executive’s newly-unveiled blockchain tool, telling the audience he had heard “nothing but buzzwords.” On social media thereafter, as Bitcoinist reported , Bitcoin core developer Johnathan Corgan called time on blockchain becoming a fresh example of “cargo cult engineering” – the belief innovation will generate prosperity by definition. Corgan warned: Unrestrained incantation of buzzwords and feel good hype does not a successful business plan make. Consumers Will Suffer Only When It’s Too Late Meni’s comments appear to incorporate not only dubious business proposals incorporating blockchain technology without use cases, but also spin-offs of Bitcoin itself, using its blockchain to create a new product, the downsides of which can only be understood with proper knowledge of “how, why, and when blockchains work.” While not naming specific examples, the allusion appears to be to the controversial Bitcoin Cash hard fork . Meni Rosenfeld continued: Even without using any of Bitcoin’s innovation, I can create a system that, to the end user, will appear indistinguishable from Bitcoin – greatly outperform it, in fact. It will allow receiving tokens and sending to anyone, easily and quickly, with little to no fees. Of course, it will be completely centralized, and with it will come the associated risks – The system might one day shut down, or start charging high fees or apply censorship. But these are things that might happen in *the future*. They’re not things you can observe now. Like Song, Rosenfeld also highlighted that a lack of consumer knowledge was driving the financial success of such projects. What do you think about Meni Rosenfeld’s take on Blockchain?

Located at Herman Vapes, an E-juice center, the accomplishment is looked forward to providing convenience to digital currency lovers and beginners in the field.\nBitcoin Dispenser for Liverpudlians Purchasing bitcoin may come off as a complicated task, but bitcoin ATMs makes the task easy even for the novice in the industry.\nAlphavend announced the milestone on May 21. The ATM is stationed at 15 Cases St, L1 1HW, and the users can use the machine between 10.00 am to 5.30 pm Monday to Saturday and 12.00 pm until 4.00pm on Sundays. Located in the heart of the city, Herman Vapes has a high footfall every day of the week.\nImage: Google Maps\nReferring to the installation, a spokesperson for Herman Vapes said :\n\"We are really excited to be the location chosen by Alphavend for the first ever bitcoin ATM in Liverpool, and we are sure it will attract plenty of interest.\"\nEarlier in 2018, former Liverpool F.C. striker Michael Owen revealed his partnership with Singapore-based blockchain startup Global Crypto Offering Exchange (GCOX) to issue a cryptocurrency, apparently named OWN coin. GCOX is known to facilitate celebrities to develop their own coins.\nUK Relatively Friendly to Crypto, But Taking Cautious Approach\nAs bitcoin is receiving overwhelming recognition, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has tried it's best to accommodate the advancement of digital currency while simultaneously setting safeguards for investors.\nMartin Walker, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Management, told the Express newspaper, there are \"very good public interest grounds for putting in place the most restrictive regulatory regime possible around cryptocurrencies, banning where necessary and possible,\" thus making it a questionable issue.\nAccording to Coin ATM Radar , there are 134 bitcoin/crypto ATMs in the United Kingdom, in the lead compared to many other European countries that are riding the crypto wave; only Austria has more ATMs totaling 165. Cryptocurrency ATMs are considered as an uncomplicated way of purchasing digital assets, with the UK is moving at a much faster pace toward the installation of bitcoin ATMs.\nDo crypto ATMs come handy?

Why are cryptocurrencies plunging?\nThere are a few possible negative catalysts. For example, some of the hype surrounding the well-publicized \"Blockchain Week\" in New York City may have bolstered prices, and now that it's over, we could be seeing lower investor interest. <>\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst driving down cryptocurrency prices is regulatory fears.\nFears of increased global regulation have been the culprit in several big cryptocurrency sell-offs this year. The South Korean cryptocurrency saga in particular caused quite a bit of volatility.\nThis time, it's closer to home. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating. <>\nTo be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge.\nThis comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued <> strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months.

And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the <> biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption -- volatility.\nIn the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.\nBitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you now Advisor, has tripled ten investing directly in Bitcoin was noticeably absent from their recommendations! better buys.\n<> Learn more\n{% render_component 'sa-returns-as-of' type='rg'%}\n<> Matt Frankel has no position in any cryptocurrencies mentioned.

Matthew Frankel, The Motley Fool Reblog Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and most other major cryptocurrencies are deep in the red on Wednesday -- the latest in a two-week decline. In fact, all of the 25 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (excluding Tether, which is based on the U.S. dollar) are down today. Here's a look at the latest cryptocurrency prices and what might be behind this massive drop. Gold coin with bitcoin symbols. More Image source: Getty Images. Today's cryptocurrency prices Here's a look at the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down by more than 7% over the last 24 hours, and is actually the best-performing of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies. Six of the top 10 are down by double digits, and only three of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are positive on Wednesday. In short, this is about as broad of a sell-off as you can get.\nCryptocurrency Name (Code)\n$1.48\n(14.5%) Data source: www.investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of May 23, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate. Why are cryptocurrencies plunging? There are a few possible negative catalysts. For example, some of the hype surrounding the well-publicized \"Blockchain Week\" in New York City may have bolstered prices, and now that it's over, we could be seeing lower investor interest. Perhaps the biggest catalyst driving down cryptocurrency prices is regulatory fears. Fears of increased global regulation have been the culprit in several big cryptocurrency sell-offs this year. The South Korean cryptocurrency saga in particular caused quite a bit of volatility. This time, it's closer to home. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating. To be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge. This comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months. A good thing? As I've written before, cryptocurrency regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing . Rather, it is the uncertainty surrounding regulation that drives the market crazy. Regulation could be a good thing over the long term for cryptocurrencies. A regulated market would likely attract more institutional investors, and I don't think any legitimate cryptocurrency believer thinks that getting rid of scams is a bad thing for the industry. And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption -- volatility. In the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.
