It would work like overnight money-market sweep accounts.\n“Every dollar you have that’s not paper gets swept into an overnight rate somewhere,” said Robert Leshner, founder and chief executive at Compound. “That’s exactly what we’re trying to create.”\nSo, first of all, what is your numéraire? Money-market funds aim to achieve a stable value, but in what currency? One assumes it is whatever gets swept: If you have 100 Bitcoins that get swept overnight on Monday, you’d hope that they’d come back worth like 100.01 Bitcoins on Tuesday, even if those 100.01 Tuesday Bitcoins are worth twice, or half, as many dollars as the 100 Monday ones. Leshner explains by email:\nYou have 100 bitcoins, and you send them to Compound&apos;s smart contract.\nThey get loaned to traders who want to buy even more volatile investments (like other tokens) using the bitcoin, or to short-sellers who hate bitcoin, and want to sell it for dollars. Those borrowers have to maintain an excess of collateral (any other tokenized asset) at Compound.\nThe next day you have … 100.01 bitcoins inside Compound.\nOkay sure but … “even more volatile” is … pretty volatile? Like, if I borrow $100 from you to buy three magic beans, and I overcollateralize that loan by leaving six magic beans with you, you are still exposed to the vagaries of the magic-bean market, you know? I worry that a Bitcoin money-market fund that makes its money by, like, margin lending to initial-coin-offering speculators might run the risk of breaking the buck (the Bitcoin) with some frequency.\nBut there is a deeper conceptual strangeness to this. I used to design derivatives for a living at an investment bank. Occasionally in derivatives design you need to put a pot of cash somewhere, and it was a dumb slow revelation to me how hard it is to … just … have ... a pot of cash. You can keep $20 in your wallet, but if you want to hold $20 million, then you will face a series of agonizing choices. You can keep it all in literal cash—in boxes of $20 bills in the corner of your office—but that is not very secure and not very convenient; if you want to send it to someone you have to put the boxes on a plane with a security guard. And there is no convenient electronic form of just, in the strictest sense, cash . You can put your dollars in a bank account, but the bank could go bust. (Deposit insurance has limits.) You can buy Treasury bills, but those mature, and meanwhile can lose (a tiny bit of) value as interest rates change. You can put your money into a money-market fund, but that could, however improbably, lose value too . None of these risks are all that material over an overnight time horizon. But if you have a lot of dollars, and your quite modest goal is “I want to have always exactly this amount of dollars on every day in the future, accessible anywhere, with absolutely no credit or market risk of any kind,” you can’t do it .\nIt is a little boggling, honestly. The reason all of everyone’s dollars are always getting swept up into an overnight rate somewhere—it’s not just because people have a deep desire to get paid interest; it’s also because those dollars have to go somewhere . They can never rest; even your most idle savings-account dollar is constantly being blasted through the economy, being put to use by someone else while you sleep. The interest compensates you for the uncanniness of having to hold your dollars through someone, some not-perfectly-riskless entity. It tells you something about the nature of dollars: that they are not pure entities that you can just conveniently own, that they are instead always somehow obligations of someone else, that they exist only as some form of debt.\nThat is the thing that Bitcoin is solving . Bitcoin is a form of cash that can be held directly by anyone in purely electronic portable transferable form without a bank. (Or a money-market sweep account.) “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” The reason the cash in your brokerage account gets swept into money-market funds every night is that it’d be idiotic for your broker to keep a bunch of $20 bills in an envelope with your name on it. The reason the Bitcoins in your Bitcoin-exchange account don’t get swept into money-market funds every night is that it’s easy for a Bitcoin exchange to hold onto those Bitcoins electronically, because that is the whole point of Bitcoin.\nI mean, that is one reason; the other reason is that no one thought of a crypto-money-market sweep account yet. Now they have! Now instead of just directly owning Bitcoins in decentralized form, you can own them through an exchange, and it can own them through a Compound smart contract, and the contract can lend them to some ICO speculator or Bitcoin short-seller, and your Bitcoins can bop off around the blockchain doing productive work in weird places while you sleep, and the whole regular financial system can be recreated in a slightly skewed way.\nHoweyCoin.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to demonstrate the risk of unregistered initial coin offerings, launched its own fake ICO for “HoweyCoins.” I mean, they were not especially committed to the premise; as far as I can tell they put up a website for HoweyCoins and also simultaneously a different and better publicized website explaining that “If You Responded To An Investment Offer Like This, You Could Have Been Scammed – HoweyCoins Are Completely Fake!” Anyway like 20 of you sent me this story; I don’t think I’ve ever had more readers mention anything to me. It does make sense that the audience for Money Stuff and the audience for SEC pranks would overlap perfectly.\nThe prank is, I don’t know, fine I guess? The white paper has some good parody blather like “By undercutting the monopoly role of the national governments in creating currency, savings that you may not realize are being kept by the elite and the government will flow to you—the consumer.” But it is missing all the … like … crypto -blather? There are no incomprehensible sections on technical implementation, no funny diagrams explaining how the coin works, no bios of the technical team. The word “blockchain” appears only four times in eight pages; the words “hash” and “ERC-20” don’t appear at all. It’s just a little thin. We talked a while back about a prank that the Alberta Securities Commission pulled, in which they ran a fake investment seminar “to educate Albertans about the realities of investment fraud.” “Everything about the fake investment opportunity – from the company&apos;s name and logo, to Jonathan Fisher&apos;s bio and the colour of his tie – was extensively researched,” read the story, and I mentioned that running prank investment frauds for a securities regulator would be a dream job. Next time the SEC wants a prank ICO I’d be happy to help!\nAlso guys the name. I get it. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. is the Supreme Court case that created the modern test—widely referred to as the “Howey Test”—for what counts as a “security,” a question of significant interest to people trying to figure out which ICOs need to be registered with the SEC. If you are a securities lawyer who works on ICOs, you probably got a teeny grim chuckle out of that. But it doesn’t make sense within the world the SEC is building . HoweyCoin’s pitch is vaguely about travel benefits. It should be called TravelCoin or TripBit or CryptoVoyage, something that makes the reader think “oh yes this was named by someone who thought it was a coin for travel benefits,” not, like, “oh yes this was named by securities lawyers playing a prank.”\nOops!\nThere is a common but erroneous belief that securities fraud is only securities fraud when it involves publicly traded companies. “If a public company did this, it would be securities fraud,” people sometimes say about stuff that private companies do that is in fact securities fraud. There is nothing particularly in the law to support this view, but there is an understandable intuition behind it. Regular people buy shares of public companies based on information provided by the companies: Mom-and-pop investors can read a company’s securities filings and decide to buy its stock on the stock exchange, and if those filings are full of lies then the company is entirely to blame and the investors are innocent victims.\nBut private transactions are a little different. Private companies, of course, disclose less information publicly than public ones do. But when venture capitalists buy stakes in private tech companies, or when private-equity firms do leveraged buyouts, they tend to get a lot more information about the companies than regular public investors do when they buy stock on the stock exchange. This is called “due diligence,” and the idea is that sophisticated private investors who are writing very large checks are supposed to be able to ask good questions, and get satisfying answers to those questions, before writing those checks.\nIn practice this often isn’t true—big sexy tech unicorns can raise money with essentially no financial information—but it actually matters that it is true in theory. If you are a sophisticated private-equity investor writing a $100-million check to buy a company, and you have the opportunity to do due diligence and interview company management and review the financial statements and talk to the auditors and examine the customer lists and so forth, and the company sends you a pack of lies, and you don’t catch them and buy the company anyway, then yes, of course, that is the company’s fault, and the company did a bad thing, but it is also your fault too, in a way that it isn’t a public investor’s fault. Your job is to notice that stuff!\nAnd so for instance Theranos Inc.’s private investors , who were victims of a “ massive fraud ,” get quite unsympathetic press : They were rich and sophisticated and had every opportunity to do due diligence, and if they got hoodwinked then that reflects almost as badly on them as it does on the hoodwinkers. It is embarrassing to be the victim of securities fraud when you are a sophisticated large investor who had the opportunity to do due diligence, which means that these frauds are less likely to be pursued than frauds against public investors. Who would want to report them?\nYesterday the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice brought civil and criminal securities-fraud cases against three former executives of Constellation Healthcare Technologies Inc. Constellation was actually a publicly traded company, but the fraud charges are not about its public trading—which occurred on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market and is therefore none of the SEC’s business—but about a going-private transaction that it completed in early 2017. The buyer was Chinh Chu , who left the Blackstone Group LP to start his own buyout firm, and who put up $82.5 million of equity and borrowed $130 million from banks to do the deal. “Sources who have spoken with Mr Chu say he’s ‘comfortable’ proceeding, having spent $7m and three months work on due diligence alone,” reported Paul Murphy at the time .\nIt didn’t work! Constellation went bankrupt this March, and according to the SEC it was kind of fake. For instance, the SEC tells the story of Constellation’s acquisition of MDRX Medical Billing LLC for $30 million:\nIn reality, MDRX too was a fabrication that Defendants had created based on a genuine Akron, Ohio-based medical-billing business (the “Real Medical-Billing Business”). In October 2015, CHT was contacted by an investment bank about a potential acquisition of the Real Medical-Billing Business.\nCHT entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the investment bank, which in turn gave Defendants a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation pitching the Real Medical-Billing Business. …\nThe Defendants then altered the investment bank’s PowerPoint presentation pitching the Real Medical-Billing Business to create a sham MDRX “Due Diligence Findings Draft Report” dated October 20, 2015. The sham MDRX report essentially left the entire description of the Real Medical-Billing Business, including the company’s organizational chart, untouched, but inflated the company’s financials and simply changed the company’s name to MDRX, an entirely fictitious entity.\nEmails among Defendants evidence their fabrication of MDRX. On October 22, 2015, Chivukula forwarded the MDRX PowerPoint to Parmar and Zaharis, noting, “Attached is the updated internal document and presentation. I am not able to remove the background image of [the Real Medical-Billing Business] in the presentation. ”\nAnd the executives allegedly provided all sorts of fake stuff during Chu’s due diligence; the SEC says that he “relied on Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and false and fabricated documents in determining whether to enter into the transaction.” You would hope that, in a nine-digit transaction led by a top-tier buyout expert and financed with bank loans, with months of due diligence, someone would notice that, you know, the company’s medical billing business was plagiarized from a real business and still had the real business’s logo in the background. “The filings give us the impression the alleged fraud was less ‘large, complex and brazen’ than the bankruptcy declaration makes it sound, and rather more maladroit and hapless,” writes Alexandra Scaggs , and while I am not sure I completely agree, really you never want to be suckered as badly as this, even by a complex fraud. If the allegations are true then the perpetrators are bad and might go to jail, but it is hard to escape the feeling that the victims look bad too.\nCBS v. Redstone.\nWe’ve talked over the last two days about the terrific drama over CBS Corp.’s board of director’s effort to get rid of its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., by diluting away its voting stock. A lot happened in that case yesterday—first NAI amended CBS’s bylaws to take away the board’s power to dilute it, and then a Delaware court ordered NAI not to interfere with CBS’s preparations to hold the board meeting today to vote on diluting NAI—but in another sense nothing really happened. CBS still wants to dilute NAI, NAI still doesn’t want to be diluted, what will happen still turns entirely on the decision of the Delaware chancellor hearing the case, and he still hasn’t decided. But he’s supposed to decide today, before the 5 p.m. board meeting, so that is something to look forward to.\nI actually think this case is extremely straightforward: No, obviously, a board of directors cannot get rid of a controlling shareholder just because they are worried that she might fire them! She’s allowed to fire them! That’s what being a controlling shareholder means! But I am not a Delaware chancellor. And I guess if I were I would draw out the suspense a little. Why not? I bet it’s the most fun he’s had in years. “I&apos;ve never seen anything like what&apos;s transpired here in terms of moving parts,” he said , at the end of yesterday’s hearing.\nHedge-fund names.\nHere is a word cloud or whatever from SumZero of common features of hedge-fund names , if you are looking for inspiration for your own fund. “Popular themes that popped up on their word chart included nautical terms, alcoholic drinks, and cities in New England,” so please invest in my new fund, Swampscott Tequila Yacht Capital LP.\nThings happen.\n‘I Am the Mastermind’: Mohammed bin Salman’s Guide to Getting Rich.

I also don’t know what cryptocurrency is. I think it’s some kind of money, but I don’t know how it works and I’m afraid to ask someone.”\nHe also said he doesn’t know who Meek Mill is or why people like Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, are concerned with him.\n“There’s been a lot said and written about Meek Mill. I’m sure Kraft and everyone else involved has a very good reason to be concerned about Meek Mill, I just don’t know why and it’s not information I’m planning to seek out,” the man added.\nThe man said he only has so much room in his brain for information, so he is selective about what he lets in, because that means he must let something else out.\n“If you were to put me on a psychiatrists’ couch, you’d probably wonder why I have held on to trivial information all these years about things like sitcoms. I know way too much about TV shows from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, even obscure ones like Carter Country, Working Stiffs, and Amen. I should cycle this information out and make room for other stuff, but I probably won’t because it gives me comfort,” he explained.\nHe added that he doesn’t know the difference between a psychiatrist and psychologist.\n“I know they mean sort of the same thing, but I don’t know the difference and I won’t find out. I’ll probably just keep referencing them in the wrong way until someone points it out to me,” he continued.\nHe also admitted to not knowing what fibromyalgia is.\n“I love saying fibromyalgia, it’s a cool sounding word, but I don’t know what it means.

Now, a new court filing has thrown a wrench into a recent high-stakes lawsuit that attempts to shed light on the mysterious origins of the cryptocurrency.\nThe new amended complaint submitted late Monday in the ongoing case of Kleiman v. Wright (which is underway in a West Palm Beach, Florida, federal court) makes a bombshell claim.\nThe lawsuit now argues that Craig Wright recently lied about his supposed lack of connections to a Florida-based bitcoin-related company. Wright apparently co-founded and co-owned the company with a now-deceased Florida man who had a significant role in the early days of bitcoin: Dave Kleiman. (Gizmodo outlined the links between the men in a substantive May 2016 article.)\nWright is best known for his questionable 2016 claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s mythical creator. The lawsuit previously noted that it is “unclear” whether Kleiman, Wright, or both men “invented bitcoin.”\nThe new filing plainly states that Wright has committed a “fraud on this court” when he claimed that he had no connection to this Florida company even though he had informed an Australian court of the exact opposite years earlier.\nIn February 2018, the lawyer representing the Kleiman estate, Devin “Velvel” Freedman , told Ars that the estate of the late Dave Kleiman is owed, by Wright’s own admission, at least 300,000 bitcoins (worth more than $3 billion today).\nWhy? In the early days of bitcoin (2011), Kleiman and Wright founded a Florida-based bitcoin company that they purportedly split 50-50: W&K Info Defense Research LLC.\nFurther Reading\nCraig Wright: “I don’t have the courage” to prove I’m Satoshi Nakamoto Tragically, Kleiman died suddenly in April 2013, but he seems to have told no one about his involvement in bitcoin and made no obvious way for his heirs to claim the fortune that he had amassed in bitcoins. Then, six months later, Wright sued W&K in an Australian court in an attempt to reclaim money and intellectual property that he, Wright, believed that he was owed.\nAfter Dave Kleiman’s death, Wright first contacted Dave’s brother, Ira Kleiman, on February 15, 2014 (days after first reaching out to their elderly father). Wright informed Ira of the bitcoin partnership that he and Dave had formed.\nBut Wright claimed, as the lawsuit describes, that Dave had signed his rights away “in exchange for non-controlling shares of a non-operational Australian company worth ‘millions.’ Craig told Ira he’d be able to sell Dave’s stake in the company in a few months. This was a lie. The company went bankrupt after Craig apparently misled the Australian Tax Office (‘ATO’).”\nIn April 2018, Ira Kleiman reinstated W&K as a Florida corporation, which had previously been dissolved. That same month, Wright himself submitted a formal court declaration that accompanied his motion to dismiss the case, denying that he had anything to do with W&K at all.\nAs he wrote :\nI have never shared in the profits or had a duty to share in the losses of W&K or any Florida business.\nI have never been an agent of W&K or any Florida business.\nI have never been a director, member, shareholder, officer, employee, or representative of W&K or of any Florida business.\nI have never exercised authority or control over W&K or any Florida business and have not had any right to exercise authority or control over W&K or any Florida business.\nFurther Reading\nCraig Wright’s proof that he invented Bitcoin: “F**k off, I’m not going to jump through hoops” But in the newly public Australian affidavit from the 2013 Australian lawsuit of Wright v. W&K Info Defense Research LLC, Wright specifically says that he and Kleiman were co-owners of the company:\nThe shareholding of W&K Info Defense was:\n1. Craig S. Wright 50.0 %2. David A. Kleiman 50.0 %\nThe newly amended complaint in the Florida case continues :\nCraig then doubled down on this ownership structure affirming further that “W&K Info Defense LLC was an incorporated partnership. All shares are held jointly.” (Id.). He then affirmed that he called a “shareholders meeting” on August 16, 2013 at which only he and Jamie Wilson were present. (Id.). Craig affirmed he was the sole vote that nominated Jamie Wilson to act as a director “for purposes of consenting to orders and the company to be wound down.” (Id. at 5).27 165.\nThese affidavit statements, in Freedman’s view, directly contradict Wright’s sworn statements that he had never been a shareholder or member of W&K and had never “exercised authority or control” over the company.\n“Craig’s boldfaced misrepresentations and perjury before this Court constitute a continuation of his grand fraud to unlawfully take Plaintiffs’ assets,” Freedman continued in the new filing. “Said differently, Craig’s latest fraud on this Florida Court is simply one more action he’s taken in Florida to defraud Dave’s estate and W&K.”\nWright did not respond to Ars’ request for comment by Twitter and email.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4463164-GetDocument-2.html", "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/05/craig-wright-i-dont-have-the-courage-to-prove-im-satoshi-nakamoto/", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462662-24.html#document/p39/a423240", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390526-Gov-Uscourts-Flsd-521536-1-12.html#document/p2/a407031", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462663-24-4.html#document/p5/a423127", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4460910-DE-12-02-2018-04-16-Ex-B-to-Motion-to-Dismiss.html#document/p2/a422956", "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/02/self-proclaimed-bitcoin-creator-accused-of-5-billion-crypto-heist/", "https://twitter.com/cfarivar/status/996411632271085569", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462662-24.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390477-ConvertTiffToPDF.html", "https://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692", "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/craig-wrights-proof-that-he-invented-bitcoin-fuck-off-im-not-going-to-jump-through-hoops/", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4460911-DE-12-00-2018-04-16-Motion-to-Dismiss-the.html", "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/man-who-claims-he-created-bitcoin-committed-perjury-lawsuit-says/", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462662-24.html#document/p38/a423201", "https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/velvel-devin-freedman.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gizmodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave kleiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kleiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig wright", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "west palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:41:30.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c1254964d37d9162fd074f1ee5019fd52ae23c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3zF36D5V2220BGUGpw8dEG0k3.9R2lngiZOaZz0c7pfhVweoYn6ImCR9TOkcgBBeyg--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not A Bubble, Bitcoin Is", "title_full": "E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not A Bubble, Bitcoin Is", "published": "2018-05-17T17:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c1254964d37d9162fd074f1ee5019fd52ae23c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3zF36D5V2220BGUGpw8dEG0k3.9R2lngiZOaZz0c7pfhVweoYn6ImCR9TOkcgBBeyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T17:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not A Bubble, Bitcoin Is", "text": "Home » bitcoin » crypto » crypto news » news » E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not A Bubble, Bitcoin Is E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not A Bubble, Bitcoin Is bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nJack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, says he has been researching blockchain for years, but thinks Bitcoin is a bubble. Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba , spoke out at the 2nd World Intelligence Conference in Tianjin, saying that blockchain technology is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is, Wednesday, May 16.\nMa said he has been researching blockchain for years, and believes strongly in its potential to address issues of data privacy and security for society at all levels - governments, corporations and individuals - in an \"era of big data.” He stressed that security is a top priority for the e-commerce conglomerate, which reported $39.9 bln in yearly revenue in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings release, and has a trading volume of “trillions of transactions.”\nMa added that regrettably, much of the attention the emerging blockchain industry receives comes from speculators who view blockchain as a “huge gold mine.” Ma was wary of Bitcoin even during its peak in December 2017, reportedly telling CNBC Shanghai at the time:\n\"I don't know about Bitcoin at all. I'm particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don't think we are ready. So I'm still paying attention to Alipay ... to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don't care about Bitcoin.\"\nLast year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln. The overwhelmingly popular mobile payment app Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, reportedly has 450 mln users.\nAs early as summer 2016, Ant Financial, introduced blockchain technology to improve accountability in its work with the Chinese charity industry, going on to recruit blockchain experts in the company at large the following year.\nHowever, in line with Ma’s position, Alibaba Group has stopped short of embracing cryptocurrencies, with Alibaba Cloud recently denying rumours its newly launched ‘P2P Nodes’ network was a cryptocurrency mining platform. Later, in April, Alibaba subsidiary Taobao banned all ICO-related advertising from its platform. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://uk.businessinsider.com/alibabas-revenue-soaring-despite-costly-investments-2018-5?r=US&IR=T", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/alibabas-taobao-expands-crypto-regulations-by-banning-icos-and-associated-services", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-revolution-is-on-alibaba-to-make-donations-trackable", "http://www.8btc.com/mayun-bitcoin-is-bubble", "https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/alipay-first-data-us-point-of-sale-expansion/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-alibaba-says-new-p2p-platform-is-not-crypto-related", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/alibaba", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-09/asia-s-richest-man-sees-net-worth-soar-2-8-billion-in-a-day?cmpid=socialflow-facebook-markets&utm_content=markets&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-chinas-60-billion-alipay-is-recruiting-blockchain-engineers-experts", "http://www.wicongress.org/en"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "e-commerce giant alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tianjin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:26:23.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "204b9e748c39bb63d65db89a0ff1d33a914185fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8rUT5XhVGsI50lkQVuYcMUCuEwie6lHesbpjWV6M_X2e_u8R1GB6aKAfTWKoN.sJbQRcazNU3B08_aIrsHE3Lm0XTteL81bQhXv8xsT724IDHk3JKHJEgn", "site_full": "www.abcmoney.co.uk", "site": "abcmoney.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "ABC Money", "title": "The Advantages of Bitcoin Compared to Alternatives", "title_full": "The Advantages of Bitcoin Compared to Alternatives", "published": "2018-05-17T17:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "204b9e748c39bb63d65db89a0ff1d33a914185fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8rUT5XhVGsI50lkQVuYcMUCuEwie6lHesbpjWV6M_X2e_u8R1GB6aKAfTWKoN.sJbQRcazNU3B08_aIrsHE3Lm0XTteL81bQhXv8xsT724IDHk3JKHJEgn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jim Bevin", "published": "2018-05-17T17:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Advantages of Bitcoin Compared to Alternatives", "text": "The Advantages of Bitcoin Compared to Alternatives 19 SHARES\nBitcoin was the first major player in the cryptocurrency boom that has recently been sweeping the world. It has since been joined by other coins, some of which act in a similar manner, others of which are intended to fill a completely different niche. That has left followers of cryptocurrency with a set of interesting decisions when it comes to deciding where to spend their investment capital. Some may prefer to go with Bitcoin, while others might be a bit more adventurousness and look into some of the alternative coins that are springing up everywhere.\nIdeally, either choice would be a lucrative one, but, just as it rare for all stocks to go up in price in unison, so too is it unlikely that every single digital coin with surge upwards together. Investors have to be careful, and some prefer to do their investing with the expertise of a trading program such as Bitcoin Loophole helping them out . Choosing between Bitcoin and the so-called “alt-coins” may come down to your temperament as an investor, you short-term and long-term goals, and the way the winds are blowing in terms of news surrounding the coins. Bitcoin Sets the Standard\nCryptocurrency is, at the moment, an extremely volatile market, characterized by wild swings in value. Within that realm, however, Bitcoin is a bit more stable than the others. That’s because Bitcoin is the standard in the industry, and it is also on top in terms of its market share. The higher price of it means that it is less likely to undergo a shift that really damages your investment in one fell swoop, as can possibly be the case with the alt-coins. Room to Move\nIn the case of Bitcoin, it has already risen to an impressive level. As a result, even though it still has some leeway for growth, it would be hard for investors to make monumental profits off it if they are just getting into the game now. By contrast, many of the alt-coins can be bought for a relatively small price. If one of them should ever reach the same rarefied air as Bitcoin, it’s conceivable that you could gain massive profits. The Middle Ground\nThere are many coins outside of Bitcoin that might be a little younger and less expensive but have still established themselves over a solid period of time. These coins would rest between Bitcoin and the newcomers on the scale, and they could provide an excellent entry point for those investors who want a modicum of stability but still envy the potential for astronomic growth. Perhaps collecting a portfolio filled with these middle options, along with small exposure to Bitcoin and a dart throw or two at some of the newest coins on the market with promising potential, is a good way to balance out your cryptocurrency dealings.\nIt’s important to realize all of the options you have in the crypto world . In that way, you can decide if Bitcoin is the only choice for you, or if you’d like to sample some of the different coins on the market.

Contact me on earn.com/chl0r0phil or on Twitter @phil_geiger May 17 Bitcoin ends the era of inflation Fiat currencies are so 20th century Richard Nixon fatally wounded government issued money in 1971 by removing the world from the gold standard and ending nearly 700 years of paper money used as an official IOU for gold or other precious metals. Before 1971, the additional production of USD had to (at least partially) coincide with the production of additional Gold. Now, the production of USD costs essentially nothing. The new strategy for monetary policy is to print enough to be able to make your monthly debt payments, while not printing too quickly so that the people in your country lose faith in the currency. Adding to the national debt is a (short-term) non-issue as long as people still believe in your national currency. Faith is the value proposition for today’s government-mandated (fiat) currencies. But the rules of today’s fiat currencies are stacked against the citizens. Individual citizens don’t have any say in how much currency is created, or how far governments go into debt because governments/central banks control the money that the citizens are mandated to use. Since there is an unlimited potential supply, governments and industries that are “too-big-to-fail,” as designated by the money creators, can be bailed out at any time by just creating more money. This strategy comes at a very high long-term cost for the citizens because printing money is not the same as generating wealth. Citizens experience the repercussions by watching everything around them get more and more expensive. Spending $350,000 on a dilapidated shack in San Francisco means not only that demand for land is very high. It also means that demand for each dollar is getting lower. It’s simple economics, son. I don’t understand it at all, but God I love it . Bitcoin permanently solves monetary inflation by removing monetary policy control from individuals and replacing it with rigid software. No matter how much energy is spent in creating new Bitcoins, there will never be more than 21 million unless an overwhelming majority (>95%) of the BTC community agrees, and I will never agree. If you own 50 million satoshis (.5 Bitcoin), you own exactly 1/42 million of the entire Bitcoin network. It’s impossible to measure the fraction of total USD or Euro you own because legacy currencies have no limit to the supply. Nobody is mandating that you use Bitcoin, and any upgrade to the network requires your approval if you choose to fully participate. Other cryptocurrencies might add additional bells and whistles to Bitcoin and market the functionality as disruptive, but using alternative cryptocurrencies long-term means perpetuating the idea of monetary inflation. There can be an unlimited number of different cryptocurrencies created thanks to Bitcoin’s working solution to the Byzantine General’s problem , but there will forever be only 21 million Bitcoins. Other cryptocurrencies are not disruptive. They accept the status quo; that money can and should be inflated. Making a choice to refuse inflation by using Bitcoin is one of the most profoundly disruptive actions you can take.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been quoted in the media recently.\nIn their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the “Oracle of Omaha” has a general distaste for bitcoin.\nFor those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as “rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual shareholder meeting. The Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets\nOne of the key counterarguments to Buffett’s assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna.\n“Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven’t taken the time to really understand what’s going on here,” said Wilson. “If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you’ll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn’t exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we’re going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.”\nThe LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the “Web 2.0” phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed “Web 3.0.” This Is Very Different From Buffett’s World\nWilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett’s approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains.\nTalking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them.\n“The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,” said Wilson.\nIn short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market.\n“There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we’ve ever seen,” Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem.\nWhile Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved.\nAdditionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-says-bitcoin-is-probably-rat-poison-squared.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:24:08.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "363b41f96406a41cbe99ec54ac67f3e57986c7ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3.Tm83csfunAX1IGkvS2ROdqPVJSebXoPFVvKbcbSwIWPnePw7q8Bee0UQGSEBv3yg--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet", "title_full": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet", "published": "2018-05-17T17:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "363b41f96406a41cbe99ec54ac67f3e57986c7ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3.Tm83csfunAX1IGkvS2ROdqPVJSebXoPFVvKbcbSwIWPnePw7q8Bee0UQGSEBv3yg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T17:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet", "text": "Home » bitcoin » bitcoinist » crypto » news » Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nOn Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and the Square payment company expressed his positive cryptocurrency sentiment as he stood on stage at the Consensus conference, saying that Bitcoin should be the cryptocurrency of the internet. Jack Dorsey: Cryptocurrency Evangelist\nTwitter has long been a platform that has been centric for cryptocurrency users and organizations. It quickly became a way in which crypto-related entities could convey announcements and talk about cryptocurrencies with members of the community.\nThis may have been no accident as Twitter’s CEO, who also runs the mobile payment processor, Square , has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies at this year’s Consensus conference.\nWhile Jack Dorsey was on stage at Consensus, the CEO of Twitter and Square stated :\nThe internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.\nDorsey also added that he is a “huge fan” of the growing industry and supports the technologies which help to assist cryptocurrencies and related developments. Square CEO Jack Dorsey wants his company to be at the forefront of getting cryptocurrency accepted as legitimate means of global payment. https://t.co/xfIYMAgNak\n— CNBC (@CNBC) May 16, 2018 Tech Giants vs ICO Advertisements\nDespite the CEO’s positive outlook on the cryptocurrency space, Twitter has shown a negative attitude toward the release of cryptocurrency-related ads on their service, banning ICO and cryptocurrency crowd sale advertisements in March.\nA Twitter spokesperson gave CNBC a statement on the matter, saying:\nWe are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.\nThis announcement came after similar announcements from Google and Facebook, who also banned ads related to cryptocurrency crowd sales from their respective platforms.\nAlthough it may be a bit late, Microsoft’s Bing platform has joined the ranks of those banning cryptocurrency advertisements, announcing that they would do the same just the other day.\nIn direct contradiction of Twitter’s ban of ICO advertisements, Dorsey’s other venture, Square, has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies, launching Bitcoin trading on one of its apps in January.\nThe launch of Bitcoin trading on their Cash platform was the first move which Square made into the cryptocurrency space. As of yet, Square has yet to accept cryptocurrencies as a way in which consumers can pay merchants for products, who have traditionally used high-fee credit cards.\nBut it seems that Square does have plans to accept a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in the future, as Dorsey noted:\nIf we were able to use it (Bitcoin) as a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.\nThe possibility of an addition of cryptocurrencies to the Square platform may be promising for the industry as Square has been growing faster than Paypal’s subsidiary, Venmo, another upcoming payment processing platform.\nThe aforementioned addition of cryptocurrency trading to Square’s Cash platform was an unbridled success, as millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were quickly sold on the platform. At the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2018, Square reported that they had sold $34.1 million worth of Bitcoin in their first quarter, spending $33.9 million to acquire the same Bitcoin.\nDespite the success of the arrival of cryptocurrency trading on Square, it was still a controversial topic within the internal structure of the company. In Dorsey’s speech at Consensus, he mentioned, “We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology.” He even mentioned how the debate over the addition of cryptocurrencies was prevalent “all the way at the board level.”\nEven with the presence of “healthy discussion” about cryptos at Square, with Jack Dorsey at the helm, it can be assured that Square will continue to make moves to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhat do you think of Jack Dorsey’s statements? Do you like them, hate them, or are indifferent? What moves do you think Twitter and Square should make to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies and related technologies? We would love to know what you have to say, so let us know in the comments below.\nImages Courtesy of Twitter/@CNBC, Reuters, howldb.com, Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://bitcoinist.com/google-ban-cryptocurrency-ads-bitcoin-not-affected/", "http://bitcoinist.com/square-traded-34-1m-bitcoin-first-4-months/", "https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/996865393594642432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://bitcoinist.com/twitter-confirms-ban-cryptocurrency-ads/", "http://bitcoinist.com/facebook-banning-ico-ads-good-thing-crypto/", "https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/16/squares-bitcoin-move-causes-internal-disagreement/", "http://bitcoinist.com/squares-cash-app-helps-make-bitcoin-accessible/", "http://bitcoinist.com/first-facebook-and-google-now-bing-moves-to-ban-cryptocurrency-advertising/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/twitter-ceo-wants-bitcoin-to-be-the-internets-native-currency.html", "http://bitcoinist.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-support-bitcoin-broaden-financial-access/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:26:25.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f18f17aa6b64dd7997067f1a9b675b1a57d09110", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcRLTvYkmyuLIvpjYnHNKVKxhlY3SWtS9KRvOPz3CjohlXUIE_QL0W7", "site_full": "coinnews.tv", "site": "coinnews.tv", "site_section": "http://coinnews.tv", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Coin News", "title": "IS BITCOIN ANONYMOUS?", "title_full": "IS BITCOIN ANONYMOUS?", "published": "2018-05-17T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f18f17aa6b64dd7997067f1a9b675b1a57d09110", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcRLTvYkmyuLIvpjYnHNKVKxhlY3SWtS9KRvOPz3CjohlXUIE_QL0W7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cranbak", "published": "2018-05-17T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "IS BITCOIN ANONYMOUS?", "text": "May 17 No Comments\nArticle posted at The Market Oracle http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article62294.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "financial markets analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:15:31.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "baeb76e11d024c805848a456ee2469d7699b5c0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSL4jLVmYoN8dmnYXlYkbNjQjh2.caOVgOSLBPxNpe06Xh84lNfKqAgF0eIdjWw9LS2MfjLRrtKItFaj_w36pApcI53V.Hwk9bixVsGefWduXy0VMqFRM5U", "site_full": "coinidol.com", "site": "coinidol.com", "site_section": "https://coinidol.com/rssshort", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Pay Less and Find out More: Buy Tickets to Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Finland for a Favorable Price", "title_full": "Pay Less and Find out More: Buy Tickets to Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Finland for a Favorable Price", "published": "2018-05-17T17:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://coinidol.com", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "baeb76e11d024c805848a456ee2469d7699b5c0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSL4jLVmYoN8dmnYXlYkbNjQjh2.caOVgOSLBPxNpe06Xh84lNfKqAgF0eIdjWw9LS2MfjLRrtKItFaj_w36pApcI53V.Hwk9bixVsGefWduXy0VMqFRM5U", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T17:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pay Less and Find out More: Buy Tickets to Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Finland for a Favorable Price", "text": "Pay Less and Find out More: Buy Tickets to Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Finland for a Favorable Price May 17, 2018 at 14:11 // PR Author\nOn May 14-21 only, buy tickets to the first Helsinki-held Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Finland for a special price.\nUntil and including May 21 the price will be 150 EUR\nStandard price = 365 EUR\nStudents, seize even more beneficial offer: register on May 14-24 and buy tickets for 70 EUR only.\nNo promo codes!

Releases Crypto Ratings, Ethereum Comes in First While Bitcoin Lags Behind May 17, 2018 222 Chinese Govt. Releases First Public Crypto Ratings\nThe Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released its inaugural cryptocurrency ratings this Thursday, May 17. Undertaken by the Ministry’s CCID Research Institute, the ratings evaluated 28 currencies, judging them on criteria that examined fundamental technology, applicability, and innovation.\nComing in at the top of the grade, Ethereum earned a total index score of 129.4. It’s followed by Steem (115.9), Lisk (104.8), NEO (103), and Komodo (101.5). Meanwhile, Bitcoin (88.1) comes in at 13th, wedged between BitShares (90.8) and Verge (88.1). Bitcoin’s low mark comes despite it earning the highest score for innovation, a grade it garnered for being the industry’s pioneering currency. 4/ Detailed scores of the first crypto ratings by CCID Research, China’s Ministry of Industry & Information Technology pic.twitter.com/7LiJIWokge\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) May 17, 2018\nThese ratings come four months after the Weiss Ratings Agency unveiled the world’s first index of cryptocurrency grades. Measured with alphabetical ratings, many of Weiss’ original top picks align with the Chinese government’s own, including Ethereum, Steem, and NEO, all of which received B or B- grades. Weiss also gave Bitcoin one of the lower ratings on their initial report with a C+, a move that elicited skepticism from the community at large. As China’s index follows Weiss’ precedent, Bitcoin’s rating is likely to disgruntle Bitcoin maximalists and other blockchain die-hards, while the placement of other currencies–or lack thereof–will no doubt be met with scrutiny by their fan bases, as well.\nUnlike Weiss’ ratings, however, where full access is only available through subscription, the Chinese government’s ratings are publicly accessible, the first ever for the industry. According to domestic reports , the Chinese government believes this transparency will be healthy for future innovation and for properly evaluating each coin’s development.\n“It is reported that the index released this time is the world’s first technology-focused public chain assessment index, which will be issued periodically on a monthly basis. The issuance of this index will help to fully grasp the status quo of global public-chain technology development, timely track the direction of public-chain technology innovation, and help promote the innovation and application of blockchain technology,” Chinese outlet CEN writes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coincentral.com/what-is-bitshares/", "https://coincentral.com/what-is-lisk/", "https://coincentral.com/what-is-neo-cryptocurrency/", "https://coincentral.com/what-is-bitcoin/", "https://coincentral.com/verge-cryptocurrency-xvg-beginners-guide/", "http://cyyw.cena.com.cn/2018-05/17/content_386493.htm", "https://coincentral.com/komodo-platform-beginner-guide/", "https://t.co/7LiJIWokge", "https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/996950431459823616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://coincentral.com/what-is-steem/", "https://coincentral.com/weiss-cryptocurrency-ratings-unveiled-complicated-circumstances/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weiss rati", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccid research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry & information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccid research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:00:42.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "139c020a448b86692668e00ced308c890101f0f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRvB.Xo7TA4LpU1q40m5ONUKw0AzSzvqVRuvfVswldEw4aprnBBiEFJfhYw68_4o4yADHQ_eiLN8g--", "site_full": "investorplace.com", "site": "investorplace.com", "site_section": "http://investorplace.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "| Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips", "title": "Bitcoin Is Going to Sink Square Inc Stock.

Here’s How", "text": "Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)\nSquare Inc (NASDAQ: SQ ) CEO Jack Dorsey was welcomed like a conquering hero to the Consensus 2018 Bitcoin conference this week. The event at the New York Hilton drew 8,400 people at $2,000 per ticket, and Dorsey’s decision to support Bitcoin in Square’s Cash app was the star of the show. This news has been very good for Square stock.\nThe news, however, has not been so good for Bitcoin. Since the start of the year Bitcoin prices have fallen from over $13,400 to less than $8,400 per coin . Square stock, by contrast, is up 56%.\nDorsey got love despite admitting his original plan to treat Bitcoin as cash hasn’t worked. His Cash mobile app will let you buy Bitcoin or sell it , but you can’t buy a pizza with Bitcoin in the app because the transaction costs are too high. The Square Bubble\nIn its first quarter report, Square said it took in $34.1 million from Bitcoin trades. Sounds great, but it spent $33.9 million handling the trades.\nDorsey told the conference using Bitcoin as currency would give Square a global platform, since Bitcoin is traded at the same price around the world. He said the internet will have a “native currency” in time but said he didn’t know if it will be Bitcoin or something else. He drew cheers anyway.\nWhile Square hasn’t pumped up the Bitcoin bubble, it is possible its participation in the cryptocurrency market has revealed a Square bubble. Citron Research, which produces reports for short sellers, recently called it “a collection of yawn businesses” and put a $30 target price on the stock . The shares were slated to open on May 17 at $56.75 each.\nAt that price you’re paying about 10 times last year’s revenues for the shares, and let’s not talk price to earnings ratios because Square isn’t profitable. By way of comparison Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) sells at 15 times revenue, but has a PE of 33 because it brings almost 40% of revenue to the bottom line and pays 84 cents per share in dividends. Compare Brokers A Payments Bubble?\nI have written before that payment processors are part of a market bubble that could pop , but it hasn’t yet. Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ), which I profiled in terms of that bubble last July, has since risen 32%.\nSquare stock, on the other hand, is up 114% since that story came out.\nMany find Square to be more than a payment processor, because it has reached new markets with its mobile phone dongle, its one-size fits most pricing and its ancillary services, including accounting and loans.\nThe micro businesses that Square targeted also don’t seem to abandon it as they grow. I wrote about one such customer for TheStreet.com in 2013 , a local doughnut shop near my home. The shop now has two outlets, still has lines out the door on weekends, and it also still uses Square. The Bottom Line on Square Stock\nTo keep people buying the stock, Square needs to keep generating big growth with bigger numbers. Its first quarter report saw adjusted revenues up 51% year over year, with 20% of customers now processing over $500,000 per year each.\nKeeping up the growth pace over the next year would still leave it at less than half the size of Total System Services, Inc. (NYSE: TSS ), a traditional merchants processor that brought 26% of $1.273 billion in revenue to its net income line for the December quarter, and achieved 20% year over year growth.\nSquare’s market cap opening for trade May 17 was $22.7 billion, TSS’ $15.6 billion.

It will have a native currency,” Dorsey said, as quoted by CoinDesk. “I don't know if it will be bitcoin. I hope it will be bitcoin,\" he said, adding that he was a “huge fan” of the original cryptocurrency.\nDorsey admitted that there was still a lot of scepticism and debate at Square on whether Bitcoin would one day become the basis of all Internet payment. However, he sees this as a good thing.\n“[T]hat's where the magic happens, where creativity happens,\" he said.\nAt the end of January, Square, which is a digital payment company based in San Francisco, enabled Bitcoin trading for most users of its mobile payment application cash The move followed two and a half months of testing, during which the option was available only to a small number of Cash users. Dorsey said at the time that the company supported Bitcoin, because “we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all”.\nSquare’s recent quarterly financial report indicated that the Bitcoin trading operation had so far failed to make a significant impact on the company’s performance . The results showed that the company had made about $34.1 million of Bitcoin-related revenue in the first quarter of the year, representing about 5% of the company’s total Q1 revenue. Square admitted at the time that it had incurred some losses on Bitcoin, but said those were “insignificant”.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-webs-native-currency/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:13:14.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bbb3b8c12805013f757355ef4e4752932e579a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrJD2hLbjYno6w_qv51zUOyDn61ZfHQgT1NGH2SvnhK.j9jh71WNCVLFZ3ELck2K8xmnCSvHcsFC3mYwLC9VCXc", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6860", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "InvestorPlace - Latest Headlines", "title": "Bitcoin Is Going to Sink Square Inc Stock.

Jack Dorsey: Cryptocurrency Evangelist\nTwitter has long been a platform that has been centric for cryptocurrency users and organizations. It quickly became a way in which crypto-related entities could convey announcements and talk about cryptocurrencies with members of the community.\nThis may have been no accident as Twitter’s CEO, who also runs the mobile payment processor, Square , has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies at this year’s Consensus conference.\nWhile Jack Dorsey was on stage at Consensus, the CEO of Twitter and Square stated :\nThe internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.\nDorsey also added that he is a “huge fan” of the growing industry and supports the technologies which help to assist cryptocurrencies and related developments. Square CEO Jack Dorsey wants his company to be at the forefront of getting cryptocurrency accepted as legitimate means of global payment. https://t.co/xfIYMAgNak\n— CNBC (@CNBC) May 16, 2018 Tech Giants vs ICO Advertisements\nDespite the CEO’s positive outlook on the cryptocurrency space, Twitter has shown a negative attitude toward the release of cryptocurrency-related ads on their service, banning ICO and cryptocurrency crowd sale advertisements in March.\nA Twitter spokesperson gave CNBC a statement on the matter, saying:\nWe are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.\nThis announcement came after similar announcements from Google and Facebook, who also banned ads related to cryptocurrency crowd sales from their respective platforms.\nAlthough it may be a bit late, Microsoft’s Bing platform has joined the ranks of those banning cryptocurrency advertisements, announcing that they would do the same just the other day.\nIn direct contradiction of Twitter’s ban of ICO advertisements, Dorsey’s other venture, Square, has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies, launching Bitcoin trading on one of its apps in January.\nThe launch of Bitcoin trading on their Cash platform was the first move which Square made into the cryptocurrency space. As of yet, Square has yet to accept cryptocurrencies as a way in which consumers can pay merchants for products, who have traditionally used high-fee credit cards.\nBut it seems that Square does have plans to accept a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in the future, as Dorsey noted:\nIf we were able to use it (Bitcoin) as a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.\nThe possibility of an addition of cryptocurrencies to the Square platform may be promising for the industry as Square has been growing faster than Paypal’s subsidiary, Venmo, another upcoming payment processing platform.\nThe aforementioned addition of cryptocurrency trading to Square’s Cash platform was an unbridled success, as millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were quickly sold on the platform. At the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2018, Square reported that they had sold $34.1 million worth of Bitcoin in their first quarter, spending $33.9 million to acquire the same Bitcoin.\nDespite the success of the arrival of cryptocurrency trading on Square, it was still a controversial topic within the internal structure of the company. In Dorsey’s speech at Consensus, he mentioned, “We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology.” He even mentioned how the debate over the addition of cryptocurrencies was prevalent “all the way at the board level.”\nEven with the presence of “healthy discussion” about cryptos at Square, with Jack Dorsey at the helm, it can be assured that Square will continue to make moves to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhat do you think of Jack Dorsey’s statements? Do you like them, hate them, or are indifferent? What moves do you think Twitter and Square should make to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies and related technologies? We would love to know what you have to say, so let us know in the comments below.\nImages Courtesy of Twitter/@CNBC, Reuters, howldb.com, Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.co/xfIYMAgNak", "http://bitcoinist.com/google-ban-cryptocurrency-ads-bitcoin-not-affected/", "http://bitcoinist.com/square-traded-34-1m-bitcoin-first-4-months/", "https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/996865393594642432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://bitcoinist.com/twitter-confirms-ban-cryptocurrency-ads/", "http://bitcoinist.com/facebook-banning-ico-ads-good-thing-crypto/", "https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/16/squares-bitcoin-move-causes-internal-disagreement/", "http://bitcoinist.com/squares-cash-app-helps-make-bitcoin-accessible/", "http://bitcoinist.com/first-facebook-and-google-now-bing-moves-to-ban-cryptocurrency-advertising/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/twitter-ceo-wants-bitcoin-to-be-the-internets-native-currency.html", "http://bitcoinist.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-support-bitcoin-broaden-financial-access/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:00:43.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2db98aaac9039989b6e9029c5d207ef8cd2356b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQeclKoGN9S5e4A4ZPOAL7gnmer4fJxT5n6mZMuwUI.lBgCx1..wbY4IrX98AWm97uE34h.ElMnHWftUFQjzAG4ifQifPmkWTM-", "site_full": "itafx.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://itafx.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Italian Forex Group", "title": "Bitcoin vicino al minimo di 6 giorni; l?OCSE valuta le cripto", "title_full": "Bitcoin vicino al minimo di 6 giorni; l?OCSE valuta le cripto", "published": "2018-05-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2db98aaac9039989b6e9029c5d207ef8cd2356b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQeclKoGN9S5e4A4ZPOAL7gnmer4fJxT5n6mZMuwUI.lBgCx1..wbY4IrX98AWm97uE34h.ElMnHWftUFQjzAG4ifQifPmkWTM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Italian Forex Group (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin vicino al minimo di 6 giorni; l?OCSE valuta le cripto", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:00:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34f03fd1170938020c543fe643f58a34c92d6afc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZROwBPGA1T1gyo34QuXBkhGIkc7SOSlmnph7yRasqBNQxsXSycDIhTzTSIWtkkhSnmjAXw6P00EgwbzDfhKGh27EJc_kMPjOw7G9N6ADNernAGhBRDLGbMR", "site_full": "motherboard.vice.com", "site": "vice.com", "site_section": "http://motherboard.vice.com/rss?trk_source=motherboard", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Motherboard", "title": "This Guy Heated Bath Water With Bitcoin Mining and It Worked Too Well", "title_full": "This Guy Heated Bath Water With Bitcoin Mining and It Worked Too Well", "published": "2018-05-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5afc7aa1f3cc4c0009ce4c56/lede/1526496876977-l5goioK.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7492xh;0xw,0.1577xh&amp;resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 173, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1070, "comments": 0, "shares": 1070}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34f03fd1170938020c543fe643f58a34c92d6afc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZROwBPGA1T1gyo34QuXBkhGIkc7SOSlmnph7yRasqBNQxsXSycDIhTzTSIWtkkhSnmjAXw6P00EgwbzDfhKGh27EJc_kMPjOw7G9N6ADNernAGhBRDLGbMR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jordan Pearson", "published": "2018-05-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Guy Heated Bath Water With Bitcoin Mining and It Worked Too Well", "text": "This Guy Heated Bath Water With Bitcoin Mining and It Worked Too Well \"Lee\" used cryptocurrency mining ASICs to heat his bath, which turned the temperature up to 122 Fahrenheit. May 17 2018, 2:00pm Image: Imgur/gta3uzi\nFor hobbyists trying to strike it rich with cryptocurrency mining, but who don’t have access to gigantic warehouses where they can park the hardware, making money means packing a bunch of very loud and very hot computers into your house or apartment.\nSome at-home cryptocurrency miners are harnessing the heat that powerful mining equipment— called ASICs —give off. Motherboard’s Daniel Oberhaus used mining equipment (albeit graphics cards, not ASICs) to stay warm during a storm once, and a Redditor posting under the handle “gta3uzi” just took it to another level. In a Tuesday post by gta3uzi on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit, they revealed a system for heating hot water using ASICs so you can make money while you chill in a steamy bath.\n“Imagine a crypto heated swimming pool, or anything else you could heat with the output from a small, medium, or large-scale mining operation,” gta3uzi wrote on Reddit. Some of their suggestions for using the hot water include creating a sauna, heating a home, drying one’s hair, and even cooking a steak sous vide.\nWhen I reached gta3uzi over Reddit, and then over Twitter, he told me that his name is “Lee” and he works in IT in Alabama. Lee used to mine cryptocurrency with graphics cards, he told me in a message, and when he recently rediscovered an old digital wallet containing the proceeds from that endeavour he decided to reinvest in some ASICs. “After realizing how much waste heat is generated by this equipment I decided to try and recycle it in a productive way,” he told me. Image: Imgur/gta3uzi\nLee’s system—which he set up briefly in January—is “extremely simple,” he told me, and makes use of a water-to-air intercooler like you’d find in a supercharged car . Ambient air is pulled into the system to cool the ASICs, and the heated air is pushed through an intercooler that has water constantly being pumped through it from a source, like a bathtub. The heat is transferred to the water, and voila —computer-heated water suitable for anything you’d normally use hot water for. In fact, Lee told me, it worked a little too well.\n“It was a little too effective if I left it running all day as it produced baths of up to 122F/50C,” he wrote. “Dangerously hot, especially as I have a few pets who could fall in if they somehow gained access to the bathroom. I took the experiment down to preserve the safety of my living space. Safety is an absolute priority to me.”\nLee said that his mining operation made a 10 percent profit after electricity costs before he turned it into a water heater.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China has published ratings of the main public block of networks and digital currencies. The rating is compiled on the basis of three criteria: technology, application and innovation of the network.\nIt is interesting that the Chinese government rated Ethereum as the best network of blockchain network in the world and put it at number 1.\nThe top five included Ethereum, Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo, all of them use smart contracts for efficient and safe processing of information in a decentralized manner.\nAdding Steem to the top five of the Chinese government network rating was unexpected for the community, because unlike Lisk and NEO, Steem is not a blockchain technology that can be used to create decentralized applications. Steem is a content distribution platform. Another unexpected addition to the top 10 ratings was Monero under number 9. Recently, several governments, including the Japanese government and its financial services agency (FSA), expressed their concern over a number of crypto currencies such as Monero and Zcash that are capable of processing anonymous payments, which may be associated with money laundering and criminal activities.\nFurther even more interesting fact was the place of bitcoin on this list. The Chinese Ministry placed the world's cryptocurrency just under 13th number. This is somewhat strange because bitcoin has the most reliable reputation and the longest history as the safest and most capitalized crypto currency in the world market.\nDespite the curiosity of the information and the wide discussion of this list in the fields of the crypto community forums, this information did not have any impact on today's trading activity. The activity of the digital market today is minimal through the week, crypto instruments are within yesterday's levels.

Published on May 16 on Joule, de Vries made use of complex economic models, coupled with publically available electricity costs and mining statistics, with the intentions of producing a scientific paper that companies and individuals can base their research on.\nAccording to de Vries, the worldwide minimum current requirement of Bitcoin is 2.55 gigawatts, equivalent to the electricity usage of Ireland, the world’s 118th largest country by landmass. The researcher also states that this amount equals to half a percent of the world’s total electricity usage.\nThe report suggests that bitcoin mining power consumption this year could equal the usage of Austria. Furthermore, every transaction via the Bitcoin network uses up enough electricity to power an average home in the Netherlands.\nDe Vries, who currently works with PwC Netherlands, believes that the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency may end up using 7.7 gigawatts to power its network by the end of this year, a figure equal to the electricity usage of Austria!\nBad for Bitcoin, Bad For Climate The huge costs associated with Bitcoin mining – a process that “timestamps” transactions and performs extensive calculations – has been a subject of criticism since years. And with the increase in the network’s size, the costs are further poised to grow, possibly consuming 5 percent of the world’s total electricity in the future.\nDe Vries notes:\nYou are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines.\nApplying economic principles to the Bitcoin protocol highly suggests the network reaching a point of equilibrium, which would see the miner’s bitcoin incentives become equal to the computing, hardware, and electricity costs involved.\nWith that in mind, de Vries extrapolated present data to that of the equilibrium point, to determine electricity costs and economic implications in running the Bitcoin network during that period\nSources May Have Skewed Results A telling point remains that of utilizing public data, which de Vries feels could be misleading. Mining companies like Bitmain are highly secretive operations, and official documents pertaining to their operations are largely unavailable.\nHowever, de Vries is confident of his prediction, and says:\nSometimes the best information we’ve got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That’s the stuff we have to work with.\nThe researcher believes that his paper can be referred to by governments and regulatory bodies prior to placing restrictions or introducing laws, as its peer-reviewed, scientific nature supersedes that of anecdotal evidence and weakly researched publications.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText":

Well, we can say that this is already turning this into a dogfight.\nAccording to MarketWatch the number of crypto critics are growing every day including Jamie Dimon, J.P. Morgan’s JPM, Robert Shiller, The Shark Tank guru Mark Cuban and even Bill Gates, who recently said, “I would short bitcoin if I could.”\nIn a recent press release , crypto believer and COO of ECoinmerce Rex Chen responded to Buffett’s statement on Bitcoin:\n“We don’t know exactly what ‘rat poison squared’ is supposed to mean. What we do know is that Bitcoin created a very productive ecosystem and spawned the entire cryptocurrency revolution, which is driving innovation in nearly every industry.”\nECoinmerce is the world’s first decentralized and tokenized marketplace that will offer consumers and retailers a decentralized platform similar to Amazon and Alibaba.\nThe platform will allow consumers to buy as groups for huge discounts, auction goods to each other, and will feature daily deals at huge discounts. Users will also be incentivized to refer friends, share deals with social media followers, and write product reviews for any goods they’ve purchased.\nIn solidarity with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts everywhere, ECoinmerce will start selling everything from t-shirts to coffee mugs with the logo ‘Rat Poison Squared’ on their Marketplace Preview page . Prices will range from $19.99 to $39.99.\n“This clothing line is intended to give Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts pride in their defiance of the status quo and their belief in a better future,” said Chen.

Wallet work without an Internet connection\nThe Internet nowadays is, unfortunately, not perfect and all-encompassing – in many countries there is a stable Internet connection is still a luxury. Adding to that, thanks to the emergence of the Net-neutrality-Abstimminung of the FCC, our Internet may not remain always so private and stable, as we have it today. This Problem is exactly what the New York Startup goTenna is trying to mitigate.\nThe App, which was founded by the Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo in 2012, collaborated with Samourai Wallet this summer, a Android to publish based App, which can run users allows Bitcoin transactions without Internet-connection. Privacy and decentralisation is at the heart\nGoTenna is a tiny radio device that was originally developed as a communication device for the user. It syncs with your phone and allows you to send encrypted messages to other goTenna users within a radius of one kilometre. This System is basically foolproof, since it works even when there is no mobile signal is present, and this is thanks to the Mesh-network is possible, a decades-old System for the use of the Internet without Wi-Fi or fixed network. Since the messages are routed through the Mesh network, they are Essentially untraceable.\nThis idea of privacy and decentralisation struck quickly in the crypto-Community. In an Interview with CoinDesk, goTenna engineer Richard Meyers, explained the possible applications of the Mesh network with crypto currency TRANS-actions.\n“It provides a censorship-resistant Alternative,” said Meyers. “It will disguise who you are and where you are when you make these transactions. So this is a big privacy advantage.“\n“You need to be able to have your Bitcoin in disaster cases,” added Meyers in reference to the recent Work of the Perdomo siblings in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices to connect to the people after Hurricane Maria helped again. “As long as you have to charge a phone, you can communicate and transfer.”\nAnd that’s it – as soon as you are connected to your goTenna device, you can send a Bitcoin transaction, the jumps over the Mesh network, until the recipient is found. The entire process is encrypted, since the Mesh-network of free, unlicensed radio frequencies. Therefore, no one will be able to decrypt your identity, even if someone succeeds, their Bitcoins-Mid-transaction interrupt – which in itself is almost impossible.\nThe goTenna devices will be sold for 179 $ per Pair, so far, more than 100,000 devices have been sold.

Economist Alex de Vries, who published an article on “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” yesterday, May 16, in scientific journal Joule , told the Independent that Bitcoin (BTC) mining will use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by 2018.\nDe Vries concludes that as the BTC network currently consumes about 2.55 GW of electricity and moves towards consuming 7.67 GW in the future (for reference, Ireland consumes 3.1 GW and Austria 8.2 GW), the network “has a big problem, and it is growing fast.” However, he does note that solutions like the Lightning Network “may alleviate the situation.” Bitcoin mining requires energy for performing the calculations - hashes - that give miners Bitcoin rewards. In mid-February, it was reported that crypto mining in the country of Iceland would consume more energy than households in 2018. The debate over whether Bitcoin mining is overly harmful for the environment is seen by some as a non-issue, due to the real need for Bitcoin in underbanked countries.\nDe Vries told the Independent, however, that “half a percent is already quite shocking:”\n“It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.” The scientific study goes into detail about the different types of Bitcoin miners and their individual energy usage, noting that “trying to measure the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date.” De Vries uses Bitmain’s Antminers as his main example to show how much energy each machine uses in its lifetime. As De Vries’s study is the first time data on Bitcoin energy consumption has been peer-reviewed, he hopes his paper will “get the conversation started,” as he believes that the world needs “more scientific discussion on where this network is headed” as opposed to “back-of-the-envelope calculations,” he told the Independent.\nConversely, the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain , is being used to alleviate environmental impact in some cases. This week, IBM announced a partnership with Veridium Labs with the aim of tokenizing carbon credits to allow companies to better track their carbon footprint through blockchain, potentially allowing them to reduce their carbon impact. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/iceland-crypto-mining-companies-will-consume-more-energy-than-households-in-2018", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-costs-more-electricity-than-houses-but-its-a-non-issue", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ibm", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/antminer", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibm-partners-with-veridium-labs-to-let-companies-track-carbon-footprint-via-blockchain", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-mining-energy-use-electricity-cryptocurrency-a8353981.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "peer-reviewed research shows home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peer-reviewed research shows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:26:34.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6af6f073e75b0e94e466c41a2f24da4a689908d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKZ_NGDEdmEJ2Bvtz231XODskqQmdX8s8nA4WgTncWy.ySgnLQSDwAxUI0H6fUXiTwgaqA0eINFLpa2XdL1jaqiKRwBd10FuPoq9HMO16COQmXkGDrGrWiS04Xe.I3q1I-", "site_full": "www.fastcompany.com", "site": "fastcompany.com", "site_section": "http://fastcompany.com//rss.xml", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Fast Company", "title": "Bitcoin is unsustainable, and we now have peer-reviewed proof", "title_full": "Bitcoin is unsustainable, and we now have peer-reviewed proof", "published": "2018-05-17T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/05/p-1-bitcoin-is-unsustainable-and-we-now-have-peer-reviewed-proof.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 3157, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 191, "comments": 0, "shares": 191}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6af6f073e75b0e94e466c41a2f24da4a689908d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKZ_NGDEdmEJ2Bvtz231XODskqQmdX8s8nA4WgTncWy.ySgnLQSDwAxUI0H6fUXiTwgaqA0eINFLpa2XdL1jaqiKRwBd10FuPoq9HMO16COQmXkGDrGrWiS04Xe.I3q1I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cale Guthrie Weissman", "published": "2018-05-17T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is unsustainable, and we now have peer-reviewed proof", "text": "By Cale Guthrie Weissman 1 minute Read\nAll the techno-utopians who claim that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the decentralized financial future seem to neglect the physical toll this technology has on the very world we live in. It’s not necessarily a new finding that bitcoin mining uses a ton of energy , but yesterday we saw the first peer-reviewed study that confirmed just that. What’s more, the environmental toll is about to get worse.\nAccording to this study by economist Alex de Vries, which was reported in Grist , bitcoin’s energy usage is expected to double by the end of this year –which would represent an energy footprint roughly equal to that of the Netherlands. Already, according to the paper , current bitcoin usage represents nearly the energy output of Ireland.\nAs blockchain becomes more normalized, this insane energy footprint will only grow. De Vries foresees a near future where bitcoin consumes as much a 5% of the world’s energy.\nWhile these conclusions aren’t new–de Vries has been speaking out about this issue for quite some time now–this is the first time the scientific community has backed up his claims. Hopefully, this could begin a wakeup call for the blockchain community. As we wrote last year , there are some fixes we could begin implementing now to mitigate the damage.\nThe first step, however, is getting people to understand what the future damage could be. Let’s hope they realize the environmental toll before it’s too late.

it will have a native currency,” Dorsey, the chief executive officer of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., said Wednesday at Consensus, a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in New York City. “I don’t know if it’ll be Bitcoin or not,” he said, but “I hope it will be.”\nThis wasn’t the first time Dorsey had spoken fondly of digital currencies. The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nNot everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move.\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\nRead more: Snoop Dogg, Dorsey bring crypto to masses during blockchain week\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,” Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s “Blockchain Week.” “We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.” SHARE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "twitter inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:13:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8598daa01dd46b1c8a1f0416088b6958f6bb953f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJtRbkgKgWa9__pIXMkxtRfnxZHN6xqELwBdNaXuyMIlFvJEchnvMK71ezenCOlhBv5pvVpGi.ckZ6j5bR4bgP01pJUmZXuGgGuTTk8JagWTS96VASrexD1Gj8A4ByWW6qAzjYqefuQQJ6tTq_v4dMhW_JFMfiU6qGSJIGo8v.lg--", "site_full": "ibsintelligence.com", "site": "ibsintelligence.com", "site_section": "https://ibsintelligence.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "finance"], "section_title": "IBS Intelligence", "title": "Chinese government gives thumbs up to Ethereum in crypto rankings, puts Bitcoin 13th", "title_full": "Chinese government gives thumbs up to Ethereum in crypto rankings, puts Bitcoin 13th", "published": "2018-05-17T16:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://32thcv3s4g2f4bru3o3jkumf-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ethereum-Square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8598daa01dd46b1c8a1f0416088b6958f6bb953f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJtRbkgKgWa9__pIXMkxtRfnxZHN6xqELwBdNaXuyMIlFvJEchnvMK71ezenCOlhBv5pvVpGi.ckZ6j5bR4bgP01pJUmZXuGgGuTTk8JagWTS96VASrexD1Gj8A4ByWW6qAzjYqefuQQJ6tTq_v4dMhW_JFMfiU6qGSJIGo8v.lg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alex Hamilton", "published": "2018-05-17T16:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chinese government gives thumbs up to Ethereum in crypto rankings, puts Bitcoin 13th", "text": "Chinese government gives thumbs up to Ethereum in crypto rankings, puts Bitcoin 13th May 17 2018\nThe China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has published the first in a series of technology assessments centred on cryptocurrency and blockchain.\nThe Global Public Chain Technology Assessment Index, besides being the third long-winded name used in this story, ranked different cryptocurrencies by their “applicability”, “creativity” an underlying infrastructure.

I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don’t think we are ready. So I’m still paying attention to Alipay … to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.”\nLast year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln. The overwhelmingly popular mobile payment app Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, reportedly has 450 mln users.\nAs early as summer 2016, Ant Financial, introduced blockchain technology to improve accountability in its work with the Chinese charity industry, going on to recruit blockchain experts in the company at large the following year.\nHowever, in line with Ma’s position, Alibaba Group has stopped short of embracing cryptocurrencies, with Alibaba Cloud recently denying rumours its newly launched ‘P2P Nodes’ network was a cryptocurrency mining platform. Later, in April, Alibaba subsidiary Taobao banned all ICO-related advertising from its platform.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://uk.businessinsider.com/alibabas-revenue-soaring-despite-costly-investments-2018-5?r=US&IR=T", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/alibabas-taobao-expands-crypto-regulations-by-banning-icos-and-associated-services", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-revolution-is-on-alibaba-to-make-donations-trackable", "http://www.8btc.com/mayun-bitcoin-is-bubble", "https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/alipay-first-data-us-point-of-sale-expansion/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-alibaba-says-new-p2p-platform-is-not-crypto-related", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/alibaba", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-09/asia-s-richest-man-sees-net-worth-soar-2-8-billion-in-a-day?cmpid=socialflow-facebook-markets&utm_content=markets&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-chinas-60-billion-alipay-is-recruiting-blockchain-engineers-experts", "https://global.alipay.com/", "http://www.wicongress.org/en"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "e-commerce giant alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tianjin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:00:52.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebf6c90d454de47c6b9787f9ad8cbadbc36ad4ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfrtanJoj4rl2yTam50C1UM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "What is the real purpose of the Bitcoin especially in this new era?", "title_full": "What is the real purpose of the Bitcoin especially in this new era?", "published": "2018-05-17T16:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.419, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebf6c90d454de47c6b9787f9ad8cbadbc36ad4ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfrtanJoj4rl2yTam50C1UM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "torch2121", "published": "2018-05-17T16:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the real purpose of the Bitcoin especially in this new era?", "text": "I think the real purpose of Bitcoin is a mystery.

Although the block size increase is quite a feat, BCH developers have also expanded the network’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some old Satoshi OP_Codes that were previously removed from earlier codebases. Now over the past 24-hours, lots of people have been playing around with the new BCH features. Also Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features Experimenting With the New Bitcoin Cash OP_Codes Lots of BCH community members have been discussing the new OP_Code features and the additional space added to the network’s default data-carrier-size. The first signs of people messing around with the new features came from the Memo and Blockpress developers as both platform’s increased posting character limit from 79 to 217. Both Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters. This means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain. Then shortly after the fork, another OP_Code feature was shown to the community by Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia. The First Tree Signature on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain Pacia built the first tree signature on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain by utilizing the OP_CAT functionality — which creates a more efficient multi-signature combination. The Openbazaar programmer explains for addresses with a large number of keys, a tree signature can use less data. “For addresses with a large number of keys a tree signature can use less data. And unlike normal OP_CHECKMULTISIG, it doesn’t require you to expose the keys that were not used in the signing,” Pacia explains to the BCH community on May 15. Moreover, Pacia shows his demonstration via a block explorer URL which indicates it was a 1 of 8 multi-sig tree signature. Chris Pacia’s multi-sig tree. Many individuals were very impressed with the new multi-sig operation that shows innovation in multi-signature technology, and one that could add more BCH privacy in the future. Pacia details his example is a subset of MAST — which stands for ‘Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees.’ MAST could improve BCH privacy because certain multi-sig scripts could be kept hidden. “This is like a subset of MAST,” Pacia explains. MAST is more general but can’t be done with the current opcodes as far as I know — If we had OP_EVAL then we could I think. An OP_Code Puzzle With a Message in the Script After the tree signature our Chief Technology Officer, Emil Oldenburg, also experimented with the Satoshi OP_Codes and created a ‘transaction puzzle.’ When the puzzle is solved it contains a secret message within the hashed script. “I made a fun little transaction puzzle with one of the new OP_Codes,” Oldenburg explains . The puzzle is solved with the string “BCH is the best Bitcoin”. The script is <String1><String2> OP_XOR OP_HASH256 <hash1> OP_EQUAL. It’s solved by finding the secret String1 that when XORed with String2, after hashing should be equal to hash1. Etching the Bible’s 23,000 Verses Into the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain Lastly, another anonymous user is pushing the ‘arbitrary data spam debate’ to the ultimate level. The Twitter handle UK Cryptocurrency showed the cryptocurrency community that a BCH address is currently writing the first testament of the King James Bible to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain at 1sat/Byte. Looking at the Bitcoin Cash transaction ID its Memo states: 1 In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. Transactions following this continue to be written in the BCH chain with each verse that’s found in the King James Bible. This address is etching the entire Bible into the blockchain. UK Cryptocurrency estimates that the entire Bible may cost around $100 USD (0.08 BCH) and add around 8MB to the BCH chain. Of course, many Bitcoin Cash fans were excited to see the many OP_Code developments unfold so fast and expect more innovative ideas will sprout down the line. What do you think about all the OP_Code experimentation over the past day? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.

Bitcoin Price Drop Slows As Crypto Market Takes A Breather Investing , News | May 17, 2018 By: Bruce Haring\nBitcoin’s race toward the bottom slowed today at the $8,200 per single coin level, as investor panic is apparently cooling. The rest of the cryptocurrency markets followed, with some upward corrections on EOS (up more than five percent) and Cardano (up more than one percent) post gains at mid-morning.\nIs this the end of the panic caused by the raid on Korea’s largest exchange? Authorities there have apparently found no wrongdoing in the exchange’s operation, which is news that should come as welcome relief to investors. Still, there’s a steep curve to climb back toward pre-panic heights.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending May 17, 2018 at 1:15 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $8,562.53 on the Simex exchange at 11:24 pm yesterday. Simex saw $47,982,300 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $8,232.51 on Huobi’s exchange at 4:00 am today. Huobi’s 24 hour volume was $110,986,000.\nThe average price on the surveyed exchanges, as weighed by volume, was $8,321.01.\nVolatility was lower than average, with the BlockTribune Volatility Index coming in at 38.5. A higher number indicates greater price volatility with 50 describing an average day.\nThese statistics were consolidated from 10 different exchanges.

It must be a solution to data privacy in the data age,\" Ma said. “It has to provide value before it can become wealth.”\nAlibaba has long studied blockchain and currently has the most blockchain patents in the world. “Alibaba will die if there is no blockchain,” Ma reportedly said.\nAlibaba's co-founder realized the importance of blockchain technology when he heard that it could solve the problem of data privacy security before he understood it, Ma said. Alibaba has been working on blockchain for years, but it has no intention to deal with Bitcoin, he repetaed.\nIf the blockchain technology moves forward in a down-to-earth manner, it will definitely bring value, Ma said. “But now everyone eyes blockchain and there are even people who buy and sell blockchains. It concerns me,” he added.\nMa gave a fun example to show how popular blockchain now is. He said an engineer from Ant Financial Services Group, financial affiliate of Alibaba, received more than 300 courtship letters soon after he posted his job as a blockchain engineer on a matchmaking website.\nIt is possible to turn blockchain into wealth if it is to be seen as something that creates value for the society, Ma said. But many people now regard blockchain as something that will help make money in the future and then come to an end.\nEditor: Mevlut Katik", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack ma tang shihua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack ma  jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world intelligent congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba group holding ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tianjin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:31:35.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a09fc29784c0e0402c5373478dc725cd67b9bbb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQsQ._dQyosFK2SA1cPmqK0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What's the Real Value of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "What's the Real Value of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-17T16:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a09fc29784c0e0402c5373478dc725cd67b9bbb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQsQ._dQyosFK2SA1cPmqK0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "schwarzone", "published": "2018-05-17T16:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "What's the Real Value of Bitcoin?", "text": "What is a Fair Price for Bitcoin?

Seberapa banyak jaringan listrik Bitcoin yang digunakan? Untuk menjawab hal tersebut, diperlukan pemahaman untuk menerapkan kebijakan dan tetap menjadi tantangan.\nDalam jurnal Joule, artikel kuantifikasi Bitcoin dalam kebutuhan energi, sebuah komentar muncul 16 Mei dari ahli ekonom keuangan dan spesialis blockchain Alex de Vries, dirinya menggunakan sebuah metodologi baru untuk menentukan konsumsi listrik yang dihasilkan oleh Bitcoin.\nKami telah melihat banyak perhitungan, tetapi kita perlu lebih banyak diskusi ilmiah dimana jaringan ini dipimpin. Sekarang, informasi yang tersedia secara keseluruhan masih sedikit, jadi saya berharap bahwa orang akan menggunakan kertas ini sebagai dasar untuk penelitian lebih lanjut, kata de Vries, yang bekerja di pusat PwC dan pendiri Digiconomist.\nPerkiraannya, menempatkan minimal penggunaan saat ini dengan jaringan Bitcoin di 2.55 gigawatts, yang berarti menggunakan hampir sebagian listrik di Irlandia. Pada akhir tahun ini, ia memprediksi jaringan tersebut dapat menggunakan sebanyak 7.7 gigawatts atau setengah persen dari total konsumsi di dunia.\nBagi saya, setengah persen sudah cukup mengejutkan. Perbedaan ekstrim dibandingkan dengan sistem keuangan yang teratur, dan permintaan listrik yang meningkat ini pasti tidak akan membantu kita dalam mencapai tujuan iklim kita, katanya.\nJika harga Bitcoin terus meningkat seperti yang diprediksi beberapa ahli, de Vries meramalkan suatu hari nanti bisa mengkonsumsi 5% dari dunia listrik. Itu akan cukup buruk.\nKetergantungan Bitcoin bergantung pada komputer dalam waktu transaksi kepada jaringan yang berkelanjutan untuk mencegah duplikat pengeluaran koin. Jaringan computer melakukan perhitungan secara terus menerus, bersaing untuk kesempatan, setiap sepuluh menit menjadi blok transaksi berikutnya. Kesemuanya sudah diatur seperti dalam rantai.\nAnda menghasilkan angka-angka sepanjang waktu dan mesin-mesin yang Anda gunakan dengan menggunakan listrik. Tetapi jika Anda ingin mendapatkan sepotong besar kue, Anda perlu untuk meningkatkan daya komputasi. Jadi ada insentif yang besar bagi setiap orang untuk meningkatkan berapa banyak mereka menghabiskan pada listrik dan mesin, kata de Vries.\nDe Vries juga menunjukkan bahwa ada banyak ruang untuk diskusi tentang metode tersebut.\nSaya pikir semua orang setuju pada konsumsi energi minimum.

Kita benar-benar tidak memiliki pendekatan umum untuk mendapatkan perkiraan yang masa depan konsumsi listrik sekarang, itulah sebabnya saya berharap untuk mendapatkan percakapan ini dimulai.

However, he also points out a few things that need to happen before that.\nIn an interview for CNBC, the chairman of the popular investment company, CoinShares, stood firm that Bitcoin’s price will surge once again in a manner similar to the one in 2017. Yet, he outlines that there are two things that need to happen before that – better structuring as well as a comprehensive life cycle after Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Enhanced Structure – What Does it Mean?\nAs for the first premise for a potential Bitcoin price surge, Masters outlines that the structure of cryptocurrencies has to continue to build. In his words:\nWe need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build, […] We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.\nWith this, Masters hints that there are plenty of ways for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go prior to reaching a state of maturity. In other words, the field is still in a rather early stage of its life cycle. To build on to that point, the Chairman of CoinShares says:\nWe’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet.\nA lot of things have to come together to solidify the structure of cryptocurrencies. For one, clear regulations have to be laid down. Cryptocurrencies need to be defined. Governments across the world seem to be torn in the way they see them. While some countries like Thailand have already stepped forward to regulate cryptocurrencies as digital assets, others are still to take serious legislative actions. ICOs – An Important Part\nMasters also stressed the importance of ICOs, and, most importantly, the way they turn out after the fundraising event is finished:\nWe need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle, […] And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\nThe statements do have a lot of merit behind them. As it turns out, almost half of the ICOs didn’t have any development work done before the ICO itself. What is more, it also seems that the post ICO performance is also poor due to the lack of value of the assets which are being sold. In other words, the tokens people are investing in are not really needed for the system, as noted by a study from ICORating .\nWith such improvements in the cryptocurrency sphere showing that the space is maturing, Masters believes that a rally in the price of Bitcoin will happen.\nDo you think that we’ll see a surge in Bitcoin price like we did in late 2017?

The international body also wants to help governments of member-states develop and implement legislation aimed at protecting consumer rights in electronic trade.\nAccording to Elina Sidorenko, head of Russia’s interdepartmental group working to assess risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies, the OECD will be used as a platform to discuss matters related to cryptos and token sales. These discussions will be held in the context of ensuring the safety of consumers of financial services, she said in a post on her Telegram channel.\nThe OECD and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) recognize the role of cryptocurrency as a means of payment and accumulation, Sidorenko emphasized. Both organizations also view ICOs as a good mechanism to attract funding, she added. “I hope that the generally positive rhetoric on cryptocurrencies in the OECD will not change,” the Russian official said, promising to keep her followers informed on further developments. Astana Calls for UN Crypto Rules\nKazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev thinks that the time has come to adopt common, international rules on cryptocurrencies with the help of the United Nations. “Most countries are actively exploring the possibility to adapt their regulations to the current configuration of the financial system. At the same time, the disconnected actions of different states will lead to inefficiency. It is necessary to develop general rules,” he insisted, quoted by Zakon.kz .\nDuring the Astana Economic Forum, Nazarbayev noted that Kazakhstan’s own project to issue an assets-backed cryptocurrency called G-Global has won institutional support from international organizations. The initiative “has been mentioned on multiple occasions during the G20 summit. Last week the Council of Foreign Ministers at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes more than 50 nations, adopted a resolution to support it,” the president revealed.\nKazakhstani officials have previously said that G-Global will be designed as a crypto “backed by assets, not just trust.” These assets have not been specified so far but the Central Asian country is rich in natural resources. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the region, generating 60% of its GDP, primarily through the oil and natural gas industry.\nRecent reports that Kazakhstan’s central bank is preparing legislation to ban the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies, as well as crypto mining, have been dismissed by representatives of the local crypto community. According to Leonid Muravjov, VP at the Blockchain and Crypto Technology Association of Kazakhstan, the government is actually spending huge amounts of money to digitize the economy, which is currently heavily reliant on the export of mineral resources. Kazakhstan and Belarus to Cooperate on Blockchain\nAstana and Minsk intend to strengthen their ties in the field of blockchain implementation. Kazakhstan and Belarus have signed a memorandum of cooperation that will allow experts from the two former Soviet republics to exchange experience and improve their competitiveness on the world stage through wider adoption of new technologies. Both countries are members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).\n“The bottom line is that this (blockchain) is a multinational technology, and the development of some real solutions, both at state level and in the private sector, does not make sense in the context of a single state. The memorandum aims to develop the most optimal solutions through exchange of experience and personnel, and to share already working solutions based on blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies,” said Stanislav Baskov, Director of the Belarussian Distributed Ledger Technologies Association.\nAccording to a press release by Astana Hub, Kazakhstan’s IT Park, the agreement was signed during the international expo TIBO – 2018 in Belarus. It would allow Kazakhstan to take advantage of the Belarusian experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency integration. Recently, Minsk legalized crypto-related activities for entities registered with its Hi-Tech Park with a presidential decree that came into force on March 28. Iran and Russia to Create Crypto Alternative to SWIFT\nRecognizing the opportunity to minimize dependence on the US dollar, Iranian authorities have turned their attention to cryptocurrencies. Iran’s central bank has commenced work on proposals to use cryptocurrency in international trade, as requested by the parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs, Interfax reported.\n“Cryptocurrencies offer a good opportunity to circumvent the use of the dollar, and also replace the SWIFT system,” said Mohamad Reza Purebrahimi, who heads the commission. Teheran has established cooperation with Russia on the matter following a meeting with the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, Dmitriy Mezentsev. Purebrahimi said that the two countries may be the first to use cryptocurrency in bilateral trade transactions.\n“Against the backdrop of US pressure, the expansion of settlements in national currencies, as well as the possible use of payment systems like [the Russian] Mir and the Iranian Shetab is promising,” Mezentsev commented.

However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n“We have seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need a more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I am hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based on economics, puts the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of 2018, he predicts that the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts— as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five percent of the world’s electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent the duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as ‘mining’ Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power.\n“You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you are using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there is a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vriess estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine is equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.

Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, has officially submitted a listing application to Asia’s third-largest equities market – the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nAlso Read: HTC to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency-Focused Smartphone, Exodus $1 Billion IPO\nCanaan posted a preliminary prospectus on Tuesday revealing it brought in a revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2017 and that its net income jumped over 600% to 361 million yuan. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are named as joint sponsors of the proposed offering in the preliminary prospectus. The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion.\nThe Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now. Canaan to HK\nThe Hong Kong market wasn’t the company’s only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn’t explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision.\nBack in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies “while you sleep.” Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.\nShould all stock investors add an ASIC producer to their portfolio to get exposure to the bitcoin market?

Steem is a content distribution platform based on the blockchain with a primary purpose of distributing content. Essentially, Steem is like Reddit based on the decentralized blockchain. Another surprising addition to its top 10 rankings was Monero at number 9, given that several governments including the Japanese government and its financial services agency (FSA) have expressed their concerns towards cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash that are capable of processing anonymous payments that could be associated with money laundering and criminal activities. The cryptocurrency community was taken aback by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, which was co-ranked with privacy-focused cryptocurrency Verge. The bitcoin community was understandably outraged by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, considering that bitcoin has the longest track record as the most secure and dominant cryptocurrency in the global market. The argument that bitcoin’s application is limited to a form of money and payment is illogical, as the Chinese government ranked Steem, which has a single application on its blockchain network that is a content distribution platform, as the 2nd best blockchain network behind Steem. More importantly, bitcoin has one of the most active open source development communities in the global cryptocurrency sector and it has developed innovative technologies like Confidential Transactions (CT), Bulletproofs, and Lightning Network, which allows developers to enable private transactions, process micro-payments, and with solutions like RootStock, potentially allow bitcoin to function as an Ethereum-like smart contracts platform. Exceeded Expectations The majority of the cryptocurrency community expected the Chinese government to rank private blockchain networks and protocols that can assist the government in surveillance or monitoring transactions at the top. Hence, the ranking of the government which placed cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Monero demonstrate the intent of the government to remain objective in its assessment. However, analysts have stated that the Chinese government has overlooked the long track record, hashrate, computing power, and accumulated difficulty of major blockchain networks like bitcoin and prioritized next-generation blockchain networks instead. Earlier this month, South China Morning Post, a major publication based in Hong Kong, reported that China’s public blockchain rankings were developed by China Center for Information Industry Development (CIID), an institute that works closely with the government to advise on policymaking in technology.\nThe high ranking of Ethereum and smart contract blockchain networks could influence the government to potentially allow some blockchain networks to operate in China. https://www.ccn.com/china-ranks-ethereum-as-the-worlds-best-blockchain-network-bitcoin-at-13/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccid research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry & information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "komodo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:34:40.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d6a8f2b7904872dc1e76cbe71747b33f6c0c240", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdLTAgLP2_insevhtKhd6b0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-17T15:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d6a8f2b7904872dc1e76cbe71747b33f6c0c240", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdLTAgLP2_insevhtKhd6b0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jporter80", "published": "2018-05-17T15:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "For me,you should invest on your capabilities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T11:24:53.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e92f534dc3748ab6eb6cd7c32ffe1dbb48dee537", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBMeWha09CrS1PgpiAqrNlH", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Why do people hate Bitcoin Cash? >Fastest transact", "title_full": "/biz/ - Why do people hate Bitcoin Cash? >Fastest transact - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-17T15:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 209, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e92f534dc3748ab6eb6cd7c32ffe1dbb48dee537", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBMeWha09CrS1PgpiAqrNlH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-17T15:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do people hate Bitcoin Cash? >Fastest transact", "text": "Why do people hate Bitcoin Cash?\n>Fastest transactions (instant)\n>Very Low fees\n>Smart Contracts\n>Working scaling solution proved by scientific and technological studies\n>Supported by Gavin Andreson (based lad)\n>It literally works RIGHT NOW.\n>Very easy to use\n>Widely Recognised by pretty much all crypto institutions, and a CNBC favourite (which is important to normies)\n/r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.com (controlled by the same guy) have a massive censorship and shilling campaign against it, but desu thats probably a reason to like it more.\n>But I dont like muh roger ver\nGreg maxwell is a fat neckbeard and the rest of the blockstream team are part of the \"magical crypto friends\".

Regardless of the criticisms, Tezos' ICO is proof that token crowdsales are still incredibly scorching, each for merchants looking to earn a fast buck by flipping new tokens and for crypto-related startups looking to get funded. However, while IPOs take care of investors, ICOs take care of supporters which might be keen to purchase a model-new job very similar to a crowdfunding occasion. Because of this, most ICOs nowadays are Ethereum-based, and to participate in the sale, you generally must trade your ETH for tokens.When a cryptocurrency startup firm needs to mining lift cash by a Preliminary Coin Offering (ICO), it often develops an intend on a whitepaper which mentions precisely what the mission has to do with, what want( s) the task will meet upon completion, what does it price? While ICOs use voting mechanisms in the precise platform (i.e. Aragon), others like CryptoTask mining neo at e-chat use voting to control the discharge of funds in phases publish-ICO. Whereas there have been loads of success echat for mining tales, in the 2nd quarter of final year, an Ethereum based mostly challenge named The DAO entered an ICO to launch an investment fund with no fund manager, with the investors being concerned in all the funding choices upon launch. Gross sales of cash or tokens are direct, together with multiple rounds, with few if any intermediaries required within the course of, buyers basing funding decisions on the content material of white papers prepared by the [empty] fund raising entity. Bitcoin and different digital currencies are primarily based on blockchains—cryptographic ledgers that report every transaction carried out utilizing Bitcoin tokens (see Why Bitcoin Might Be A lot Extra Than a Forex \"). Individual computer systems all over the world, linked through the Web, verify every transaction utilizing open-source software. It is considerably just like an Initial Public Providing ( IPO ) in which investors buy shares of an organization. Essentially the most profitable ICO so far has been Ethereum, the smart contract platform. ICOs imply the creation of a brand new devoted token for the undertaking. IPO refers to the public sale of the shares of a company for the first time, with the aim of gathering funds for enterprise enlargement and improvement. An example of a successful ICO undertaking that paid to early traders is the intelligent contracts platform known as Ethereum which has Ethers as its coin tokens. Every ICO is slightly bit completely different, however often there is a time restrict for the sale, and a set variety of most tokens that will be provided. Some ICOs supply bare-bone cash which do not incorporate any rights. That's because Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency, it is a platform for intelligent contracts that makes ICOs easier to do (although, theoretically, you can have a token sale on a various platform; for example, Ethereum itself had a Bitcoin-primarily based token sale in 2014, raising $18 million). Studying find out how to determine if an organization's Initial Coin Providing (ICO) is legit can be a helpful talent to develop previous to deciding in your crypto-investment technique. Some initiatives just launch their tokens hours after the ICO has ended. Not like the bitcoin onerous fork that seemed to garner a lot media traction, Ethereum's hard fork has not been as extensively discussed. Of course, the interest might wane in the coming days, and the ultimate amount Tezos will increase depends on the highly unstable Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies. Moreover, when Ethereum's protocol is upgraded to permit for tokens to be the gas that pushes transactions through the network, the SNGLS token will obtain absolute utility and better value. Though there are profitable ICO offers on document and ICOs are poised to be disruptive innovative instruments in the digital age, financiers are cautioned to be cautious as some ICO or crowdsale initiatives are actually deceptive. The best method to consider the difference between a token and a coin is that coins are peer to peer and have their very own Blockchain (like Bitcoin itself) whereas tokens rest on high of one other Blockchain (like Golem is on Ethereum). CVA is a Swiss-primarily based not-for-profit association supporting the development of blockchain and cryptographic associated applied sciences and businesses, revealed a collection of codes of conduct to foster good apply, and produce clarity and confidence towards a new, rapidly-growing asset class.\" Comparatively, as noted by Ian Simpson , head of promoting and communications at Lakeside Companions (an early-stage funding agency in Zug, Switzerland) the country's authorized and political system mirrors the rules within blockchain, because the Swiss cantonal system consists of 26 semi-autonomous regions with a rotating federal presidency.

Escrow wallets maintain funds until the promised services or products is completed and the developer starts distributing the crypto foreign money and the coins turn into accessible on the market and alternate. Secondary market buying and selling of virtual tokens or cash can also occur on an alternate. So if you happen to have been to buy into an ICO of a promising young company, you would trade your Bitcoin or Ethereum (each relatively established cryptocurrencies) for brand spanking new cash the corporate had simply created. Some promoters and preliminary sellers might lead consumers of the digital coins or tokens to expect a return on their funding or to participate in a share of the returns supplied by the mining venture. You can decide to maintain them or trade them again into ETH at any level; quite a lot of ICO participants rapidly flip\" the tokens again into ETH, particularly if the tokens rapidly get value compared to the ICO worth.

But Dorsey argues that the Internet will eventually move to a currency standard that every person and company would ostensibly use to facilitate transactions.\n“Let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” Dorsey said.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nActually getting to a currency standard would likely take significant work and time. While Bitcoin is the most well known of cryptocurrencies, there are several others that have strong backing from the Internet community. And it’s nearly a guarantee that other big companies, like Apple , Google , and Amazon might have something to say about a future Internet currency standard before it’s ever chosen.\nFor his part, Dorsey has been one of the more outspoken proponents of Bitcoin and digital currencies. His digital payment company Square allows for Bitcoin transactions and the company actively buys and sells the digital currency.\nAnd by the sound of his comments, it doesn’t appear Dorsey is letting up on that support anytime soon.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been Quote: d in the media recently.In their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the “Oracle of Omaha” has a general distaste for bitcoin.\nFor those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as “rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual shareholder meeting.\nThe Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets\nOne of the key counterarguments to Buffett’s assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna.\n“Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven’t taken the time to really understand what’s going on here,” said Wilson. “If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you’ll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn’t exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we’re going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.”\nThe LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the “Web 2.0” phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed “Web 3.0.”\nThis Is Very Different From Buffett’s World\nWilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett’s approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains.\nTalking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them.\n“The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,” said Wilson.\nIn short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market.\n“There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we’ve ever seen,” Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem.\nWhile Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved.\nAdditionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine. 👓 View full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.onenewspage.com/n/Markets/1zj7zezasc/Fred-Wilson-Explains-Why-Warren-Buffett-Doesn.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett christine lagarde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:59:39.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fffe42fcd94e9c2d16bb0e97d93d6ac744b8fe0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.svLVUcHwBfX0AgyW8wcAuqPRsbZc3A8JXn1IIqWzmUfJ5YMSxvj6gZl.iB_ho0X9MIfoBnIwh_k7", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Florida County to Allow Citizens to Pay for Government Services with Bitcoin", "title_full": "Florida County to Allow Citizens to Pay for Government Services with Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T15:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fffe42fcd94e9c2d16bb0e97d93d6ac744b8fe0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.svLVUcHwBfX0AgyW8wcAuqPRsbZc3A8JXn1IIqWzmUfJ5YMSxvj6gZl.iB_ho0X9MIfoBnIwh_k7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T15:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Florida County to Allow Citizens to Pay for Government Services with Bitcoin", "text": "Florida County to Allow Citizens to Pay for Government Services with Bitcoin\n/u/sinonimboga\nsubmitted by /u/sinonimboga\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "allow citizens to pay for government services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:17:30.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38f01712ada9c89b7485a98c5be73db57d2c6b3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhAPOaNcj0kEfsgnL3CZ1c38-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert -

The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development is looking into the possible uses of digital coins and the associated technologies. Kazakhstan is calling for the adoption of common crypto rules by the United Nations, while Iran and Russia are thinking about using cryptocurrency in bilateral trade.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu\nOECD Explores Cryptos and ICOs The Committee on Digital Economy at the Organization of Economic Development and Cooperation ( OECD ) has started exploring blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The international body also wants to help governments of member-states develop and implement legislation aimed at protecting consumer rights in electronic trade.\nAccording to Elina Sidorenko, head of Russia's interdepartmental group working to assess risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies, the OECD will be used as a platform to discuss matters related to cryptos and token sales. These discussions will be held in the context of ensuring the safety of consumers of financial services, she said in a post on her Telegram channel .\nThe OECD and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) recognize the role of cryptocurrency as a means of payment and accumulation, Sidorenko emphasized. Both organizations also view ICOs as a good mechanism to attract funding, she added. \"I hope that the generally positive rhetoric on cryptocurrencies in the OECD will not change,\" the Russian official said, promising to keep her followers informed on further developments.\nAstana Calls for UN Crypto Rules Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev thinks that the time has come to adopt common, international rules on cryptocurrencies with the help of the United Nations. \"Most countries are actively exploring the possibility to adapt their regulations to the current configuration of the financial system. At the same time, the disconnected actions of different states will lead to inefficiency. It is necessary to develop general rules,\" he insisted, quoted by Zakon.kz .\nDuring the Astana Economic Forum, Nazarbayev noted that Kazakhstan's own project to issue an assets-backed cryptocurrency called G-Global has won institutional support from international organizations. The initiative \"has been mentioned on multiple occasions during the G20 summit . Last week the Council of Foreign Ministers at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes more than 50 nations, adopted a resolution to support it,\" the president revealed.\nKazakhstani officials have previously said that G-Global will be designed as a crypto \"backed by assets, not just trust.\" These assets have not been specified so far but the Central Asian country is rich in natural resources. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the region , generating 60% of its GDP, primarily through the oil and natural gas industry.\nRecent reports that Kazakhstan's central bank is preparing legislation to ban the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies, as well as crypto mining, have been dismissed by representatives of the local crypto community. According to Leonid Muravjov, VP at the Blockchain and Crypto Technology Association of Kazakhstan, the government is actually spending huge amounts of money to digitize the economy, which is currently heavily reliant on the export of mineral resources.\nKazakhstan and Belarus to Cooperate on Blockchain Astana and Minsk intend to strengthen their ties in the field of blockchain implementation. Kazakhstan and Belarus have signed a memorandum of cooperation that will allow experts from the two former Soviet republics to exchange experience and improve their competitiveness on the world stage through wider adoption of new technologies. Both countries are members of the Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU ).\n\"The bottom line is that this (blockchain) is a multinational technology, and the development of some real solutions, both at state level and in the private sector, does not make sense in the context of a single state. The memorandum aims to develop the most optimal solutions through exchange of experience and personnel, and to share already working solutions based on blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies,\" said Stanislav Baskov, Director of the Belarussian Distributed Ledger Technologies Association.\nAccording to a press release by Astana Hub , Kazakhstan's IT Park, the agreement was signed during the international expo TIBO – 2018 in Belarus. It would allow Kazakhstan to take advantage of the Belarusian experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency integration. Recently, Minsk legalized crypto-related activities for entities registered with its Hi-Tech Park with a presidential decree that came into force on March 28.\nIran and Russia to Create Crypto Alternative to SWIFT Recognizing the opportunity to minimize dependence on the US dollar, Iranian authorities have turned their attention to cryptocurrencies. Iran's central bank has commenced work on proposals to use cryptocurrency in international trade, as requested by the parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs, Interfax reported.\n\"Cryptocurrencies offer a good opportunity to circumvent the use of the dollar, and also replace the SWIFT system,\" said Mohamad Reza Purebrahimi, who heads the commission. Teheran has established cooperation with Russia on the matter following a meeting with the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the upper house of Russia's parliament, Dmitriy Mezentsev. Purebrahimi said that the two countries may be the first to use cryptocurrency in bilateral trade transactions.\n\"Against the backdrop of US pressure, the expansion of settlements in national currencies, as well as the possible use of payment systems like [the Russian] Mir and the Iranian Shetab is promising,\" Mezentsev commented. According to official sources quoted in Moscow, Russia may put its version of SWIFT, the SPFS , on blockchain as early as next year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the highlights in today's Bitcoin in Brief?
