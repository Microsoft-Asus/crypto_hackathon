Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future.\nThe Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy.\nFintech Revolution The number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people.\nPrice Resilience Bitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines.

With the BitPay method however, there is both a reduction in cost alongside an increase in efficiency.\nWith a step towards digitization, Greenberg believes this will be beneficial to every stakeholder involved.\n“The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18 th century into the 21 st century,” he commented.\n“The expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government”\nBitPay, founded in 2011, claims it is safer than traditional payment methods due to the verification and recorded nature of the transaction. It argues that traditional credit card fraud is eliminated alongside identity theft risks.\nThe payment system is not limited to consumer wallets – it enables businesses to send and receive across borders.\n“We recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure and less expensive on a global scale,” said Jermie Beaudry, head of compliance at BitPay.\n“We have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them,” the company said.\nDistributed ledger technology, the system behind BitPay, functions using an open, online spreadsheet. Blockchain technology means that when the transaction has been reported within this ledger, it cannot be altered.\nBitPay has offices in North America, Europe, South America and has raised over $70m from leading investors.

In this article, Smart Contracts are defined as a specific code to complement or completely replace customary legal contracts. Basically, Smart Contracts are the contracts on which terms are encoded in computer language instead of legal language. Up until now, the Smart Contract code has been fully supported by Ethereum, but never Bitcoin. The issue is closed We live in a great era; we are amazed by electric cars in the cosmos and robots with a sense of touch, but the issue of Bitcoin Smart Contracts was still hanging in the air until now. April 2018 has finally brought the solution to the riddle of a mysterious blockchain code that couldn’t find a sophisticated method use. Who is responsible for this? This was made possible by 2 innovative blockchain platforms: RSK and MyWish. RSK is the first general purpose Smart Contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network. RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency. A 2-Way Peg between Bitcoin blockchain and RSK blockchain ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC. (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). MyWish is a full-cycle, decentralized Smart Contract platform with the following uses: Smart Contract creation, Audit, Deployment, Systematic calling on schedule, Execution. How it works The MyWish platform makes it affordable for everyone who wants to create a Smart Contract based on Bitcoin. RSK network is the platform to run MyWish Smart Contracts. This platform is in charge of converting Bitcoins in SmartBTC to make any transaction possible; mind that you will withdraw your invested Bitcoins in the end. SmartBTC is needed to break the code of BTC, which makes the creation of Smart Contract 98% impossible. The first launched Bitcoin Smart Contract is dedicated to the last will and testament. Any person who holds their cryptocurrency investments in the form of Bitcoin could transfer savings to their family or friends in the event of their sudden illness or death. Due to the fact that security and reliability are 2 components that the independent world of Blockchain is missing, these two (MyWish platform and RSK platform) teams found the most trustworthy solution in response to that. A Smart Contract secures your assets no matter what. The original terms of Smart Contracts can’t be changed by anybody but the owner. What else to expect As Smart Contracts bring stability and security, the demand increases more and more every day. In the near future Bitcoin Smart Contracts will cover almost every single aspect of life so that cryptocurrency becomes part of the mainstream. They are there when you want them to protect you. See you soon and forever The world’s first Bitcoin Smart Contracts are supported by RSK network and offered in an easy-to-use way by MyWish. MyWish and RSK platforms that offer customer support and willingly assist their clients in facing the future with reliable cryptocurrency transactions. * For more information regarding media usage, ownership and rights please contact MyWish.

Litecoin has contributed a lot to Bitcoin as well, and in no small part due to the good relationships between the devs. Bitcoin may never have needed all that Lightning Network and atomic swap testing on Litecoin but I'm sure every success Litecoin's ever had was only good learning steps for Bitcoin.\nAnyone can make a crypto... that's actually part of the beauty of Bitcoin. You're free to do as you wish with the code. Free to improve on it, change it, attempt to create your own value on it. Hundreds have tried, hundreds will continue to try. Whether they are successful or not doesn't matter. What matters is that they CAN try. How did something so amazing become something so negative?\nOh, I wasn't saying Litecoin is bad. I like it, actually. I was simply making fun of its redundancy, having basically the same roadmap as Bitcoin, and its meme reputation as a testnet. It's a great alternative and I would hold it before ETH or any other altcoin, but I also believe that people won't need alternatives that do pretty much the exact same things Bitcoin does at some point in the future. People are completely free to create coins, fork, and use open source code, and are likewise free to call anything they want shit.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com.\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=BTC&destCurr=USD", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/gertrude-chavez-dreyfuss"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reuters ethereum", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "ger", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:16:33.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b025ac134f7b608b62a1c7f23781c903b3d48192", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbAyDpMzPU.q3nMW9V2_bqnJppky_a5BdKaw_wi99iUwWEmkW73DpUUDZyImLn85K2Se4f5m75_qaGxJAedRusb_yxW9qBzbwWnOOaPZN1Y.LtaOFW4ksz", "site_full": "allplacement-papers.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://allplacement-papers.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Placement papers | Freshers Walkin | Jobs daily", "title": "Lead NodeJs Software Engineer for Bitcoin Casino at BetKing () (allows remote)", "title_full": "Lead NodeJs Software Engineer for Bitcoin Casino at BetKing () (allows remote)", "published": "2018-05-18T10:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b025ac134f7b608b62a1c7f23781c903b3d48192", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbAyDpMzPU.q3nMW9V2_bqnJppky_a5BdKaw_wi99iUwWEmkW73DpUUDZyImLn85K2Se4f5m75_qaGxJAedRusb_yxW9qBzbwWnOOaPZN1Y.LtaOFW4ksz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bilal (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T10:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lead NodeJs Software Engineer for Bitcoin Casino at BetKing () (allows remote)", "text": "PLEASE NOTE: We are ONLY looking for people with experience in the gaming, financial or high...

Sometimes, these opportunities come in the form of entirely new markets. I’ve been interested in cryptocurrencies for a few years now, but I’ve been very reluctant to trade them, much less write about trading them. I felt that there was just too much risk. Especially for the average trader. …and quite frankly, I didn’t understand them well enough myself. The first time that I saw them as viable for trading was when I went to this conference at https://www.tradingheroes.com/one-trading-conference-a-year/. I saw Chris Dunn at https://chrisdunn.com/ talk about trading Bitcoin, but I was still skeptical that it would stay around for the long-term. …until recently. I credit my friend for talking to me about it on Twitter and opening my eyes to the potential in trading this emerging market. I’m not sure if he wants to be named, but you know who you are. I sincerely appreciate the education and helping me see the light! This is a perfect example of the benefit of staying in touch with other traders on platforms like Twitter at https://www.tradingheroes.com/how-to-connect-with-trading-mentors-and-friends-online-via-twitter-facebook-blogs-and-more/. Anyway, as I have done more research and have actually started trading them, I have found that there are tremendous opportunities. With some coins, it’s potentially like being able to get pre-IPO shares of Microsoft. But there are also big risks. Remember, the dot-com bust?\nThere will probably be losses of that magnitude too. That’s just how these new technologies work. So in this post, I want to share with you my knowledge of the cryptocurrency markets and give you a total beginner’s guide to trading them. Be sure to bookmark this page because I’ll continually update the information, as things change. For you crypto veterans, this will be very simplified, but my goal is to make this information as easy to understand as possible so new traders can make an informed decision about the opportunities. Once people get the general concepts, then they can geek out about the details. This is the future of FX trading. So in addition to USD/CHF, CAD/JPY and EUR/GBP, we also need to be aware of XLM/USD, ETH/BTC and XRP/LTC and more. Table Of Contents. What is a Cryptocurrency? Is Cryptocurrency Real Money?

You may have heard many things about what a cryptocurrency is, but you may still be searching for an understandable definition. I hear ya, I was in the same boat for a long time. Instead of getting too technical, here’s the easiest way to think about cryptocurrencies: A cryptocurrency is basically money on software platforms. It’s important to keep in mind that the teams/companies that are behind these cryptocurrencies are not only creating a new form of currency, but a new software platform. To demonstrate how this works, let’s take a look at other software platforms that you are probably already familiar with. Examining how these platforms work will help you understand cryptocurrencies. Here are a few software platforms that many people use. Windows: A software platform for personal computers. Dropbox: A software platform for storing and sharing documents. Fedwire: A software platform that sends money between financial institutions. On each of these platforms, a type of money is used, in exchange for using the platform: Windows: You pay US Dollars (or your local fiat currency at http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) to buy a license for Windows to use on your computer. If you buy a computer that already has Windows on it, the license fee is included in the purchase price. Dropbox: You pay US Dollars (or your local fiat currency) to buy a subscription to use the software for a month or a year, depending on which plan you buy.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-3/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\nCLICK HERE to submit a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-1/", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/how-to-connect-with-trading-mentors-and-friends-online-via-twitter-facebook-blogs-and-more/.", "https://chrisdunn.com/", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-3/", "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/one-trading-conference-a-year/.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T10:59:30.087+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81eb48fb4589232d636c3ca5b2f433b34715445a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9OMicHPdRxcW__jByKzpfMyZPyPd_sCqGrsJfNURYiELxLZArvKSJShiZDNrELbogmhkyiqeIWNA0l8vp4btuykq1IbYrBiSWEt82uJfJsVV9fnHTMEDfSvw03RGDJDcOPHRCpjfOH.X8B3T4d4GPRAkms9kHpvRTA--", "site_full": "www.pressat.co.uk", "site": "pressat.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.pressat.co.uk/rss/", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Pressat Main Newswire", "title": "The first real Smart Contract in the world for Bitcoin Holders", "title_full": "The first real Smart Contract in the world for Bitcoin Holders", "published": "2018-05-18T10:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81eb48fb4589232d636c3ca5b2f433b34715445a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9OMicHPdRxcW__jByKzpfMyZPyPd_sCqGrsJfNURYiELxLZArvKSJShiZDNrELbogmhkyiqeIWNA0l8vp4btuykq1IbYrBiSWEt82uJfJsVV9fnHTMEDfSvw03RGDJDcOPHRCpjfOH.X8B3T4d4GPRAkms9kHpvRTA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pressat", "published": "2018-05-18T10:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "The first real Smart Contract in the world for Bitcoin Holders", "text": "The first real Smart Contract in the world for Bitcoin Holders News provided by MyWish on Friday 18th May 2018\nIn the near future Bitcoin Smart Contracts will cover almost every single aspect of life so that cryptocurrency becomes part of the mainstream.\nSmart Contract is a blockchain analog of accustomed legal contracts\nTo be fair, this is one of a couple possible ways in which to use Smart Contracts. In this article, Smart Contracts are defined as a specific code to complement or completely replace customary legal contracts. Basically, Smart Contracts are the contracts on which terms are encoded in computer language instead of legal language. Up until now, the Smart Contract code has been fully supported by Ethereum, but never Bitcoin.\nThe issue is closed\nWe live in a great era; we are amazed by electric cars in the cosmos and robots with a sense of touch, but the issue of Bitcoin Smart Contracts was still hanging in the air until now. April 2018 has finally brought the solution to the riddle of a mysterious blockchain code that couldn’t find a sophisticated method use.\nWho is responsible for this?\nThis was made possible by 2 innovative blockchain platforms: RSK and MyWish.\nRSK is the first general purpose Smart Contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network. RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency. A 2-Way Peg between Bitcoin blockchain and RSK blockchain ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC. (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). MyWish is a full-cycle, decentralized Smart Contract platform with the following uses: Smart Contract creation, Audit, Deployment, Systematic calling on schedule, Execution.\nHow it works\nThe MyWish platform makes it affordable for everyone who wants to create a Smart Contract based on Bitcoin. RSK network is the platform to run MyWish Smart Contracts. This platform is in charge of converting Bitcoins in SmartBTC to make any transaction possible; mind that you will withdraw your invested Bitcoins in the end. SmartBTC is needed to break the code of BTC, which makes the creation of Smart Contract 98% impossible.\nThe first launched Bitcoin Smart Contract is dedicated to the last will and testament. Any person who holds their cryptocurrency investments in the form of Bitcoin could transfer savings to their family or friends in the event of their sudden illness or death.\nDue to the fact that security and reliability are 2 components that the independent world of Blockchain is missing, these two (MyWish platform and RSK platform) teams found the most trustworthy solution in response to that. A Smart Contract secures your assets no matter what. The original terms of Smart Contracts can’t be changed by anybody but the owner.\nWhat else to expect\nAs Smart Contracts bring stability and security, the demand increases more and more every day. In the near future Bitcoin Smart Contracts will cover almost every single aspect of life so that cryptocurrency becomes part of the mainstream. They are there when you want them to protect you.\nSee you soon and forever\nThe world’s first Bitcoin Smart Contracts are supported by RSK network and offered in an easy-to-use way by MyWish. MyWish and RSK platforms that offer customer support and willingly assist their clients in facing the future with reliable cryptocurrency transactions.

He has previously written for the Wall Street Journal, Slate, and a variety of other publications. Originally published at Grist\nBitcoin’s energy footprint has more than doubled since Grist first wrote about it six months ago.\nIt’s expected to double again by the end of the year, according to a new peer-reviewed study out Wednesday. And if that happens, bitcoin would be gobbling up 0.5 percent of the world’s electricity, about as much as the Netherlands.\nThat’s a troubling trajectory, especially for a world that should be working overtime to root out energy waste and fight climate change. By late next year, bitcoin could be consuming more electricity than all the world’s solar panels currently produce — about 1.8 percent of global electricity, according to a simple extrapolation of the study’s predictions. That would effectively erase decades of progress on renewable energy.\nAlthough the author of the study, Alex de Vries, an economist and data consultant based in the Netherlands, has shared these calculations publicly before , this is the first time that an analysis of bitcoin’s energy appetite has appeared in a peer-reviewed journal.\nBitcoin continues to soar in popularity — mostly as a speculative investment . And like any supercharged speculative investment, it swings wildly. Within the past 18 months, the price of bitcoin has soared ten-fold, crashed by 75 percent, only to double again, all while hedge funds and wealthy libertarians debate the future of the virtual currency.\nBeyond its tentative success as a get-rich-quick scheme, bitcoin has an increasingly real-world cost. The process of “mining” for coins requires a globally distributed computer network racing to solve math problems — and also helps keep any individual transaction confidential and tamper-proof. That, in turn, requires an ever-escalating arms race of computing power — and electricity use — which, at the moment, has no end in sight. A single bitcoin transaction is so energy intensive that it could power the average U.S. household for a month .\nA fluctuating bitcoin price, along with increases in computer efficiency, has slowed the cryptocurrency’s energy footprint growth rate to “just” 20 percent per month so far in this year. If that keeps up, bitcoin would consume all the world’s electricity by January 2021.\nThat simply won’t happen — government regulators would surely come to their senses by then — but it is a sign of bitcoin’s disastrous growth rate. In recent months, bitcoin supporters have criticized de Vries for being too pessimistic about its energy usage. But, as de Vries writes in the study, his estimates could also be missing out on secretive or illegal participation in the network, meaning there’s maybe even more happening than meets the eye. In at least one instance that de Vries found, a researcher was caught diverting a National Science Foundation supercomputer to mining bitcoin.\nIt’s a telling social phenomenon of late capitalism that we are willing to construct elaborate computer networks to conduct secure transactions with each other — and in the process torpedoing our hopes at a clean energy future.

Investing , Opinion | May 18, 2018 By: Trevor Gerszt, Coin IRA Founder\nBitcoin’s rapid rise in popularity has sparked interest in cryptocurrencies from financial institutions and the general public. Despite the media often portraying bitcoin as being nearly synonymous with the entire cryptocurrency market, the market is much bigger than just bitcoin. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence, and while the majority of them will not likely survive and won’t reach high valuations, there are several viable alternatives to bitcoin. One of the cryptocurrencies that has enjoyed aggressive growth and increased attention recently is Litecoin – a digital currency that is similar to bitcoin but possesses several key differences.\nWhat is Litecoin?\nLitecoin’s creator is well-known, unlike the anonymous creator of bitcoin. Litecoin was created by former Google employee Charlie Lee in 2011 and was based off the main code structure of bitcoin. It’s built upon blockchain, which is the underlying transparent technology that powers most cryptocurrencies and which functions as a ledger that is open for scrutiny to all parties involved in transactions.\nIt’s also a decentralized form of online currency that can be used to purchase services and goods. There are no fees to receive payments and no chargebacks with Litecoin, just as with bitcoin. Litecoin was the first “altcoin” that was a derivative of bitcoin, and it is attracting significant interest from investors and business entities that see its potential for running transactions and performing record keeping.\nKey Differences and Similarities Between Bitcoin and Litecoin\nLitecoin performs transactions faster than bitcoin, with block confirmation timings taking only 2.5 minutes, which is four times faster than bitcoin’s 10 minutes. The speed of these transactions is attractive for financial institutions that are looking at Litecoin as the preferred cryptocurrency payment coin. There’s more “utility” for Litecoin, while bitcoin is often seen as a counterpart to gold in terms of becoming a steady store of value for long-term investing.\nBitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency in circulation, with a market capitalization of around $145 billion, which dwarfs the current Litecoin market cap of $7.9 billion . There’s certainly more familiarity with the Bitcoin name outside of cryptocurrency circles, and bitcoin does attract a lot of investment from first-time cryptocurrency traders.\nSimilar to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there’s a set maximum limit of Litecoin that will ever be available. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined, while there are exactly four times as many (84 million) Litecoins that will be mined in the coming years. For either currency, there is still room for lower-priced transactions because each can be broken down into multiple decimal units. Investors in both cryptocurrencies never have to worry about inflation of the coin supply due to the finite supply of coins.

What a joke.\nWorse is that a large chunk of these gains are short term as I was fucking less than 2 weeks from long-term treatment on them. The rest was long-term, but - again - I had never planned on realizing them all in one go.\nI now have the money just sitting as cash now as I am scared of the tax bill and also BTC has just kept dropping. And now, I find out that Fidelity still allows US investors to hold and trade this COINXBT asset! So I could have conceivably transferred the asset to an account with them versus selling and having a realized gain.\nProbably too much time has passed (4 months now), but is there any way I can rebuy the exact same asset (COINXBT) at Fidelity and undo the earlier realized gain? Again, I was FORCED to sell and also pretty much LIED to by IB as Fidelity still trades this asset!\nI guess I can't even get much of a tax break by putting the cash into something like a charitable remainder trust as the gains are already \"realized?\" What can I do beyond just writing a check to the IRS?\nAppreciate any advice beyond the \"ask a tax advisor\" spiel. I have talked to several and they have NEVER heard of a forced liquidation like this.\n submitted by /u/randombull1\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:53:13.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac398c0b6925083d14d5e80bd628bf79c8589e83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNKCVZNkxdKZ5tGXys6p34yFuzVRhlliuVlGOO2Q9agBPlpRNX6k5f2w-", "site_full": "www.techbuzzonline.com", "site": "techbuzzonline.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechBuzzOnline", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tech Buzz Online", "title": "25 Free Bitcoin Stock Photos and Cryptocurrency Images", "title_full": "25 Free Bitcoin Stock Photos and Cryptocurrency Images", "published": "2018-05-18T10:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.techbuzzonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15-bitcoin-blockchain-currency.jpg?fit=800%2C480&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac398c0b6925083d14d5e80bd628bf79c8589e83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNKCVZNkxdKZ5tGXys6p34yFuzVRhlliuVlGOO2Q9agBPlpRNX6k5f2w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Om Prakash", "published": "2018-05-18T10:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "25 Free Bitcoin Stock Photos and Cryptocurrency Images", "text": "Share\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency are widespread in popularity and many services and products around the block-chain technology have come up in the past.

It is only trading on barterdex, Komodos DEX and it's ANN has been locked. Can someone fill me in on what happened to everyone that was holding supernet? Most new investors are clueless to how so many developers have worked on projects in the past and have abandoned them, I am not saying this is what happened to supernet thats why im here asking. KMD is an amazing coin and has a huge upside considering it has more features then NEO, WAVES...all the ERC20s that dont even have a mainnet yet (EOS, Vechain ect ect)....but people need to know about mr. lee's past with supernet, nxt...and all the nxt assets he created. NXT AE SuperNET was converted to SUPERNET assetchain, along with all the other NXT assets. The only exception was NXTventure which had its contents distributed out to its holders. All of my projects live on within the KMD ecosystem and anybody that is following me will know this. I dont abandon the people that have supported me.

In the US, China, and South Korea, many individual cryptocurrency miners and large-scale mining centers were cracked down for conducting illicit operations.\nFor example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos. In South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives.\nThe government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts. On April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city.\nAn in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates. By disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed.\nImage source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani In the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners.

Sometimes, these opportunities come in the form of entirely new markets. I’ve been interested in cryptocurrencies for a few years now, but I’ve been very reluctant to trade them, much less write about trading them. I felt that there was just too much risk. Especially for the average trader. …and quite frankly, I didn’t understand them well enough myself. The first time that I saw them as viable for trading was when I went to this conference at https://www.tradingheroes.com/one-trading-conference-a-year/. I saw Chris Dunn at https://chrisdunn.com/ talk about trading Bitcoin, but I was still skeptical that it would stay around for the long-term. …until recently. I credit my friend for talking to me about it on Twitter and opening my eyes to the potential in trading this emerging market. I’m not sure if he wants to be named, but you know who you are. I sincerely appreciate the education and helping me see the light! This is a perfect example of the benefit of staying in touch with other traders on platforms like Twitter at https://www.tradingheroes.com/how-to-connect-with-trading-mentors-and-friends-online-via-twitter-facebook-blogs-and-more/. Anyway, as I have done more research and have actually started trading them, I have found that there are tremendous opportunities. With some coins, it’s potentially like being able to get pre-IPO shares of Microsoft. But there are also big risks. Remember, the dot-com bust?\nThere will probably be losses of that magnitude too. That’s just how these new technologies work. So in this post, I want to share with you my knowledge of the cryptocurrency markets and give you a total beginner’s guide to trading them. Be sure to bookmark this page because I’ll continually update the information, as things change. For you crypto veterans, this will be very simplified, but my goal is to make this information as easy to understand as possible so new traders can make an informed decision about the opportunities. Once people get the general concepts, then they can geek out about the details. This is the future of FX trading. So in addition to USD/CHF, CAD/JPY and EUR/GBP, we also need to be aware of XLM/USD, ETH/BTC and XRP/LTC and more. Table Of Contents. What is a Cryptocurrency? Is Cryptocurrency Real Money?

You may have heard many things about what a cryptocurrency is, but you may still be searching for an understandable definition. I hear ya, I was in the same boat for a long time. Instead of getting too technical, here’s the easiest way to think about cryptocurrencies: A cryptocurrency is basically money on software platforms. It’s important to keep in mind that the teams/companies that are behind these cryptocurrencies are not only creating a new form of currency, but a new software platform. To demonstrate how this works, let’s take a look at other software platforms that you are probably already familiar with. Examining how these platforms work will help you understand cryptocurrencies. Here are a few software platforms that many people use. Windows: A software platform for personal computers. Dropbox: A software platform for storing and sharing documents. Fedwire: A software platform that sends money between financial institutions. On each of these platforms, a type of money is used, in exchange for using the platform: Windows: You pay US Dollars (or your local fiat currency at http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) to buy a license for Windows to use on your computer. If you buy a computer that already has Windows on it, the license fee is included in the purchase price. Dropbox: You pay US Dollars (or your local fiat currency) to buy a subscription to use the software for a month or a year, depending on which plan you buy.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-3/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-1/", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/how-to-connect-with-trading-mentors-and-friends-online-via-twitter-facebook-blogs-and-more/.", "https://chrisdunn.com/", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-3/", "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/one-trading-conference-a-year/.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:41:22.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8cbfa2bc3a061a0b3af935555f77e6cb98430de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSa4IlOUDHI93WfSFDoHhIk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "title_full": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T09:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.405, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8cbfa2bc3a061a0b3af935555f77e6cb98430de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSa4IlOUDHI93WfSFDoHhIk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gesdan", "published": "2018-05-18T09:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: hatendoringide on May 18, 2018, 08:15:02 AM If it can survive 20 more years, I'm sure the price will reach the bitcoin $50.000 or more, this is because the price increases very dramatically so that makes people keep buying bitcoin.\nNo, it's already outdated and you can't develop it much further.

Blockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5. The index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly. The sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62. China in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings. China was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.

This SDK is that global payment system.” Centbee is a next generation Bitcoin cash wallet.\nLast year, Centbee successfully piloted the acceptance of Bitcoin payments at retail PoS.\nIn January 2018, nChain’s investment arm, nChain Reaction, made an equity investment in Centbee. The “Internet of Transactions”\nnChain wants to transform how the world conducts all transactions – using the blockchain’s distributed, decentralised ledger that chronologically records transactions in an immutable way.\nThat’s why nChain is funding the bitcoin merchant PoS software development project.\nnChain’s objective is to promote its vision of making it easy for everyone to use Bitcoin Cash for payments. Dark Orange Bitcoin Sign Built as an Array of Transactions in Blockchain Conceptual 3d Illustration Background (Photo Credit: www.shutterstock.com)\nBitcoin Cash fulfils the original vision for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system specifically built for worldwide transactions.\n“As Centbee has focused on user-friendly Bitcoin wallets and merchant payment solutions we have partnered with them to ensure retailers can accept Bitcoin Cash at in-store points of sale for goods and services,” nChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen says.\n“This SDK will make it easier for merchants, through their PoS systems, to join the world of bCommerce. Centbee smartly embraces Bitcoin Cash because of its bigger blocks, low fees and fast transaction network represent the true vision of Bitcoin.”\nBased in South Africa, Centbee was founded in 2016 by co-CEOs, Lorien Gamaroff and Angus Brown.\nBrown has 20 years’ experience in payments and banking including the role of co-founder and CEO of eBucks.com, a world-first bank-backed digital currency created in 2000.\nGamaroff is a leading expert in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. He has consulted and advised regulators and large companies internationally and is highly regarded globally as an educator and presenter.\nCentbee is a gold member of AlphaCode , the fintech investment arm of Rand Merchant Investment Holdings .\n“We are excited about what Centbee is doing – helping crypto to go mainstream and providing real-world transactional capability. The Centbee origin story is also a good one as Lorien and Angus met at AlphaCode,” Dominique Collett, Head of AlphaCode says.\n“This is a great example of how putting smart people in a room together can unlock creative, new ideas and hopefully spawn large, successful businesses. This was the premise of establishing AlphaCode as a fintech community – to stimulate the development of the next generation of financial services entrepreneurs.” TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.alphacode.club/", "http://nchain.com/en/", "http://rmih.co.za/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lorien gam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy nguyen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centbee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus brown", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nchain group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:48:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f50d978a4c03fcb7b2214161f32b7979c085300b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMlqnfGDUNNS0EOsAp1c4pnh5tRcvw2bJCXzBkIgspmaFMvzkvUJ1ZOw6WF535Gr2DDr5ggk22Yfh9HhXaKY_Roiw0_SdwvAv4SFMKqQpHfcj.Zo1YvSVyrJrMYxHDsvFmao9ZdAVWip2vx40ENFGY2rap40.829Z8UVFojXIf2il", "site_full": "www.qtellbuyandsell.com", "site": "qtellbuyandsell.com", "site_section": "http://www.qtellbuyandsell.com/feed/posts/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Buy and Sell Free Classified Ads Free Post Buy and Sell Free Classifiedads Free Advertise World Global Free Post sell Free Classified  - Buy and Sell Free Classified Ads Free Post Buy and Sell Free Classifiedads Free Advertise World Global Free Post sell Free Classified", "title": "\"THE PASSIVE BITCOIN MACHINE\" (Washington DC)", "title_full": "\"THE PASSIVE BITCOIN MACHINE\" (Washington DC)", "published": "2018-05-18T09:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f50d978a4c03fcb7b2214161f32b7979c085300b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMlqnfGDUNNS0EOsAp1c4pnh5tRcvw2bJCXzBkIgspmaFMvzkvUJ1ZOw6WF535Gr2DDr5ggk22Yfh9HhXaKY_Roiw0_SdwvAv4SFMKqQpHfcj.Zo1YvSVyrJrMYxHDsvFmao9ZdAVWip2vx40ENFGY2rap40.829Z8UVFojXIf2il", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T09:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "\"THE PASSIVE BITCOIN MACHINE\" (Washington DC)", "text": "It is NOT ok to contact this poster with commercial interests.

Shortly before Christmas, it was trading at over $19,000; today, it is just $8,299. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin investors have been predicting meteoritic rises will recommence any day now. But Bitcoin has so far refused to cooperate, staying stubbornly stuck below $10,000 for the last two months. How can we know when - or if - it will rise again? PARIS, FRANCE - MAY 16: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the Bitcoin Digital Cryptocurrency is displayed on May 16, 2018 in Paris, France. Bitcoin is an electronic currency that has seen an incredible increase in 2017, its price has risen up to 20,000 euros but since the beginning of 2018, a sharp decline has seen it lose more than half of its value. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Cryptocurrency analysts Fundstrat think they have found a way of predicting the future price of Bitcoin. They used the expected path of breakeven Bitcoin mining costs to forecast that Bitcoin will reach $36,000 by the end of 2019: Fundstrat on Twitter Fundstrat Executive Summary\nBut this method has come in for considerable criticism from the Bitcoin community. On Twitter, Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream , claimed that Fundstrat's forecast relied on a controversial economic theory: Twitter Samson Mow on Twitter The “labor theory of value” essentially says that the price of a good or service is determined by the work required to produce it. It is popular with Marxist economists, but most other schools of economics have abandoned it in favour of “subjective valuation” which says that the value of a good or service is whatever someone will pay for it, regardless of the effort that went into producing it. Mow’s argument is that subjective valuation is the right way to understand Bitcoin’s price dynamics, not the labor theory of value. Of course, if the producer values the effort that goes into producing the good or service more highly than the market will pay, they will stop producing it. When prices fall, therefore, marginal producers tend to drop out, reducing the supply and hence raising the price. Producers who have inventories to run down and/or sufficient reserves to enable them to run at a loss may continue production for some time. But as time goes by, more and more producers drop out until prices rise enough for the market to clear. Similarly, when Bitcoin’s price falls, marginal miners drop out, as the cost of mining bitcoins starts to exceed the rewards. However, this creates a security risk. As the mining pool shrinks, predatory attempts to seize control of the pool (a 51% attack) become more attractive. Bitcoin therefore has an automatic adjustment mechanism to discourage miners from dropping out of the pool when the price falls. The algorithmic puzzles that miners have to solve become more difficult when Bitcoin’s price rises, and less difficult when the price falls. This keeps the rate of bitcoin production steady, at 1 block approximately every 10 minutes, while allowing the hashrate (the computing power needed to solve the puzzles) to fluctuate with the Bitcoin price. As the hashrate is effectively a measure of electricity usage, which is the main component of mining cost, miners’ breakeven costs tend to track the Bitcoin price. Fundstrat’s chart (also from Twitter) shows this clearly: Fundstrat Fundstrat Since the price floor set by the difficulty adjustment ties breakeven cost and price together, the breakeven cost trend is a reasonable predictor of the future price of Bitcoin. Samson Mow's criticism is therefore a trifle unfair. Fundstrat hasn't relied on the labor theory of value, though its summary does somewhat misleadingly imply that the mining cost rather than the difficulty adjustment supports the price. Of course, the support is asymmetric: Bitcoin’s price is supported on the downside, but not capped on the upside. This is because there is no need to defend against 51% attacks when the mining pool is expanding. However, it doesn’t seem to have occurred to anyone that massively rising breakeven costs create enormous barriers to entry which result in mining pool concentration . There may not be a 51% attack, but if the mining market becomes dominated by a small number of large players, the effect is much the same. Especially if those players cooperate . And there is a second problem, too. Bitcoin trades much like a commodity . Over the long-term, the market price of commodities tends towards their marginal cost of production. Putting this another way, mining profits eventually fall to zero. As I noted earlier, when profits fall to zero, producers eventually stop producing. But whereas commodities would still be traded if mining ceased, Bitcoin would instantly die. This is because the real job of miners is not bitcoin production, but transaction verification. Without transaction verification, bitcoins can’t be bought, can’t be sold, can’t be spent, can’t be earned. If mining ceased, existing bitcoins would become immovable - and an immovable asset is worthless. Thus, unlike a commodity, if mining profits fell to zero, so would the value of all existing bitcoins. The difficulty adjustment artificially preserves the profit margins of miners to ensure that enough of them continue to mine. This protects Bitcoin from attacks, but it has serious implications for the financial sustainability of Bitcoin as a transaction system. At present, new bitcoins are part of mining rewards. But the new bitcoin component of mining reward halves every few years. Eventually it will reach zero. As the difficulty adjustment forces mining profits to stay positive, falling profit margins – whether due to price falls or halving – must be offset by rising transaction fees. The users of the system will have to pay miners increasing amounts of bitcoin to keep them mining honestly. In my view this means that viewing Bitcoin as a commodity is wrong. Miners provide a service – transaction verification – upon which the users of Bitcoin critically depend. Without that service, Bitcoin would die. But miners also depend for their profits on the willingness of users to transact. If the fees rose too high, users would stop using Bitcoin for transactions, and Bitcoin would die. The equilibrium transaction fee would be the point at which there are sufficient users to provide a reasonable volume of transactions for verification, and sufficient miners to perform verification honestly. Ultimately, what determines the value of Bitcoin is whether people are willing to transact using it. That includes buying and selling bitcoins, of course, since trading is transacting. But will the Bitcoin price continue to rise steeply enough for users to remain willing to pay ever-higher transaction fees? Or will there eventually be a “death spiral” triggered by falling prices as users leave the system en masse, followed by miners giving up as collapsing transaction volumes force fees down to zero?

People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus — which represents revolution and change — from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they’re moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it’s not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter — proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he believes.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,” he said. “Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines earlier this month for the same reason: he bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shake-up is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on significant zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n“My dad studied astrology and I’ve been learning about for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,” he said. “Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.”\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst — which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors — said he expects bitcoin\nBTCUSD, -1.45%\nto fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his clients they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based astrology alone.\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,” he told MarketWatch .\nMerriman believes planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement , which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius — a sign of “new ideas and machines.” From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20% of investors at large make decisions based on horoscopes — a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults believe astrology is a science . Merriman himself has more than 1,000 clients and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n“It doesn’t worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,” he said. “If you look at correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you’d be amazed.”\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women’s website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,” she said. “Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don’t. Founders of popular astrology app Co-star told MarketWatch they shy away from any kind of financial advice because it can have major effects on people’s lives. Still, Gat noted, it’s a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n“Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,” she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&#038;information_id=4", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:01:38.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c73f1950c8552fb929180cd3b11d68d1731e936", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DShJf07qZbNzdcoZYG9X57Rlyg3FGnlLNWirMB3VLlTCg--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Revisiting the Downside Targets", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Revisiting the Downside Targets", "published": "2018-05-18T09:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c73f1950c8552fb929180cd3b11d68d1731e936", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DShJf07qZbNzdcoZYG9X57Rlyg3FGnlLNWirMB3VLlTCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T09:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Revisiting the Downside Targets", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\nBitcoin price is still on the move down and is testing the first Fib extension level. Stronger selling pressure could take it lower to the next downside targets also shown by the Fib extension tool Technical indicators are suggesting that bears could stay in control of bitcoin price action for a bit longer. Bitcoin price has completed its correction and is on its way to test the downside targets marked by the Fib extension tool.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that selling pressure could persist. These moving averages have also held as dynamic resistance on a quick pullback and might continue to keep gains in check.\nPrice is currently testing the 38.2% extension at $8,000 and a move lower could lead to a test of the 50% extension at $7,316. Stronger selling momentum could take bitcoin price down to the 61.8% extension at $6,694 near the swing low or the 78.6% extension at $5,808. The full extension is located at $4,680.7.\nRSI is pointing down to signal that sellers are in control of the game and could take bitcoin price for further losses. Stochstic is also heading south but is dipping into oversold levels to reflect some exhaustion and hint at a possible return in bullish momentum.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nIf the 38.2% extension is enough to keep losses at bay, bitcoin could still have a shot at forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This would be a classic reversal signal, hinting that price is done with the drop and that a longer-term uptrend is in the works. Price has yet to break past the neckline at $10,000 for this to happen though.\nIt would take a really strong market catalyst to spur such a strong climb, especially since the $10,000 handle has held as a ceiling for quite some time. So far, investors seem more cautious on the rejection at key inflection points.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Revisiting the Downside Targets appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:03:39.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e7eb1296abbf5e5463705f96dd1cf14bb3a50af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTDEyaSxAVaoxdZZCd6XVA.ErbkL6PLX5doIpNtU79eXmO9a06xRRvNNybLbxPOaPes-", "site_full": "freeq.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://freeq.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8046.25 – FREEQ Crypto News", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8046.25", "title_full": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8046.25", "published": "2018-05-18T09:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e7eb1296abbf5e5463705f96dd1cf14bb3a50af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTDEyaSxAVaoxdZZCd6XVA.ErbkL6PLX5doIpNtU79eXmO9a06xRRvNNybLbxPOaPes-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FR33Q", "published": "2018-05-18T09:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8046.25", "text": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8046.25\nMay 18, 2018 at 07:59AM\nvia Chain", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:01:47.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5375ed42e21385e60296334beaaa29dcddf4e35f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4s3XscR8pvxfyAiJGOy2B4weDSrs0gg8Ah4TSsxdp41DD9ytt8cGOpXhTuiF3P87qlrdhFSnYeFogywenDn1G5fHncNZOJbRg35Qo8EgtRpnBmLDr_efFgy4Qp8h6j8eW_9qZy0gPtA--", "site_full": "www.richardhartley.com", "site": "richardhartley.com", "site_section": "http://www.richardhartley.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Richard Hartley", "title": "The crypto-future is female: bitcoin innovators push for inclusion", "title_full": "The crypto-future is female: bitcoin innovators push for inclusion", "published": "2018-05-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5375ed42e21385e60296334beaaa29dcddf4e35f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4s3XscR8pvxfyAiJGOy2B4weDSrs0gg8Ah4TSsxdp41DD9ytt8cGOpXhTuiF3P87qlrdhFSnYeFogywenDn1G5fHncNZOJbRg35Qo8EgtRpnBmLDr_efFgy4Qp8h6j8eW_9qZy0gPtA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Richard Hartley", "published": "2018-05-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The crypto-future is female: bitcoin innovators push for inclusion", "text": "Tweet ‘Silicon Valley is completely run by men. We think cryptocurrencies should be built with a different system and values in mind.’ Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images\n“Satoshi is female” was one of the more pervasive slogans at Consensus 2018 , the world’s largest blockchain conference that saw thousands of crypto-believers descend on midtown New York for a packed, three-day meet-and-greet last week.\nSatoshi refers to Satoshi Nakamoto, the still mysterious creator of Bitcoin who has never been identified but who, nonetheless, is credited as the founding father of cryptocurrency, or a digital form of money, and blockchain, a public and uneditable system for recording transactions. Both developments are hailed by their evangelists as potentially revolutionary technological tools.\nAs crowds packed Manhattan’s midtown Hilton to listen to leadingtechnology figures such as Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and the cryptography pioneer Bailey Whitfield ‘Whit’ Diffie , the question of Satoshi’s gender was purely symbolic. But it was also understood by many attendees: blockchain should not simply perpetuate the white male tech nerd stereotypical worldview of Silicon Valley.\n“We think cryptocurrencies should be built with a different system and values in mind,” said Nyla Rodgers, the creator of the Satoshi Is Female group. “Silicon Valley is completely run by men. Women only receive 2% of venture capital funding so their ideas never rise to the top. We’ve been living with a very one-sided view of the world.” A post shared by Satoshi Is Female (@satoshiisfemale) on Mar 20, 2018 at 9:34am PDT\nThe expression of a male-led crypto world is already self-evident. The frothy, unstable cryptocurrency sector is dominated by images of Lamborghinis – “Lambos” – and “going moon” as cryptocurrencies surge in price.\nCryptocurrency and blockchain has already received bad press for being overly gendered and insufficiently woke. In February, the North American Bitcoin Conference wrapped up 10 hours of speeches by inviting 5,000 attendees to what it called a “networking party” in a 20,000 sq ft strip club.\nTo women in the crypto sector attending Consensus, there’s no time to lose if blockchain technology isn’t going to follow the same path as Silicon Valley.\nBlockchain has only been around for 18 months, so as women can help define what the culture looks like Nyla Rodgers, creator of Satoshi Is Female\nA recent study found that while there was improvement in the number of women in the industry in the wake of several sexism and discrimination scandals, the participation of racial minorities was worsening.\n“Blockchain has only been around for 18 months so we, as women, can help define what the culture looks like at the beginning,” said Rodgers who is raising money to fund women-led tech groups, many in the developing world, through her charity Mama Hope. “The urgency is there for women and minorities to create a system that actually values them.”\nOn the first day of New York’s crypto-week, the entrepreneur Cindy Chin held a seminar Women on The Block with the express purpose of creating a sense of inclusion in the blockchain world.\n“We think there’s an opportunity to change what has really been an all-male space,” Chin says. “We want to be part of the conversation, we want to drive the leadership, to be part of the deal-flow and we want to be invested in ... we want the money!” Bitcoin made simple\nCertain women are already gaining recognition, among them Perianne Boring, founder and chairwoman of the Digital Chamber of Commerce , billing itself as the world’s largest trade association representing the blockchain industry.\n“Blockchain is an opportunity for women to participate,” said Sheri Kaiserman, who was Wedbush Securities Inc’s head of equities when she published the first Wall Street analysis of Bitcoin’s value. She now heads a blockchain investment and advisory fund Maco.LA , she said she’s found the blockchain sector broadly welcoming to women.\n“Women have a lot of opportunities in this space to really pave the way and take ownership of a lot new projects. Because it so new we, as women, can really make a lot of headway and progress in changing the future,” she said.\nMatthew Roszak, founder of Bloq, one of the fair’s major sponsors, said the technology’s current lack of formal structure was also its advantage in terns of gender and racial diversity.\nRelated: Don’t let bitcoin greed blind you to the potential of blockchain technology | John Naughton\n“The complexion of blockchain, its decentralized nature, the fact that its so multi-disciplinary, attracts not only women but a more diverse group of people,” he said. “That’s not just an aspiration but a reality.”\nAt Consensus, the African-American investor George Ewang said he saw some opportunity for minorities to help shape the emerging technology. But, he said, there was still a hangover from the lack of diversity through the first wave of the tech revolution in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n“Technology has historically been unreceptive to people from other backgrounds and pushed them away, its been hard for those people to now come into crypto-land.”\nThe advantage of crypto, he said, was the decentralization of the technology that allowed people to invest and participate from within their own societies. With education and encouragement, Ewang said, he’d overcome his reservations.\n“Crypto is open-minded. It’s not just a Silicon Valley thing anymore. It’s people from all over the world. Not just Caucasian men.” Jack Dorsey, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter, speaks at the Consensus 2018 conference. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters\nBut clearly considerable hurdles remain. A review of 1,450 digital coin offerings published by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday found investors had poured more than $1bn in 271 coin offerings that included plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns or in some cases missing or fake executive teams.\nMoreover, there’d been speculation that New York’s Blockchain Week would help bring stability to the cryptocurrency valuations by conferring the interest of mainstream financial firms in the sector.\nBut instead of pushing the price of Bitcoin back above the psychological $10,000 mark, that coin and other leading digital currencies, including EOS and Cardano, tumbled. The market dropped by more than $30bn overnight, from $408bn to $377bn.\nNor did it help that Vitalik Buterin, creator of the Ethereum cryptocurrency, announced that he would not attend the $2,000-ticket event. He slammed Consensus organizer Coindesk for overcharging: “I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent-seeking,” he posted on Twitter.\nBut that could not dull the overall spirit of many attendees. Rosario Pabst, a representative of platform ZenCash , said she believed the blockchain sector would steadily throw off its rogueish reputation.\n“‘Lambos’ and ‘going moon’ just shows the immaturity of the space and where it started,” Pabst said. “Right now you have to hold onto your pants, it’s still unstable. But if you have bright ideas and hard-working you’re going to succeed.”\nSatoshi Nakamoto, Pabst added, could be female after all.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/10/bitcoin-soaring-value-buyers-infectious-disease-barclays-economists-say", "https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2014/apr/30/bitcoin-made-simple-video-animation", "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/13/dont-let-bitcoin-greed-blind-you-to-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin", "https://www.mamahope.org/", "https://www.satoshiisfemale.com/", "https://www.bloq.com/", "https://www.coindesk.com/whitfield-diffie-talks-cryptography-resurgence-blockchain/", "https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/989530226718687232", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buyer-beware-hundreds-of-bitcoin-wannabes-show-hallmarks-of-fraud-1526573115", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/188644617/Bitcoin-Intrinsic-Value-Wedbush-Report-December-2013", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/10/03/diversity-and-silicon-valley-race-not-gender-gap-gets-worse/727240001/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BgjUl8MlzZj/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/a-bitcoin-conference-rented-a-miami-strip-club-regrets-ensued", "https://www.instagram.com/satoshiisfemale/", "https://gu.com/p/3zgvh", "https://www.womenontheblock.io/", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://zencash.com/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/", "https://digitalchamber.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bailey whitfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diffie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hilton", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T11:56:45.075+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85aecec04c9271b22b91f622c60961e92c636988", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1Yn21XRlV5G_CwOpjQEqPhPxA8ingRpC9k.BCEXuzJMHq0tAyf6QdemKYwHuK5azu0MgHGFs_u6ENICuduyAu6C6UykOdjYiLT4zZhW6GBdvOA-", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Bitcoin exploits energy use, and you are worse than usual for Libertarian nerds", "title_full": "Bitcoin exploits energy use, and you are worse than usual for Libertarian nerds", "published": "2018-05-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-exploits-energy-use-and-you-are-worse-than-usual-for-Libertarian-nerds.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85aecec04c9271b22b91f622c60961e92c636988", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1Yn21XRlV5G_CwOpjQEqPhPxA8ingRpC9k.BCEXuzJMHq0tAyf6QdemKYwHuK5azu0MgHGFs_u6ENICuduyAu6C6UykOdjYiLT4zZhW6GBdvOA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin exploits energy use, and you are worse than usual for Libertarian nerds", "text": " Bitcoin exploits energy use, and you are worse than usual for Libertarian nerds\nIt’s expected to double again by the end of the year, according to a new peer-reviewed study out Wednesday.

His ownership stake had long since been extinguished, and by then he was little more than a front for the syndicate of creditors who actually controlled what remained of Trump’s portfolio after 1990, when he faced bankruptcy in all but name. Yet Trump insisted of the Plaza purchaser, “I put him through the wringer and made a great deal.”\nWe should probably expect the Plaza Hotel treatment for the coming Kim-Trump summit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has demanded “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization,” or CVID in the argot of the negotiators. That will not be forthcoming. But perhaps something else will: a testing pause, maybe, or some other interim measure that can somehow be upgraded into the promised “great deal.”\nThe administration may have little choice by now but to carry on the pretense that it is scoring a great success in its Korea negotiations, and for two reasons.\nFirst, US options in the Korean peninsula depend heavily on the cooperation of South Korea. Trump has now thoroughly frightened and alienated South Korean opinion. South Korea’s dovish president, Moon Jae In, was elected with only 41% of the vote. Polls now show his approval rating in the mid-70s, because of his success in drawing Trump away from “fire and fury” and toward negotiations. As Robert Kelly of Pusan National University in South Korea observes, revulsion against Trump has consolidated a dovish consensus in South Korea.\nMuch of the work of snookering Trump into the Kim summit has actually been done by South Koreans, not North Koreans. It was President Moon who slyly insinuated that Trump deserved a Nobel Prize for the summit—bait that Trump swallowed like a credulous guppy. In fact, it was a South Korean delegation that first put the summit idea into Trump’s head back in March. It was the South Koreans who immediately announced Trump’s impulsive “yes” answer at the very entrance to the West Wing, thus effectively locking the door behind the president before he understood the full implications of what he had done—and before he could be dissuaded by his staff and secretary of state.\n«", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:22:26.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef410bf29fccfec36ff532c4e4ac702c488627cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.T2wVeinRzDKhzP0GwY2KvVRSAMMqYY5FpEd5PK07Or0RO6I12VYOQusgRDVseuCj8UaVaJt551ilPxOLZIZNL9H40u1L9.6yyaGmKzm7j5_qXYEzYLbXgo3oe2GFDAow-", "site_full": "www.execreview.com", "site": "execreview.com", "site_section": "http://www.execreview.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "finance", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "ExecReview", "title": "The crypto-future is female: bitcoin innovators push for inclusion", "title_full": "The crypto-future is female: bitcoin innovators push for inclusion", "published": "2018-05-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef410bf29fccfec36ff532c4e4ac702c488627cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.T2wVeinRzDKhzP0GwY2KvVRSAMMqYY5FpEd5PK07Or0RO6I12VYOQusgRDVseuCj8UaVaJt551ilPxOLZIZNL9H40u1L9.6yyaGmKzm7j5_qXYEzYLbXgo3oe2GFDAow-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The crypto-future is female: bitcoin innovators push for inclusion", "text": "Tweet ‘Silicon Valley is completely run by men. We think cryptocurrencies should be built with a different system and values in mind.’ Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images\n“Satoshi is female” was one of the more pervasive slogans at Consensus 2018 , the world’s largest blockchain conference that saw thousands of crypto-believers descend on midtown New York for a packed, three-day meet-and-greet last week.\nSatoshi refers to Satoshi Nakamoto, the still mysterious creator of Bitcoin who has never been identified but who, nonetheless, is credited as the founding father of cryptocurrency, or a digital form of money, and blockchain, a public and uneditable system for recording transactions. Both developments are hailed by their evangelists as potentially revolutionary technological tools.\nAs crowds packed Manhattan’s midtown Hilton to listen to leadingtechnology figures such as Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and the cryptography pioneer Bailey Whitfield ‘Whit’ Diffie , the question of Satoshi’s gender was purely symbolic. But it was also understood by many attendees: blockchain should not simply perpetuate the white male tech nerd stereotypical worldview of Silicon Valley.\n“We think cryptocurrencies should be built with a different system and values in mind,” said Nyla Rodgers, the creator of the Satoshi Is Female group. “Silicon Valley is completely run by men. Women only receive 2% of venture capital funding so their ideas never rise to the top. We’ve been living with a very one-sided view of the world.” A post shared by Satoshi Is Female (@satoshiisfemale) on Mar 20, 2018 at 9:34am PDT\nThe expression of a male-led crypto world is already self-evident. The frothy, unstable cryptocurrency sector is dominated by images of Lamborghinis – “Lambos” – and “going moon” as cryptocurrencies surge in price.\nCryptocurrency and blockchain has already received bad press for being overly gendered and insufficiently woke. In February, the North American Bitcoin Conference wrapped up 10 hours of speeches by inviting 5,000 attendees to what it called a “networking party” in a 20,000 sq ft strip club.\nTo women in the crypto sector attending Consensus, there’s no time to lose if blockchain technology isn’t going to follow the same path as Silicon Valley.\nBlockchain has only been around for 18 months, so as women can help define what the culture looks like Nyla Rodgers, creator of Satoshi Is Female\nA recent study found that while there was improvement in the number of women in the industry in the wake of several sexism and discrimination scandals, the participation of racial minorities was worsening.\n“Blockchain has only been around for 18 months so we, as women, can help define what the culture looks like at the beginning,” said Rodgers who is raising money to fund women-led tech groups, many in the developing world, through her charity Mama Hope. “The urgency is there for women and minorities to create a system that actually values them.”\nOn the first day of New York’s crypto-week, the entrepreneur Cindy Chin held a seminar Women on The Block with the express purpose of creating a sense of inclusion in the blockchain world.\n“We think there’s an opportunity to change what has really been an all-male space,” Chin says. “We want to be part of the conversation, we want to drive the leadership, to be part of the deal-flow and we want to be invested in ... we want the money!” Bitcoin made simple\nCertain women are already gaining recognition, among them Perianne Boring, founder and chairwoman of the Digital Chamber of Commerce , billing itself as the world’s largest trade association representing the blockchain industry.\n“Blockchain is an opportunity for women to participate,” said Sheri Kaiserman, who was Wedbush Securities Inc’s head of equities when she published the first Wall Street analysis of Bitcoin’s value. She now heads a blockchain investment and advisory fund Maco.LA , she said she’s found the blockchain sector broadly welcoming to women.\n“Women have a lot of opportunities in this space to really pave the way and take ownership of a lot new projects. Because it so new we, as women, can really make a lot of headway and progress in changing the future,” she said.\nMatthew Roszak, founder of Bloq, one of the fair’s major sponsors, said the technology’s current lack of formal structure was also its advantage in terns of gender and racial diversity.\nRelated: Don’t let bitcoin greed blind you to the potential of blockchain technology | John Naughton\n“The complexion of blockchain, its decentralized nature, the fact that its so multi-disciplinary, attracts not only women but a more diverse group of people,” he said. “That’s not just an aspiration but a reality.”\nAt Consensus, the African-American investor George Ewang said he saw some opportunity for minorities to help shape the emerging technology. But, he said, there was still a hangover from the lack of diversity through the first wave of the tech revolution in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n“Technology has historically been unreceptive to people from other backgrounds and pushed them away, its been hard for those people to now come into crypto-land.”\nThe advantage of crypto, he said, was the decentralization of the technology that allowed people to invest and participate from within their own societies. With education and encouragement, Ewang said, he’d overcome his reservations.\n“Crypto is open-minded. It’s not just a Silicon Valley thing anymore. It’s people from all over the world. Not just Caucasian men.” Jack Dorsey, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter, speaks at the Consensus 2018 conference. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters\nBut clearly considerable hurdles remain. A review of 1,450 digital coin offerings published by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday found investors had poured more than $1bn in 271 coin offerings that included plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns or in some cases missing or fake executive teams.\nMoreover, there’d been speculation that New York’s Blockchain Week would help bring stability to the cryptocurrency valuations by conferring the interest of mainstream financial firms in the sector.\nBut instead of pushing the price of Bitcoin back above the psychological $10,000 mark, that coin and other leading digital currencies, including EOS and Cardano, tumbled. The market dropped by more than $30bn overnight, from $408bn to $377bn.\nNor did it help that Vitalik Buterin, creator of the Ethereum cryptocurrency, announced that he would not attend the $2,000-ticket event. He slammed Consensus organizer Coindesk for overcharging: “I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent-seeking,” he posted on Twitter.\nBut that could not dull the overall spirit of many attendees. Rosario Pabst, a representative of platform ZenCash , said she believed the blockchain sector would steadily throw off its rogueish reputation.\n“‘Lambos’ and ‘going moon’ just shows the immaturity of the space and where it started,” Pabst said. “Right now you have to hold onto your pants, it’s still unstable. But if you have bright ideas and hard-working you’re going to succeed.”\nSatoshi Nakamoto, Pabst added, could be female after all.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/10/bitcoin-soaring-value-buyers-infectious-disease-barclays-economists-say", "https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2014/apr/30/bitcoin-made-simple-video-animation", "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/13/dont-let-bitcoin-greed-blind-you-to-the-potential-of-blockchain-technology", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin", "https://www.mamahope.org/", "https://www.satoshiisfemale.com/", "https://www.bloq.com/", "https://www.coindesk.com/whitfield-diffie-talks-cryptography-resurgence-blockchain/", "https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/989530226718687232", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buyer-beware-hundreds-of-bitcoin-wannabes-show-hallmarks-of-fraud-1526573115", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/188644617/Bitcoin-Intrinsic-Value-Wedbush-Report-December-2013", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/10/03/diversity-and-silicon-valley-race-not-gender-gap-gets-worse/727240001/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BgjUl8MlzZj/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/a-bitcoin-conference-rented-a-miami-strip-club-regrets-ensued", "https://www.instagram.com/satoshiisfemale/", "https://gu.com/p/3zgvh", "https://www.womenontheblock.io/", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://zencash.com/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/", "https://digitalchamber.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bailey whitfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diffie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hilton", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T10:34:22.068+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb7200d850f60e311befe08d87af9a95de3b2135", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgEDiDOSPMabeWNwmhX5P0eggvLVjB7Shr.hWOUuhcS4Kq8Igs5g2afnRMRWu0Yf2GoW6illdsR5JPP4CUrRNlSH1LGPiiuQchR7dofXA1NpR51RC6IVB.ctJxru454hHi.j.ecn4mr.S7VEEnXjOKmrXx2Ai73Z246p9oGNRoKL3_hclO7VVMcMXh3xvgpD30FA--", "site_full": "forums.rabidbadger.io", "site": "rabidbadger.io", "site_section": "https://forums.rabidbadger.io/forum/news-and-information/science-and-technology", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Science and Technology -

Sometimes, these opportunities come in the form of entirely new markets. I’ve been interested in cryptocurrencies for a few years now, but I’ve been very reluctant to trade them, much less write about trading them. I felt that there was just too much risk. Especially for the average trader. …and quite frankly, I didn’t understand them well enough myself. The first time that I saw them as viable for trading was when I went to this conference at https://www.tradingheroes.com/one-trading-conference-a-year/. I saw Chris Dunn at https://chrisdunn.com/ talk about trading Bitcoin, but I was still skeptical that it would stay around for the long-term. …until recently. I credit my friend for talking to me about it on Twitter and opening my eyes to the potential in trading this emerging market. I’m not sure if he wants to be named, but you know who you are. I sincerely appreciate the education and helping me see the light! This is a perfect example of the benefit of staying in touch with other traders on platforms like Twitter at https://www.tradingheroes.com/how-to-connect-with-trading-mentors-and-friends-online-via-twitter-facebook-blogs-and-more/. Anyway, as I have done more research and have actually started trading them, I have found that there are tremendous opportunities. With some coins, it’s potentially like being able to get pre-IPO shares of Microsoft. But there are also big risks. Remember, the dot-com bust?\nThere will probably be losses of that magnitude too. That’s just how these new technologies work. So in this post, I want to share with you my knowledge of the cryptocurrency markets and give you a total beginner’s guide to trading them. Be sure to bookmark this page because I’ll continually update the information, as things change. For you crypto veterans, this will be very simplified, but my goal is to make this information as easy to understand as possible so new traders can make an informed decision about the opportunities. Once people get the general concepts, then they can geek out about the details. This is the future of FX trading. So in addition to USD/CHF, CAD/JPY and EUR/GBP, we also need to be aware of XLM/USD, ETH/BTC and XRP/LTC and more. Table Of Contents. What is a Cryptocurrency? Is Cryptocurrency Real Money?

You may have heard many things about what a cryptocurrency is, but you may still be searching for an understandable definition. I hear ya, I was in the same boat for a long time. Instead of getting too technical, here’s the easiest way to think about cryptocurrencies: A cryptocurrency is basically money on software platforms. It’s important to keep in mind that the teams/companies that are behind these cryptocurrencies are not only creating a new form of currency, but a new software platform. To demonstrate how this works, let’s take a look at other software platforms that you are probably already familiar with. Examining how these platforms work will help you understand cryptocurrencies. Here are a few software platforms that many people use. Windows: A software platform for personal computers. Dropbox: A software platform for storing and sharing documents. Fedwire: A software platform that sends money between financial institutions. On each of these platforms, a type of money is used, in exchange for using the platform: Windows: You pay US Dollars (or your local fiat currency at http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) to buy a license for Windows to use on your computer. If you buy a computer that already has Windows on it, the license fee is included in the purchase price. Dropbox: You pay US Dollars (or your local fiat currency) to buy a subscription to use the software for a month or a year, depending on which plan you buy.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-3/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.tradingheroes.com/how-to-connect-with-trading-mentors-and-friends-online-via-twitter-facebook-blogs-and-more/.", "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp)", "https://chrisdunn.com/", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/one-trading-conference-a-year/.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency trading-part", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T04:19:16.084+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eff504e096988c82b52ec4ce7a2e6280a420993c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFqmCn7JudJTLmNzB09TNIwRBmeAvNfuYNg.0t.MCYoy1G5cpmdEhBVuBgEog1NUT3iact_SBzHSx", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Blaxwork works against sales posts.

He had a net worth of $2.6 billion in 2017. Thiel runs Founders Fund which bought $12 million to $20 million of cryptocurrency asset in Bitcoin which caused a rise in the price of Bitcoin by 9% within 24 hours of purchase in January.\nHe stated that Bitcoin has a high possibility of becoming of store value instead of a go-to currency for everyday use. He also says that there is a 50-80 percent chance of Bitcoin falling down to a point where it would be useless and a 20-50 percent chance of it going higher in its price.\nHe also says:\n“I’m not sure I would encourage people to run out right now and buy these cryptocurrencies.”\nHe also says that other coins like Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin is only due to its bigger and better features, but the demand for Bitcoin remains huge.

Even before the fork, BCH had a really close market cap to Ripple and was showing positive signs to win the spot. But the result turned out to be underwhelming as BCH did not take the 3rd spot and it also drastically declined in price reaching below $1300 dollars.\nThe fork brought various changes to Bitcoin Cash and its wallet .

But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule, financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\nshituationist :\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month . By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts–as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world’s total consumption. “To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity. “That would be quite bad.”",

Gold investment by contrast is far more pedestrian, maintaining a measured store of value throughout the millennia. Are you prepared to bet your future on a roller coaster ride?\nIt is currently fashionable to pay for your latte with Bitcoin at the handful of trendy coffee shops that accept the cryptocurrency. You could also theoretically use your legal tender gold coins to pay for a macchiato, (although they might struggle to give change for a£970 ounce of gold). Both are a form of currency, and both are highly valued in the market today, but which is a better investment?\nAny currency relies on the belief that someone else will want that currency and you will be able to exchange it for goods. Reputation matters and it is in this regard Bitcoin comes to the table at a distinct disadvantage, with very little history and a reputation as the currency of choice for thieves and black-market traders (a legacy of its use by unscrupulous online criminals who appreciate its anonymity). That said its value has surged (and plummeted) over the last few years, so there are some investors who bought and sold at an opportune time and made a profit,but its volatility has worked against it too.\nJosh Saul, CEO of The Pure Gold Company says: “When Bitcoin dropped in late 2017, we had a lot of people liquidate what they could to purchase physical gold – they craved safety, security and consistency. We’ve seen a 76% increase in people selling Bitcoin to purchase physical gold in 2018. Some of our clients are comfortable purchasing Bitcoin, but only if they also own gold to iron out the volatility.” History\nGold has a venerable history as a store of wealth. It has been used for thousands of years as a currency because of its rarity and elemental stability. It doesn’t tarnish, is relatively easy to melt to produce coins or other trade able currency, and is rare enough to have an intrinsic value placed on it by centuries of civilizations.\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 as a decentralized digital crypto currency that works without a central bank or administrator.It is stored in a digital wallet and is transferred from peer to peer without a bank or intermediary. Its dissociation from the banking system is a key selling point for some investors who worry about systemic risk, but that same detachment and anonymity has made it attractive to online criminals and tarnished its reputation. Mining\nGold deposits are mined out of the ground by mining companies.\nBitcoin are ‘mined’ by a network of thousands of computers that turn Bitcoin transactions into mathematical puzzles. The ledger of Bitcoin transactions is unchangeable because multiple miners in the network verify the transactions. There is a swathe of technical nuance to the process, much of which is indecipherable to all but the most technologically minded (see do I need to understand it ?) Do I need to understand it?\nHistory and reputation provide a solid basis on which to understand the process of gold mining, its use as a valid currency and the popularity of gold investment.\nMost people don’t understand how Bitcoin works, including many finance professionals. This doesn’t have to be a hindrance to investment but it does make it more difficult to understand the risks associated with Bitcoin. For example understanding blockchain technology provides insight into the security of the cryptocurrency. Knowing how supply is limited provides insight into the risk of Bitcoin inflation. All the risks of the mining process and the Bitcoin wallet system lie in understanding the process which is complex and highly mathematical, and beyond the comprehension of most people. Value and volatility\nOn 10 May the gold price was £976 per ounce. One Bitcoin was worth £6734. The value of both commodities fluctuates every day, but there is substantially more volatility in the value of Bitcoin.\nIn 2016 gold rose 50% from £700 to over £1,055 in around six months, and has since fluctuated just above or just below £1,000. Investors looking to add the yellow metal to their portfolio can buy physical gold, a gold Exchange Traded Fund or shares in a gold miner. All these mainstream products are easily accessible, legal, traceable and transparent.\nIn 2017 Bitcoin surged almost 150% from less than £6000in November to over £14,500 a little over a month later. It then slumped 30% to below £10,000 within weeks, and had fallen to almost £5000 by March this year, losing 65% of the value at its peak.\nIn December, the cryptocurrency started trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange financial futures market, providing a much more mainstream platform for betting on the future price of the currency. However, the extreme volatility of Bitcoin stock makes investing very risky. In addition to the usual supply and demand impacts, Bitcoin has had to contend with government bans, hacking fears and a steady stream of criticism from senior financial and political leaders. Is it legal?\nCertain types of gold are legal tender, specifically the gold Britannia and the gold Sovereign in the UK. It is unlikely you would want to spend them in your local supermarket, but as legal tender they don’t attract capital gains tax.\nBitcoins are only legal tender in Japan but that doesn’t mean it is an illegal currency. It can be used as payment in most other countries it just means the absence of protection for the buyer or seller. A few, including Ecuador, Bolivia and Algeria have declared it illegal though, and some countries like China have cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nAcross the world debates rage on the best way to regulate cryptocurrencies and the industry that has grown up around them. In the UK Bitcoin is unregulated and treated as a ‘foreign currency’ for corporation and income tax purposes. In March, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said cryptocurrency exchanges needed to be held to account in the same manner as the rest of the financial system, and the regulation of cryptocurrencies is currentlythe subject of a Treasury Select Committee enquiry. Selling up\nThe Pure Gold Company provides all buyers with a certificate of authenticity and a buyback guarantee which means clients can liquidate their gold as soon as they’re ready. The company sells the gold investment immediately to lock in live prices, and returns the funds within 12 working hours.\nYou need to go through an exchange to sell Bitcoins, and the process can be complicated and lengthy.Considering the price volatility, it isn’t a case of selling up when the market turns. Investors may be left with greater losses than they anticipated because of delays in the sale.There have also been reported cases of fraud because of the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency, so it really is both buyer and seller beware. When the cryptocurrency crashed in December, several online exchanges went down under the sheer volume of sellers and many investors were unable to sell quickly as the price plummeted.
