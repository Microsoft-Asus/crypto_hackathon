The cryptocurrency fell to a 6.5-week low of $7,142 on Bitfinex earlier today, having breached the 50-week moving average (MA) support for the very first time since 2015. Amid the continued drop in prices, though, the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday, indicating that the bears can be running out of steam and a short-term rally might be on the cards. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,210 – down 16.58 percent from the last Monday’s high of $8,644. 4-hour chart\nThe pennant breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart indicates the sell-off from the last Monday’s high of $8,644 has resumed and opened the doors to $6,800 (target as per the measured height method: pennant range subtracted from breakout price). The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are aligned in favor of a further drop in prices. Daily chart\nOn the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a short-term bearish setup. A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control. The relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices. Weekly chart\nThe first weekly close beneath the 50-week MA in nearly 3 years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended. The relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, whilst the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover. Plainly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there’s merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the market. Therefore, a minor corrective rally might be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal). View\nBTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the Apr 1 low of $6,425. An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800–$8,000. Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. In the mean time, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.\nChart image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, that strives for the highest abides by ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T23:42:14.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a39e709c551d3bc9f1009dc0bcc4f4799dd98fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXeB.sxHCQL5Sdvq.369arumYwd56O6j5AfRcH97gs.50DFyhF6APA_jzt1m9tw7TjItV7batz10w--", "site_full": "nehandaradio.com", "site": "nehandaradio.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/nehandaradio", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nehanda Radio", "title": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam", "title_full": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-05-28T14:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nehandaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62890, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a39e709c551d3bc9f1009dc0bcc4f4799dd98fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXeB.sxHCQL5Sdvq.369arumYwd56O6j5AfRcH97gs.50DFyhF6APA_jzt1m9tw7TjItV7batz10w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Esther Gomo", "published": "2018-05-28T14:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam", "text": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam On May 28, 2018 0 0\nSouth African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of R1 billion ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialised, police said on Friday.\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.

However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120 000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations. — Reuters .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:36:40.943+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ec17e1e24b8b6e52580453183e02e661e89764f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOL8dlPRCz7t8hz2tq7KMD8-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ec17e1e24b8b6e52580453183e02e661e89764f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOL8dlPRCz7t8hz2tq7KMD8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T14:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 28, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Cash Still Facing Decline after CNBC Feature GlobalCoinReport In the confusing world of Cryptocurrency markets, it is no surprise to find successful cryptocurrencies taking the tumble.

Base on knowledge bitcoin creates as digital currency, not a currency. There is a significant difference between currency and digital currency. If you say digital currency, it means required an internet connection. If you tell currency, it involves physical such as paper money or physical coins.

We turned on the Roku-looking machine in our San Francisco offices and allowed it to do its job. A small fortune was soon amassed, now worth around $100,000. Then, we lost the money. Forever.\nHere's what happened to WIRED's 13 Bitcoins—and to the millions of others that have faced the same fate. Stefan Antonowicz, WIRED's then-head of engineering, set up the miner. Robert McMillan, a former senior writer for WIRED (who now works at The Wall Street Journal ), then wrote about it. \"When we received that Butterfly miner, we had a new ethical question: What do you do with the proceeds of a review device that essentially prints money?\" says McMillan. First, it's probably worth explaining how WIRED accrued its six-figure Bitcoin fortune. While fiat currencies, like the dollar, rely on banks and government regulators, Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network monitored by an army of volunteer miners that run specialized software. Every 10 minutes, all the miners in the network race to solve a series of complex cryptographic math problems. The computers that win are awarded a slice of 12.5 new bitcoins. (That number halves every four years; it was 25 when we got our miner.) Usually, the fastest computers in the network solve the problems first. Over time, the puzzles have gotten harder, leading to a kind of computing-power arms race. Back when Bitcoin first launched, it was possible to mine coins using an everyday computer. These days, you'll need specialized hardware significantly more powerful than the Butterfly Labs miner WIRED had. Currently, there are about 17 million bitcoins in existence ; by the year 2140, all 21 million planned Bitcoins will have been mined. You can learn more about the process in our Guide to Bitcoin .) WIRED's miner essentially won the Bitcoin math lottery a couple of times, allowing it to generate a little over 13 coins into the network. Then, the staff had to figure out what to do with them. \"We had a very long conversation, over several weeks, about what to do with the money,\" says Michael Calore, a senior editor at WIRED who has been at the magazine since 2006. Some staff members argued the Bitcoin should be donated, or set aside for a charitable purpose in the future. Others said it had to be destroyed permanently. What was agreed upon was that the money shouldn't just sit there, because it could influence how the magazine reported on cryptocurrencies. \"I said we had to dump it and donate the money to charity soonest or we wouldn't be able to cover Bitcoin,\" says Adam Rogers, a deputy editor at WIRED. \"We had to disclose it in every story.\" Eventually, it was decided that the private key, which unlocks the Bitcoin wallet and allows the funds to be spent, should be destroyed. \"We talked about donating it to a journalism institution, or setting it aside as a scholarship. But we decided that if we gained any benefit from it at all, it would color our future coverage of bitcoin,\" says Calore. \"So we just destroyed the key, knowing full well that it could eventually be worth six or seven figures.\" McMillan then posted a story announcing the key had been ripped to pieces. Throwing Away the Key To deal in bitcoin, you need at least two different keys, one public and one private (newer security protocols allow you to add more private keys). Together, the combination of codes lets you trade Bitcoin without an intermediary like a bank. You can look up WIRED's public key to send us money, and then in theory, we could use our private key to access those funds—had we not destroyed it. It's extremely unlikely we could successfully guess the code: it's 64 digits long and no one remembers what it was. No additional copies of the private key exist, at least according to the people who were there. \"I didn't make a copy of the paper, or commit the 64 characters on it to memory,\" says Antonowicz, the technologist who set up the miner. The good news is that if someone did move the coins, the transaction would be public, allowing WIRED to see where they traveled to. In fact, you too can check out WIRED's lost Bitcoins right here . In theory, we might be able to recover the Bitcoin wallet from the hard drive where it was stored, but even that wouldn't be much help. \"There might have been a way to forensically recover the wallet—with the encrypted key—from my hard drive, but I shredded that particular drive years ago,\" says Antonowicz. Plus, even if the wallet was resurrected, it's encrypted. Breaking that protection via brute force would take an unimaginable amount of time. There are three times more possible combinations than there are atoms in the observable universe, by Antonowicz's count. \"Originally I was going to say that the closest metaphor I have is that we dropped a car key somewhere in the Atlantic, but I think it's closer for me to say we dropped the key somewhere between here and the Alpha Centauri,\" says Antonowicz. Recovering our bitcoins is essentially like trying to recover a photo album on a lost computer. Except not only did you get rid of the hard drive, you also protected the album in an encrypted folder with a 64-digit passcode that you threw away. Still, we wanted to make sure there was absolutely no way to get the bitcoins back. WIRED's editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, suggested that if we were able to recover the funds, they might go toward hiring a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. I reached out to the founder of Butterfly Labs, who didn't respond. I also contacted Mark Frauenfelder, a writer and the author of a WIRED article about how he recovered $30,000 worth of Bitcoin. He agrees we're screwed. \"If you lost your private keys I think it’s game over,\" he says. I also looked into a service that tries to crack cryptocurrency wallets via sheer brute force. But their services would be no help, since we don't have access to the hard drive itself. It looks like WIRED really did lose the money forever. The good news is we're far from alone. Lost and Never Found Chainalysis, a research firm that analyzes activity across different cryptocurrency markets, estimates that between 2.78 and 3.79 million, or between 17 and 23 percent of all bitcoins have been lost. That includes wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of Bitcoin who hasn't touched his estimated 1 million coins since 2011. “The number of lost coins over time will drop,” says Michael Gronager, the CEO and co-founder of Chainalysis. He argues that's because there’s more awareness of Bitcoin’s enduring value, even if the price wildly fluctuates. He also says that even if Satoshi were to reemerge, his activity wouldn't significantly impact the market because he wouldn't likely spend a large sum of Bitcoin at once. There are several ways you can lose Bitcoin. Like WIRED, you can simply lose track of your private key or your hard drive. One of the most famous cases of this is what happened to James Howells, an IT worker in London who lost 7,500 bitcoins, or around $56 million, when his laptop was thrown away in 2013. He reportedly wants to dig through five years of trash to unearth the computer. This is the most common way to lose Bitcoin; even Elon Musk tweeted that he forgot how to access a portion of a coin. You can also lose bitcoins by running buggy code or making software mistakes, though these instances are more rare. Last year, for example, someone forgot to collect their mining reward and burned 12.5 coins. In another similar incident , someone may have accidentally swapped a processing fee with the value of the transaction, resulting in nearly 300 coins lost. One time, someone even sent 2,600 coins to an incorrectly configured address , burning them into nonexistence. All of these examples come from BlockSci , a tool developed at Princeton University for analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain. It can be difficult to assess whether any given bitcoin is really lost for good. \"It's actually pretty difficult to say for certain. A lot of what we do is look at the big picture,\" says Harry Kalodner a PhD at Princeton who helped develop BlockSci. He says part of the problem is that you can rarely determine whether someone is just holding onto their Bitcoin, or whether they've definitively lost access to it. Since Bitcoin isn't controlled by any single authority, there's no one who can simply close your account. So what could WIRED have done, were we to do the whole thing again? Since 2013, Bitcoin has added a number of new, more sophisticated features. For one, we could have locked our coins away until a certain date. \"One Bitcoin feature that's been added is that it now supports time-locked coins, that makes them completely un-spendable until a set point in the future,\" says Kalodner. Like, say, May 2018, when the editor-in-chief could really use some money to hire another reporter. More Great WIRED Stories *Losing Bitcoin is shockingly easy.

Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created a course of residential treatment for \"crypto addicts\" to deal with the underlying issues and learn to live without it. Experts say the trading of digital currencies or assets such as Bitcoin can become a behavioural addiction, similar to online gambling with some users obsessively following minute-by-minute fluctuations in prices. The West Linton facility already runs drug and alcohol addiction programmes, but said it now treats cryptocurrency addiction by using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes. Castle Craig said there are no figures for the number of people addicted to cryptocurrency, but there are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system. Chris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, said: \"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. \"It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\" Some treatments at the centre will be led by Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict. He said introducing a life structure is key for addicts. \"Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem,\" therapist Mr Marini said. \"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. \"The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories.

What is Bitcoin? Everything you need to know about the cryptocurrency\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, said: \"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler.\n\"It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made.

FCA revels it is investigating dozens of ventures, and Poloniex tries to reassure legacy clients that their frozen funds are safe.\nAlso Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future\nPoloniex Responds to Complaints Poloniex, the cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts . Stories of legacy accounts getting locked have flooded social media and cryptocurrency forums over the last week. The company now tries to reassure these clients their funds are safe and explain the matter is required by law.\n“As soon as you submit this information, we will take steps to verify it and re-enable trading and transactions for your account. Please rest assured that your funds remain safe and accounted for while you complete this process – you can verify your holdings on the Balances page of your account throughout. Like all registered money services businesses, Poloniex is committed to compliance with all applicable law requiring identification and verification of its customers.”\nThe company also claims to have taken steps to increase the speed of the process. “We are happy to report that in the past 3 months we’ve seen a 33% increase in customers who are instantly verified, a 77% increase in customers who successfully pass our verification process, and an 85% decrease in customer waiting time for verification.”\n24 Crypto Ventures Under FCA Investigation Traders that are used to how things were before regulators started focusing on crypto platforms are understandably angry about the new hoops they have to jump to, but there is no doubt that the companies are under scrutiny and pressure to do so from regulators.\nThe UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is currently investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone related to companies operating in this field, according to FT . Responding to a freedom of information request from accountancy and consulting firm Moore Stephens, the FCA said on Friday that the purpose of the investigation is to determine whether these crypto companies might “be carrying on regulated activities that require FCA authorization”.\nICO Marketing Tragedy Ask.fm, an Irish company with its base of operations in Latvia and Ukraine, has sponsored four cryptocurrency enthusiasts to climb Mount Everest and place a wallet at the summit as part of its ICO marketing campaign. Lama Babu Sherpa, one of the Nepalese natives who helped the climbers, has reportedly been missing since May 14 th and is now presumed dead, according to AFP .\nThe team responded on Saturday: “We are now aware that one of the Sherpas who assisted our group amongst others, went missing during the descent. We wish to clarify conflicting media reports by stating that at the time of this statement being made we have not had any response from the relevant officials confirming the status of the missing Sherpa, and we are not therefore in a position to confirm if he is safe or otherwise. It would be insensitive to make such assumptions and we await, and urge the media to await, confirmation from the relevant authorities. There is no doubt that climbing Everest is challenging and dangerous…The last official update we received was that the condition and location of the missing Sherpa was unknown and it was not our place to make public statements which could have resulted in false information being circulated.”\nCrypto Champion And lastly, some happy news.

However, not much discussion goes around as to how blockchain would upend the role of advertising. Nevertheless, advertising industry will be one among the first that blockchain technology would disrupt. It digitizes touch points, makes digital payments, creates meaningful value, builds trust, and decentralizes advertising concepts. Marketers who recognize this will have a lucrative opportunity in front of them and an edge over others. Hence for salespeople and marketers, it is worth spending some time to understand the changes happening in this arena. Marketing agencies gain by accepting Bitcoin One of the challenges every business face is cash flow, and marketing agencies are not immune to it. With most agencies getting paid on a monthly basis, shortening the payment cycle can improve cash flow. Different ways such as providing clients with a menu of payment options to changing terms can accomplish this. Most agencies opt for the former, choosing to offer the option of paying via credit card, direct bank transfer or cheque. Although these are all very convenient, there are risks and costs associated with each. There are risks and costs associated with each payment type Credit card transactions For credit card transactions, merchant fees are typically around 3%, which can be high for clients on huge retainers. Moreover, credit card companies hold payments for up to three days before they transfer it. Direct bank transfer For direct bank transfer from one account to another using electronic methods, usually, there is a flat fee levied on each transaction, making them affordable for the sale sizes most agencies process. But while costs are less expensive, the time to process a bank-to-bank transfer is longer. Payment using cheque With cheques, although there is no cost to process them, there is a significant delay in getting paid. From the time it takes to mail it to the time the bank clears the payment, it can take a couple of weeks to see the amount hit the bank account. Payment option challenges Both direct bank transfer and credit card transactions sometimes incur disputes or chargebacks from customers. They may claim that the charge was unauthorized, false, or that the bank misappropriated the information of the account. When this happens, marketing agencies have no choice but to absorb the financial loss. Also, organizations that accept direct bank transfer or credit card payments are obligated to safeguard the payment information of the clients, and if they mishandle this, it can be a severe risk. Bitcoin Bitcoin offers solutions For marketing agencies struggling to increase cash flow and reduce risks, Bitcoin is the solution. There is no risk in accepting Bitcoins but an advantage regarding improving the cash flow. Since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009, it has grown to become the most extensively used cryptocurrency in the world. Vendors including Amazon, Overstock.com, Dish Network, Target, Dell Computers, PayPal, eBay, Expedia, the Sacramento Kings, Home Depot, Kmart and Sears now accept it. Bitcoin payment solution also has some financial benefits and less tangible advantages. Great financial benefits Marketing agencies that get paid via Bitcoin can either accept actual Bitcoins or merely turn them into cash using a third-party payment processor, much like credit cards do. From a risk standpoint, the former approach is much safer because there is virtually no exchange risk when using a third-party processor. There are no processing fees unless the transactions exceed a high amount. There are no chargebacks either because Bitcoins are push transactions, meaning the buyer initiates them. Less tangible benefits Marketing agencies should consider accepting Bitcoins because there are non-financial benefits. Agencies get paid faster because payments are processed immediately without any delay. Also, the agencies do not need to safeguard or hold sensitive customer payment information such as bank account or credit card numbers because of the push nature of the business. Therefore, the marketing agencies are not at risk of confidential information being leaked, stolen or hacked if it experiences a data breach. And converting them into cash eliminates the risk of fraudsters taking the Bitcoins through a cyber attack. Easy payment form Chief amongst the reasons to accept Bitcoin, as one of the accepted forms of payment, is customer satisfaction. Marketing agencies can allow their clients to pay for the services in the way that is most convenient and easiest for them thereby offering them more options. Capture lucrative customers While people have not widely adopted Bitcoin the way they have done with credit cards it is prevalent amongst high-tech and dot-com firms, which can be very profitable customers for the agencies. There is a growing but small cadre of advertising and marketing agencies that are accepting Bitcoins such as Quintain Marketing, 5ivecanons in Jacksonville, Florida, and DiMassimo Goldstein in New York. Because there are so few of marketing agencies that are taking Bitcoin, those that do are enjoying a significant amount of press coverage. Bitcoin Processing Bitcoin payment Blockchain has various uses, but it becomes technical when it comes to how it works and what it is. When someone wants to pay using Bitcoins, they must initiate it using a private key. The company or person who accepts the payment can either use a third-party to convert the Bitcoins into cash or withdraw it in the form of Bitcoins. Once Bitcoin has been initiated and processed, it cannot be refunded or taken back. Get set go Getting started is easy and fast as there are plenty of companies helping businesses that want to get Bitcoin set up as a payment option. These companies help businesses to navigate the unfamiliar process of establishing a Bitcoin account. They will then connect the company with a third-party processor that will convert the Bitcoins into cash, which then gets deposited into the bank account. Among the most popular payment processors include Bitpay, Coinbase, and GoCoin. To help simplify the process, take some time to check out their sites, and if possible, work with a local agency. That way, there will be someone to turn to for help for quick answers to questions in this unchartered territory. Mass adoption challenges The most significant problem with the mass adoption of Bitcoin is that people do not have a clear understanding of how it works. They cannot even comprehend what it is. Furthermore, Bitcoins have been used to facilitate black market or illegal transactions because they are non-refundable, difficult to trace and are not regulated by any central authority. As a result, the news in the mainstream media channels surrounding Bitcoin has been negative. This bad publicity has led to the hesitation on the part of many companies to accept it as a payment form. Coming up next Blockchain is the new change on the horizon. It is already in the financial world. But the uses of blockchain are far more wide reaching. It is shaking digital advertising firms. It is also becoming prevalent in many other sectors in all industries including supply chain, corporate responsibility, and fashion designing. To accept Bitcoins, all the marketing firm needs is a Bitcoin button at the checkout and a digital wallet. It works like a cycle whereby the publishers and users receive tokens when they view the ads. Submit a Comment Your email address will not be published.

Investors, stock traders, and entrepreneurs are among the people who are interested in the Bitcoin information. For those who don’t understand what a bitcoin is: it is a type of currency which is digital.\nUnlike other currencies, the bitcoin currency is not controlled by any bank, centralized authority or even the government. Bitcoin is normally developed by people who are known as “miners.” The Miners are known to use the computer to mine the bitcoin; they also use specialized hardware that aids in the process of bitcoin transactions.\nTechprenuers have come up with tools known as bitcoin calculators that allow someone to convert any amount of money which is in any currency to and from bitcoin. There are a lot of things many people don’t understand about bitcoin, in this article we discuss some of the things which one needs to know about Bitcoin. IMAGE: PIXABAY Bitcoin Origin\nThe origins of bitcoin can be traced back in 2008. The creator of this cryptocurrency went by the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. He published the concept proof for Bitcoin in the year 2008. This proof later went on to be published in one of the cryptocurrency mailing lists in the year 2009.\nIn the Year 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto left the bitcoin project and then disappeared never to be heard of. Despite his disappearance, other tech-developers picked up his work and continued the development of the cryptocurrency. The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of bitcoin, has never been confirmed. You Can Spend Bitcoins To Purchase Anything\nPeople have continued to use bitcoins to buy things that they may have bought using normal currencies. May 22, 2010, is the date when the first transaction involving bitcoin was reported. The transaction happened when a certain programmer by the name Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. As of today, 10,000 bitcoins are worth over $100 Million. If you don’t understand the price of a bitcoin in your currency, you can always use the online bitcoin calculators. Bitcoin Is Not Owned By Anyone\nTo understand bitcoin more precisely is good to think of it like email. Anybody across the world can use an email but there is no person in the world, or even company that can say is in charge of it. The Banks or even the government cannot block someone from receiving bitcoins anywhere in the world; this is because the transactions of bitcoin are irreversible. Bitcoin Calculator\nA bitcoin calculator is a type of software tools that have been developed to convert any amount to and from bitcoin. The amount is from any preferred world currency, and the conversion rates that are based on the bitcoin calculator are usually based on the live price of the bitcoin.\nThe bitcoin price has been on the rise for the last couple of years.

There are two bearish trend lines formed with resistances at $7,400 and $7,510 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair remains at a risk of more losses if it breaks the $7,150 support level. Bitcoin price is moving further into the bearish zone below $7,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must remain above $7,000 to avoid a sharp decline.\nBitcoin Price Analysis There were a couple of rejections noted around $7,500 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair started a downside move and declined below the $7,400 and $7,300 support levels. It even settled below the $7,400 pivot and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined below the $7,260 low.\nThe current price action suggests a downside break below $7,260 with a bearish angle. At the moment, the price is testing the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high. If the price breaks the $7,150 level, there could be more losses towards the $7,000 level. The 1.618 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high is at $7,020 to act as a support. Further below this, the price could decline towards $6,800. On the upside, there are two bearish trend lines formed with resistances at $7,400 and $7,510 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price may struggle to break the $7,300 and $7,400 resistance levels. Only a close above $7,500 could clear the path for a bullish trend in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well below the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,020\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,400\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Upsides Remain Limited appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T12:34:47.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8088e9f55ee45cf16da4f5caf458fa6715d5816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb32QdsgBPZvs5vp0g6zDqq97FeXrryT66BbCA1zFAtojH1BsBXTlTh1S04K6i22FoxVjKR2y87yYWDc6Eod70zb6omrXW.nuqNw--", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.americanbankingnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin Green Trading Down 25.7% Over Last 7 Days (BITG)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Green Trading Down 25.7% Over Last 7 Days (BITG)", "published": "2018-05-28T12:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2604.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8088e9f55ee45cf16da4f5caf458fa6715d5816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb32QdsgBPZvs5vp0g6zDqq97FeXrryT66BbCA1zFAtojH1BsBXTlTh1S04K6i22FoxVjKR2y87yYWDc6Eod70zb6omrXW.nuqNw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-28T12:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Green Trading Down 25.7% Over Last 7 Days (BITG)", "text": "\nBitcoin Green (CURRENCY:BITG) traded 2.9% lower against the U.S. dollar during the one day period ending at 0:00 AM ET on May 27th.

This has led to an improvement in the risk sentiment and this is expected to support the risk markets like the stock and crypto markets for the short term. We believe that these kind of fundamentals would support the crypto market but this is a market that is still developing and hence nothing is for sure at this point of time.\nBitcoin 4H More The ETH price have once again slipped below the $600 region and continue to be weak, in line with the rest of the crypto market. Unless the overall sentiment surrounding this market begins to pick up, we are likely to see the ETH prices continue to be weak in the short term.\nForecast Looking ahead to the rest of the day, as we had mentioned earlier, we believe that the ETH and the BTC prices would consolidate for today with a slight bullish bias but with the bears still in control and the prices still below the broken support region, we do not expect any major gains.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: Crude Oil Price Update – Weekly Closing Price Reversal Top Signals Major Shift in Momentum GBPUSD Opens Flat for the Week As Both Sides Are on Holiday Loonie Fails To Cover Ground Despite Holiday Thinned Market US Dollar Index (DX) Futures Technical Analysis – Next Trigger Point for Upside Breakout is 94.42 Bitcoin Bulls Jump Ship to Leave the Bears at the Helm How to Maximise Cashback on Your Credit Card", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbpusd-opens-flat-week-sides-holiday-505055", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/why-bitcoin-cash-is-better-than-bitcoin-451179", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/how-to-short-bitcoin-a-complete-guide-458638", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pEn3kUzy41oHFquz6Lr4vw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/c0000431d9978b9c3f067adc230d0525", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/us-dollar-index-dx-futures-technical-analysis-next-trigger-point-for-upside-breakout-is-94-42-505016", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/how-to-buy-bitcoin-cash-428434", "https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/bitcoin-bulls-jump-ship-leave-bears-helm-505040", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pEn3kUzy41oHFquz6Lr4vw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/c0000431d9978b9c3f067adc230d0525);", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/loonie-fails-cover-ground-despite-holiday-thinned-market-505092", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/maximise-cashback-credit-card-505089", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-ethereum-price-forecast-btc-prices-hang-505001&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/crude-oil-price-update-weekly-closing-price-reversal-top-signals-major-shift-in-momentum-505037", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-ethereum-price-forecast-btc-prices-hang-505001"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:05:40.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57e9249dd9c174da6c6a81c133b68c379d72e7c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOeRfZ1ZMS2jxNAVa7kKJus-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T12:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57e9249dd9c174da6c6a81c133b68c379d72e7c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOeRfZ1ZMS2jxNAVa7kKJus-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T12:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 28, 2018 NEWS Over $12B wiped out from cryptocurrency market in two hours; Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Ripple are ...

London mosque now accepts bitcoin Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

He explained :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they're going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nNevertheless, the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hurting this month. After reaching highs of roughly $20,000 late last year, Bitcoin has fallen more than 50 percent in 2018 — and worries remain that the hemorrhaging is far from over. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,220.00, with some analysts fearing prices below $6,000 are likely on their way.\nStill, Bogart remains bullish on Bitcoin. He told CNBC:\nBut when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing. Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely.\nAltcoins Are 'Over-Promising and Under-Delivering' Bogart's bullish sentiment does not extend to altcoins, however. He told CNBC that the majority of cryptocurrencies available to trade are \"over-promising and under-delivering,\" adding:\nMeanwhile, you have a few [cryptocurrencies] that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\nThe venture capitalist also told CNBC that he recommends selling fan favorites Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), IOTA, (MIOTA), and NEO (NEO). \"A lot of those tokens are overvalued,\" Bogart explained. \"They could be go [sic] up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.\"\nThe partner at Blockchain Capital is also cautious in regards to Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and dominant launchpad for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Bogart explained that the sheer amount of ICOs built on top of Ethereum is cause for concern, particularly if those ICOs don't succeed.\nOn the other hand, Bogart recommends holding the other major players like Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS (EOS) under current market conditions.\nDo you share Bogart's belief that Bitcoin is still a strong buy? Do you think investors should be unloading their altcoins, or do you think such a move would be foolish at this point?

In 2013, when the price of BTC surpassed the $100 mark, Howells started to search for the thumb drive which he used back in 2009 to store private keys to the 7,500 BTC he had mined. He then recalled that instead of throwing the empty thumb drive, he mistakenly threw away the thumb drive with his private keys. “I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush. Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty, and the other contained my bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information,” said Howells. Bitcoin is a unique digital asset because it forces its users to take responsibility over their funds and eliminates the possibility of central institutions or third party service providers gaining access to user funds. One downside of this aspect of BTC is that if and when a user loses private keys to a wallet, it is impossible to recover the funds, however large the amount may be. After realising that he had thrown away millions of dollars, Howells admitted that he had felt physically sick. Howells stated: “I looked up the price, did the calculation . . . and thought, ‘S – – t. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.” Bitcoin is Undervalued Millions of bitcoin are permanently lost from its immutable blockchain network because of cases like the loss of funds of Howells. A study done by Chainalysis , a blockchain-focused digital forensics company, found that 3.79 million BTC are potentially lost permanently and can no longer be re-obtained. 3.79 million is more than 18 percent of the maximum supply of BTC, 21 million. Given that the price of bitcoin is calculated by dividing the market valuation of the digital asset by its circulating supply, when the supply of bitcoin maxes out at 21 million, the price of bitcoin should be 18 percent higher than its actual price. “On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity. Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available – just look at exchange behavior,” Chainalysis enior economist Kim Gauer said.

Keep in mind that there are many coins out there but bitcoin and litecoin are the only 2 that are proven to be stable and work flawlessly since their network has been going for years and years. Many of The most hyped projects don’t even have a working product. They may eventually be great but there are always bumps along its development. Ether has been shown to have multiple bugs, hacks, and not as decentralized but still much much further along than most. Good luck it’s a jungle out there that’s for sure.

Now commuters riding the Prague Metro can purchase digital assets at various locations spread out across the fifth busiest metro system in Europe. The technical picture on Bitcoin looks bearish and I saw no signs of any larger demand.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price broke an intraday bearish flag, which is a sign that sellers are in control.

Xapo është i njohur për listën e gjatë të klientëve dhe shqetësimeve të mëdha të sigurisë, por është edhe më i njohur – sa para digjitale gjenden në këta bunkerë?\nKlientët e tyre thonë se janë rreth 10 miliardë dollarë në bitcoin, por është e vështirë të dihet vlera e saktë, pasi çmimi i bitcoin ndryshon. Në duart e tyre gjendet çelësi për rreth 7 për qind të tregut të bitcoin në botë, shifër kjo e jashtëzakonshme për kompaninë ‘e vjetër’ vetëm katër vjet, që sipas këtyre vlerësimeve ka mbi 98 për qind të depozitave në 5.670 banka në SHBA.\nRuajtësit e ‘gjuetisë’ botërore kanë një rregullore të veçantë. Biznesi i tyre zviceran mbikëqyr Shoqatën e Standardeve të Shërbimeve Financiare, i cili kontrollon anëtarët për të gjetur nëse ato janë në përputhje me rregullat e rrepta të pastrimit të parave.\nShërbimi iu ofrua gjithashtu klientëve amerikanë nëpërmjet një korporate Delaware të regjistruar në Rrjetin e Përmbarimit të Krimit Financiar të Departamentit të Thesarit të SHBA dhe të licencuar në disa vende.\nBesimi është Casares – një sipërmarrës i njohur për pseudonimin “Pacienti Zero”, i cili ka nxitur interesin e Silicon Valley për bitcoin – të fituara nga ndjekësit e tij dhe kompanitë e mëdha të investimeve si Grayscale dhe CoinShares.\n“Ata që nuk kanë çelësat për pasurinë digjitale vetë, kanë dorëzuar çelësat për Xapo”, tha Ryan Radloff i CoinShares, i cili në kutitë e tij fsheh më shumë se 500 milionë dollarë në vlerë të bitcoins.\nLista e mbështetësve të tyre, miliarderëve, përfshin LinkedIn, të udhëhequr nga bashkëthemeluesi i tyre Reid Hoffman dhe ish-tregtari i Wall Street, Mike Novogratz, i cili është aktualisht në procesin e krijimit të bankës së tij të kripto-tregtare. Ata parashikojnë se bitcoin do të mbetet aty përgjithmonë, dhe frika e tyre më e madhe është – vjedhja e tij.\nRregulli i parë dhe ndoshta më i rëndësishëm për zotërimin e një bitcoin është të sigurojë një çelës privat në veçanti – një kod që lejon përdorimin e bitcoin. Nëse çelësi është kapur nga hajdutët, në këtë moment mund të mbeteni pa kurrgjë dhe shanset që bitcoins e vjedhur do t’ju kthehen janë pothuajse zero.\nNëse çelësi juaj është i lidhur me një pajisje me internet, edhe pse është shumë praktike, është në të vërtetë shumë e rrezikshme, pasi hakerët kanë provuar të jenë shumë të shkathët dhe do të marrin të dhëna pa asnjë problem.\nAlternativa më e popullarizuar është një ‘magazinim i ftohtë’, çelësi i të cilit është në një pajisje jashtë linje – USB. Por rreziku mbetet, hakerët dinakë janë në gjendje të vënë kurthe në kompjuter për të siguruar qasje në ‘ruajtje’, në pikën e lidhjes me internetin, shkruan Bloomberg.\nDisa kriminelë i janë kthyer qasjes tradicionale të grabitjes, që përfshin thyerjen dhe rrëmbimin. Vetëm për shkak të çështjeve të ndryshme të sigurisë, pronarët e pasur të bitcoins fshehin identitetin e tyre, rrisin sigurinë e shtëpive të tyre dhe madje trajnojnë një lloj vetëmbrojtjeje.\nXapo ofron një zgjidhje për të ruajtur bitcoins të vlefshme thellë në male me një rrjet të fortë sigurie.\n“Ata janë të parët që njohën rëndësinë e rolit të kujdestarisë dhe funksioneve të sigurisë”, tha Hoffman, firma e investimeve të të cilit Greylock Partners në Xapo investoi 20 milionë dollarë në 2014, vetëm disa vjet pasi Casares e nxiti atë duke blerë bitcoin e parë.\nNë Xapo zgjat rreth dy ditë për të tërheqë bitcoins dhe procesi përfshin kontrollimin e identitetit të klientit dhe autorizimin e kërkesës përpara se të miratohen transaksionet me çelësa privatë nga vende të ndryshme.\nNë mënyrë që transaksioni të autorizohet, kërkohet miratimi nga tre palë të ndryshme. Kompania gjithashtu u ofron klientëve mundësinë për të shitur dhe blerë bitcoins dhe kanë krijuar kartën e parë të debitit për shpenzimet.\nMisioni i Casares është bitcoin. Ky argjentinas u lind në fermën e deleve në rajonin e Patagonisë argjentinase dhe nga më të hershmit përjetoi fuqinë e inflacionit në lëkurën e tij. Ishte pikërisht pasiguria financiare që e bëri atë të krijonte një sërë startesh financiare dhe teknologjike që i siguruan miliona para se të fillonte të merrej me bitcoin.\nAi shiti 75 për qind të Patagonisë, portal financiar në Amerikën Latine për 529 milionë dollarë në vitin 2000 dhe Lemon digjital për 43 milionë dollarë 13 vjet më vonë, të gjitha në mënyrë që të përqendrohej në valuta digjitale. Ai tashmë ishte një pronar i madh bitcoin, të cilit i beson jashtëzakonisht shumë.

With the help of a couple of experts, we try to unravel the complicated world of cryptocurrency and answer the burning question: what is Bitcoin?\nRead more: Investing for women — what you need to know\nSo, what are cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies are digital forms of money. Think of a cryptocurrency as a line of code that has been given a monetary value. This means that you can’t physically pick it up like a R10 note or R2 coin and put it in your handbag. It only exists online in a digital wallet.\nThe first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows who Satoshi is, whether they are male or female or if it was created by one person or a group. Their aim was to develop the first electronic cash system and they did just that with Bitcoin going live for the first time in 2009. Since then, a whole host of new cryptocurrencies have been added such as Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano… The list goes on.\nYou’ll often hear people refer to cryptocurrencies as ‘decentralised’ or ‘deregulated’ forms of money, because they aren’t kept in a bank or controlled by a government.\nWhy should I be interested? It’s all everyone is talking about. If it’s not the rise and fall of the Bitcoin price, it’s the discussion about someone who knows someone who heard about a neighbour who became a multi-millionaire overnight.\nBesides the skyrocketing price being all that everyone talks about at dinner parties and braais, it offers some interesting new developments in technology. All cryptocurrencies operate on a system called blockchain, which is a sophisticated way of completing and verifying transactions. It uses extremely complicated mathematical techniques to verify that a Bitcoin moved from one person to another. This means that when you buy or sell a cryptocurrency, you’ll be cutting out the traditional middleman: the bank.\nRead more: 10 of the best money saving (and money making) apps\nHow do I get my hands on a Bitcoin or piece of Ethereum? There are two ways that people can get into cryptocurrencies, says Richard Green and Matt Kriel of Mr Crypto Technologies. The first is to become a cryptocurrency miner and mine for Bitcoins, Ethereum and the like. According to Matt and Richard, you would need to solve complicated mathematical problems using highly specialised computer software. If like us you already have a day job and can’t be bothered to buy a super computer, then the other way of getting your hands on a cryptocurrency is to buy it.\nRead more: Why it’s time to stop using the word ‘busy’\nHow can I buy cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin, Ethereum and a wide variety of other cryptocurrencies can be bought on the local exchange, Luno , says Brad Goldman, CEO of Bitfund. “Using Luno you are able to make an EFT deposit and exchange those rands for cryptocurrencies very easily.” Before you can start buying and selling cryptocurrencies, you’ll need to create a Luno account, and verify your identity and address using various documents. Once all these formal boxes have been checked you can do an EFT deposit and start adding Ethereum or Bitcoin to your online wallet. You can convert your cryptocurrency back into rands at any stage and send the money back into your traditional banking account.\nIf you’re not keen on the idea of buying your own Bitcoins, there are businesses out there who will help you make the purchase and manage these for you. Richard and Matt’s company Mr Crypto Technologies and Brad’s Bitfund are just two of these kinds of companies.\nThe methods in which you can buy or sell cryptocurrencies is growing with a company even offering an ATM-like service outside the Northwold Spar in Randburg. Vendibit have created an ATM that allows you to purchase various cryptocurrencies with rands.\nWhere can I store my Bitcoins? The quickest answer is into an online wallet, but the technical one is that you never truly have a cryptocurrency in it. A wallet just stores and protects your balance; you are then able to access your wallet at any stage using your unique private key. There are a variety of wallets out there, but not all wallets have been made equal. Each of them comes with their own pros and cons.\nDesktop wallet You can download a desktop wallet programme to your computer. The plus side of this is that your wallet can’t be accessed from any other computer. The downside? If your computer is stolen, gets a virus or is hacked, your Bitcoins will be lost forever.\nSome examples of these desktop wallet programmes include Armory, Bitcoin Core, Electrum or Jaxx.\nHardware wallet These come in the form of a hard drive or USB, and have been described as one of the most secure wallets you can get. When plugged into your computer, the device can perform cryptocurrency transactions, but once it’s removed, your Bitcoins are then stored safely offline.\nA hardware wallet is not your everyday USB that you find lying around the house or got given as part of a work gift. Trezor or Ledger Nano wallets have been modified to include additional security and can easily set you back over R2 000.\nMobile wallet Much like a desktop wallet, this one lives on your phone and can perform transactions through an app. However, if your phone goes missing, so do your Bitcoins. Mobile wallets are also prone to hackers.\nElectrum, Mycelium and Coinomi are just a few of the mobile wallets available.\nOnline or web wallets These wallets store your cryptocurrency information on a cloud and allow you to access your wallet from anywhere making it super convenient. However, because its a website that holds all your information, you run the risk of you or the company being hacked.\nLuno is one of the many web wallets out there.\nRead more: 5 wealth-building habits every woman needs to know\nWhat are the benefits? Because cryptocurrencies are not run by any bank or government, the transfer fees are much lower, says Brad. “As a South African wanting to pay someone in America (or any other country) the traditional method would be to perform a SWIFT transfer. This transfer can take over a week in some cases and the costs are high (often over R200).” He says that transferring a Bitcoin would happen in a matter of seconds and cost a lot less than a normal bank transfer.\nHe also says that cryptocurrencies can be bought or sold by anyone. You just need an internet connection.\nYou also have complete control over your funds, so no government or financial institution can freeze your funds without your private key.\nThe other great thing is that cryptocurrencies are not tied to currencies like the dollar, pound or yen, and increase and decrease independently. “For example, bad news in South African politics won’t lower the value of your Bitcoin,” says Brad.\nWhat’s the downside? If you’ve been following Bitcoin’s meteoric rise and catastrophic dips in the news, then you’ll know that it is volatile. And this applies to all cryptocurrencies. For example, in December 2017, Bitcoin sat at $17 900 before falling to $6 200 in February 2018.\nAs cryptocurrencies have gained in popularity, more and more scammers and fraudulent currencies have moved into the industry. Brad says that it’s important to do your due diligence before making your first investment.\nIf anyone gets a hold of your private key and takes your cryptocurrencies out of your wallet, there’s no one to help you get it back. Because cryptocurrencies are not run by a central authority, there’s no fraud centre who’ll help you.\nDisclaimer: Please be aware that any information presented in the story above is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice.
