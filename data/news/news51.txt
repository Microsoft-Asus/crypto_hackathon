Those early enthusiasts waxed poetic about it as an alternative measure of value created exclusively for the upcoming digital age and well protected by the latest cryptographic mechanisms.\nSure enough, Bitcoin did seem to have unique features that play in its favor with confronted with gold. The number of Bitcoins is limited, its blockchain is decentralized, all transactions and emission are transparent; it can adapt to the network environment of the future; it’s completely independent and can’t be subjected to any censure; it knows no borders; finally, it’s novel and bold. And while some of its early adopters may have overestimated the potential of these features, this picture wasn’t too far from the truth.\nNevertheless, now that years have passed and so much has happened, cryptocurrency as a class has unfortunately degenerated into a speculative, highly volatile asset – and BTC is no exception. It’s now fashionable to point out how few practical applications cryptocurrencies have found in the real financial sector of the economy. Bitcoin never became what it was intended to be according to its white paper ; at the same time, it has acquired features of something it definitely wasn’t designed to become. Today, cryptocurrencies are surrounded by hype, by endless pumps and dumps; they are a way to make a quick buck out of nothing, not a technology bound to disrupt global finance. The recent emergence of crypto CFDs has demonstrated how far derivatization of the crypto industry has gone.\nSomehow in the process of this race, a potential bubble has appeared. The two conflicting roles played by cryptocurrencies – as a revolutionary technology and as just another derivative – have become so intertwined in the minds of the audience that diagnosing the actual issue is now tricky. In our post-truth era, each side sees cryptocurrency as only one of these two things. So what next?\nIf we accept the original point of few – Bitcoin as digital gold, as a revolution in finance – then the cryptocurrency has to be adopted by a majority in the society. The famous Metcalf law can serve as a criterion here. However, right now we are balancing in a point of uncertainty: expectations are fragmented. There are some true believers (hodlers), there are lots of speculators, there are those who perfect and promote the technology out of pure enthusiasm, and then there is a vast ocean of people who have never, ever used bitcoin.\nThe bad news is that we are now seriously stuck in the speculative stage, which can kill Bitcoin as a technology. If the BTC bubble were to deflate significantly (causing a chain reaction of deflation for the rest of altcoins), the situation would improve: only tech people (who are doing the real work) and pragmatists would be left in the game, casting the speculating hordes out. This is the issue: expensive and growing Bitcoin has attracted multitudes of people whose only desire is to get rich quick.\nThe good news is there is still some potential for the Bitcoin to take a healthier course. For instance, its price has already fallen a lot (now it’s roughly 60% of the historical record), which helped dampen the quick buck euphoria; new regulations have improved its legal standing, and the gradual unfolding and growth of Lightning network nodes will soon solve the Bitcoin scaling problem.\nOf course, nobody today would want to use the “old” Bitcoin – the way it was 5 years ago. Indeed, who would now use the first edition of the iPhone? The new Bitcoin is among the top 5 most active projects on GitHub. Thanks to its new features and related projects like rootstock, atomic swaps, LN, etc., it turned into a locomotive of the crypto industry – at least if its record price and market influence are any indications. All this instills hope for the future of Bitcoin. So what are we left with?\nThe key conclusion: for McAfee’s scenario of the Bitcoin price to become reality, the leading cryptocurrency must be reimagined. The public has to stop seeing it as a speculative asset and begin to perceive it as a foundational technology of a new age. As long as Bitcoin is implemented ever more and becomes more popular, its price will start growing again. However, it will be different, higher-quality growth based on real demand and a growing number of transactions.\nTo summarize: the final battle – and a possible triumph of crypto – is still ahead of us. In the next few years, the fate of Bitcoin will be decided in our own minds.

The scandal resulted in the departure of Chief Executive Ian Narev.\nCBA denies knowingly breaching AML laws, arguing that a single coding error had led to the failure to report the 53,506 transactions. However, they did admit responsibility for a lack of proper due diligence.\n“Our agreement today is a clear acknowledgment of our failures and is an important step towards moving the bank forward. On behalf of Commonwealth Bank, I apologise to the community for letting them down,” said CBA current chief executive, Matt Comyn. Illegal transactions: Fiat vs. Crypto\nThis news is particularly ironic considering the accusations by the mainstream media (and Bill Gates) that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used primarily for money laundering and funding terrorism.\nStudies conducted by Colombia University Economics professor Edgar Feige have already disproven these claims, citing that almost 50% of the world’s hard currency is utilized to make Illicit transactions like drug and arms trafficking.\nA recent panel held by the US Senate Judiciary on modernizing anti-money laundering laws also found that only a small percentage of illicit activity spending is done through cryptocurrency.\nThe fact remains that cash is offline, and therefore more difficult to trace. Digital cash is recorded on a centralized database, where institutions with their own agendas can easily hide these transactions from the authorities.\nBy contrast, the immutability of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain actually makes it harder to move money around without a trace.\nA recent study by Qatar University and Hamad Bin Khalifa University revealed that unmasking the users behind these transactions often requires nothing more than a wallet address and a Google search. Qatar University researcher, Husam Al Jawaheri, explained:\nThe retroactive operation security of Bitcoin is low. When things are recorded in the blockchain, you can go back in history and reveal this information, to break the anonymity of users.\nThe best drug traffickers can hope for at the moment is using coins like Monero to mask their transactions, however, even Monero has its vulnerabilities. CBA Implementing Blockchain?\nJust 2 years ago, the now-ousted CBA executive Ian Narev acknowledged blockchain’s potential to be “transformational” for customers and in reducing costs, while perhaps not also recognizing its capabilities as an immutable ledger for the Bank itself.\nIt’s safe to say that a CBA ledger built on the blockchain would’ve made it much more difficult to conceal 53,506 transactions, saving AUSTRAC a lot of time and money investigating the breach.\nTo date, CBA has spent more than $400 million on anti-money laundering compliance measures.\nDo you think the bank would consider using Blockchain technology to improve compliance with AML an d counter-terrorism financing laws?

Total capitalization has been pushed back over $350 billion as $20 billion extra entered crypto markets over the weekend. Bitcoin has climbed slightly trading at $7,700 and Ethereum has made good gains of around 4.5% trading at around $620. Most of the altcoins are in the green during Asian trade this morning, but only one in double figures. The one leading the pack at the moment is Bitcoin Cash.\nCoinmarketcap is reporting a 10.3% gain for BCH. Currently trading at $1,194 Bitcoin Cash is up from $1,085 this time yesterday. Over the past seven days BCH has made solid gains of 20% – this is impressive when compared to BTC’s gains which have only been 4% for the same period. On the month however Bitcoin Cash has taken a tumble with all other cryptos, falling from $1,475 by 19% to its current price. Against its big brother Bitcoin Cash is up 9% on the day to 15503300 satoshis. On the week however gains have been marginal as the satoshi level was very similar this time last Monday.\nGains have been steady and not pumps, indicating that there has been no single announcement to cause them. However a new version of HandCash, a Bitcoin Cash wallet app designed for ease of use and near field communications, was released over the weekend. The NFC feature allows people in close proximity to transfer funds without using wallet addresses or QR codes. The new update allows users to send and received just by mentioning the recipient’s ‘handle’ further simplifying and speeding up the transfer process.\nBitcoin Cash is traded on all major exchanges however OKEx is currently at the top of the list for volume. Total trade volume for BCH has increased almost 30% in 24 hours from $700 million to just over $900 million. Its market cap is currently $20.5 billion, $7 billion less than XRP in third spot.\nTotal crypto market capitalization has climbed for the fifth day in a row indicating a possible return of the bulls. The level currently stands at $352 billion, up 2.6% on the day. It has been a bullish week with total market cap climbing 8% since the same time last Monday. The monthly view is still a downtrend however. Other altcoins enjoying good gains during the morning’s Asian trading session include XRP up 8%, VeChain up 10%, and Lisk up 7%.\nMore on Bitcoin Cash can be found here: https://www.bitcoincash.org/\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.

Regulators are flip-flopping all over the place – blowing hot and cold everywhere; consistency seems to be sporadic, continuity non-existent…what’s to be done?\nIt all seemed to be going so well: bailouts from the taxpayer, austerity, bigger bubbles in assets and stocks, the rape of Greece and others for pennies for the benefit of EU big banks…\nThen, out of nowhere, a little-known coterie of nerds grew and grew with a breakthrough technology and suddenly started posing an existential threat in the long term. What’s even worse is the fact that the technology is very disruptive and can’t be hijacked, and the ‘nice’ bits for the powers-that-be can’t really be effectively stripped out from the destabilizing ones.\nTruly a horror-show if you are a bankster or someone who has a strong personal alignment with the status quo. Fast forward to what we are seeing now – a situation where people are either (a): mono-maniacally calm or running around with their hair on fire screaming that the sky is falling and that Darknet money nerds will start selling their kids and stealing everything that isn’t nailed down or (b): people who are trading ‘rat-poison’ or ‘harvested dead baby brains’ (Buffett and Munger).\nAll this being played out against a geopolitical backdrop within which the balance of power in the world is undergoing tectonic changes, the likes of which are only seen every few generations or even more rarely. And so the crypto-bashing plays out on our websites, in our newspapers, on TV screens and social media. The bans go in, then get reversed etc.; the FUD monster truly seems to be hiding under every mainstream media pundit’s bed – and in every country too.\nWhen you add in all the economic horror headlines in the world of fiat money, and the wars and austerity and misery, it makes for a very unsettling picture.\nHowever, within all these things ONE thing is a constant: the fact that things are changing, everywhere, and in every area.\nAnd the world will never be the same again.\nJoking aside, this is something that bears examination and analysis. What does the future hold in this area? Can we gaze ahead and maybe tease out a few possible directions and possibilities? Let’s begin… The Landscape At Present\nA variety of approaches are being explored in various countries and are driven by varying levels of hysteria and engagement. There seems to be a mood of hysteria and enthusiasm, which oscillates and fluctuates wildly; the one consistent thing is that there is no consistency in most places. The industry is young, and many governments are fluctuating wildly between a desire for the benefits of blockchain in terms of its potential for growth with concomitant benefits for control (immutability etc.). which is balanced with an existential fear and loathing of its inherent capabilities for disintermediation, disruption, and lack of centralization.\nThe mix of approaches varies, and they are balanced against a geopolitical background of flux – as the old unipolar world of Western ascendancy crumbles, and the new multipolar world driven by the rise of smaller challengers and Eurasia (Russia, China and others) is being born. This is historical change, as has been experienced by humanity many times before (nothing is forever – despite what the MSM wants you to believe), and we are living through it right now.\nThe Great Game has returned, as was recently acknowledged by the U.S., and it is being played out in many areas – the media, energy, trade, culture AND crypto.\nThis is an arms race and a rush to secure and control a new industry in an age of blistering technological and socio-political and economic change, driven by undercurrents of fear, greed, ignorance and desire, so we should not be surprised by the level of incoherence expressed by regulators and governments. The world is not enough.\nThe fact that smaller and developing/rising countries are also now competing on a more-or-less level playing field for their slice of the ‘pie’ (Switzerland, Malta, Gibraltar for example) also complicates the situation. Things are changing VERY fast and the mainstream is having trouble keeping up; by the time they have a handle on things new projects and technologies appear that render steps taken obsolete– so we go round and round again on the great merry-go-round of regulatory swings. Approaches Taken: Hostility/Over-complexity The place of honour here surely has to be given to the U.S, for hostility, mixed messages, inconsistency and downright dumb decisions.\nIf you disagree then look at this list of absolute howlers (all of which have occurred): Tax reporting and collection on every transaction between alts and btc on exchanges and every cash-out to fiat. Using the Howey test from the 1930s to determine whether cryptocurrencies or tokens are securities, an approach which even Chris Giancarlo at the SEC admits is ‘not fit for purpose’ (his words). KYC/AML as a stick to beat ICOs with, which essentially performs a gating function preventing investment and has resulted in ICOs registering away from the US – a trend which is accelerating; this was noticeably absent in the West during the HSBC drug cartel money laundering scandal (and other banking/terror-funding fiat-based scandals of this kind) a while back. The deployment of things like ‘Chainanalysis’ against ICO pooling, a device normally used against darknet drug dealers etc. Corporate-owned mainstream media constantly bashing crypto, many of whom are partially owned by banking and Wall St. institutions (conflict of interest, anyone?). BTC has been declared dead so many times, if you don’t believe me check here: Bitcoin Obituaries Pressuring exchanges to give up their data without due process – Kraken/Coinbase are good examples of this – people are now moving away from US exchanges if they can (and this will increase). Retroactive legislation regarding sold ICOs and securities laws preventing and complicating public sales/distributions and delaying them; when all they have is a hammer, every problem they see looks like a nail. Blowing hot and cold on whether things are securities are not, producing massive FUD (ETH fake news here recently for example). Arresting people under 2018 laws for crypto taxation for transactions made in 2015 and 2016 etc. A focus on the development of private chain architecture offerings to introduce mediation and centralisation via the backdoor as a ‘safe’ and ‘controlled’ option (controlled by the Establishment, basically).\nI could keep going, but the point is made. The overwhelming impression is one of government departments such as the IRS, SEC, FBI and others all taking diverse and mainly negative approaches resulting in chaos, inconsistency and industry flight to friendlier jurisdictions.\nThe next one is even worse and is coming very soon. If you don’t believe me, then read this piece by Llew Claasen:\nThe foul smell of state cryptocurrency legislation\nAn extract from which expresses the essence of what is coming – possibly to be adopted by up to 45 states:\nThis, as the article quite clearly states, will drive crypto start-ups away from the U.S. – something which is already happening and will accelerate. This also creates precedent in terms of how not to regulate crypto .\nSome countries closely tied to the U.S will choose to follow this approach, or parts of it; others will choose not to in a bid to stake their claim to a piece of this new industry.\nUnlike in previous times the costs for adoption and gains are much lower and the playing field is a pretty even one, so it is a lot easier to do this, especially now that the U.S administration seems to be on a bit of a mission to alienate and pick fights with everyone, including its historical ‘allies’.\nThe EU is thinking of some of these elements for regulation for example but, in light of recent trade war rhetoric and events (e.g. the Iran deal cancellation), they are pulling away from the U.S. geopolitically and now may likely see a chance to snatch large pieces of the crypto industry away from the White House, so expect more friendly regulations coming soon – Malta is a case in point (hint: Binance – and many others soon).\nOther examples of government-induced idiocy include India’s positions in this area re exchanges and taxations, the fight between the central banker clique and the Kremlin in Russia (which the bankers will lose, I think), the ongoing intra-ministry spat in Korea between the ministries of Justice and Finance and a similar one in China.\nThis is a long list and is ongoing in many places, at many levels. Meanwhile start-ups and investors will vote with their feet and the technology will easily outpace political and bureaucratic inertia and infighting. Approaches Taken: Friendly/Reasoned:\nThree countries stand out here – namely Malta, Gibraltar and Switzerland ; others are also not far behind. Malta and Gibraltar are approaching this primarily at the ministerial level. By this I mean that they have put dedicated resource in place at that level and have wheeled out all the traditional resources to drive that and actually attract start-ups and existing businesses.\nThis includes the following: Temporary and permanent residence visa easing and facilitation Business registration facilitation Investment incentives and tax breaks Future plans to include educational investment to drive research and attract best-of-breed in that area (mainly Malta, Cyprus too – University of Limassol in particular) Additional avenues to drive this are also being funded also under the ministerial umbrella Future plans for friendly investment regulatory approaches for funding and building start-up value.\nSwitzerland has a huge head-start here, comparatively speaking: Visa structures are already in place historically and require only minor tweaks and so the legislative cycle is potentially WAY faster. Same goes for investment incentives, tax breaks and business registration – which are both already fully-integrated with their temporary residence visa architecture. World-class academic and educational infrastructure is already in place – only additional funding and direction/tweaks are required. Easy access to LARGE funding potential – hint: cash-rich Swiss banking institutions, VC funds etc. Ministerial resource is being put in place and Switzerland has a long track record of doing this in other areas, so the intellectual capital/experience and political structures to enact this are already in place and easily developed and utilized – look at what they did already with biotech and pharmaceuticals etc. Central location and incredibly high-quality infrastructure – education, highly-educated and skilled populace, schools and universities, air and road links, and excellent trade and investment linkages globally. STRONG privacy laws and protections and a supportive and more hands-off approach for regulation in development of new industry start-ups; this is already in place and doesn’t need to be built from the ground up. FINMA has already staked its claim by adopting an intelligent approach to funding and securities law as regards tokens and ICOs. They can move VERY fast compared to other countries and have way more experience and a more reasoned approach: FINMA publishes ICO guidelines . Stability and sovereignty – no wars since 1515 and no subservience to extra-national organisations like the EU. This means there is zero risk of external supra-national regulatory reversal from above and lots more consistency in the long term; stability is the key here – and this gives them a huge advantage against EU and other countries in the medium to long term . (A potential problem exists for Malta and Cyprus here, and also the status of Gibraltar is unclear long-term post-Brexit)\nMany countries are considering the elements involved here, and nations are truly in an arms race in this area.\nWhen you combine this with the speed at which blockchain and crypto are developing and the huge momentum building for mass adoption it makes for a heady cocktail.\nAs the ancient Chinese proverb and curse says, we are truly living in ‘ interesting times ’, but in a good way! Conclusion\nAs can be seen, things move rapidly, and it is very hard to keep track of things and establish perspective when things are moving so rapidly in so many areas of technology and against a backdrop of a world in flux, undergoing tectonic changes in terms of global power relationships in all areas.\nThe fact that crypto and blockchain have arrived in the midst of such a realignment, that usually occurs over multiple generations historically, only adds to the excitement and the potential for change over time.\nGlobal geopolitics are in a state of flux, economies too. Convergence and development are also occurring in AI, robotics, IoT, biotech, media and culture, and the development of global data streams as the internet audience becomes more sophisticated and informed.\nMake no mistake – the banks, corporations, and governments need to join the party and get on board .\nJust bear in mind the following points: People and companies can, and will, vote with their wallets/feet and it is much easier now too. Crypto is a child of the internet – possibly one of its brightest and most disruptive – and the internet was designed at inception (ARPANET) to perceive and react to blockages and censorship as damage and route around it. The underlying infrastructure cannot be unplugged or reversed now – our global economy would END, there would be blood in the streets. The boat sailed in 2009 when Satoshi’s whitepaper was published; even if there was a worldwide ban the protocol could simply be reproduced and propagated over the ‘Net (see above). Given a choice between a door to empowerment and freedom and a door back to nice safe government control with ‘safe’ centralised blockchains people will, over time, choose the former and they cannot be stopped; all the have to do is go through it and get off the mediated fiat bus. Bans and blocking don’t work; read the history of the printing press and the torrenting/copyright battle (hint – whack-a-mole games always end in epic fails). Crypto and blockchain people are extremely tech-literate, and usually at least 3-5 steps ahead of governments and others who are historically hamstrung by bureaucratic and institutional inertia; we move faster . The only consistent quality of what is occurring is rapid and relentless change – get used to it.

Cryptocurrencies look bullish after bottoming out in recent weeks. The Confluence Detector shows clusters of technical levels according to their importance. BTC/USD $7,735, then $8,161 The price of Bitcoin faces a challenge at $ 7,735 which is the convergence of the Simple Moving Average 100'15m, the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one'day, the Simple Moving Average 100'4h, the Fibonacci 23.6 percent one'month, and the Pivot Point one'week Resistance 1.\nUpon a break of that line, the next significant line is $ 8,161 which is the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-month. Further up, it is worth noting $ 8,332 which is the confluence of the Simple Moving Average 200-4h and the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 3.\nOn the downside, BTC/USD has strong support at $ 7,479 which is the congestion of the Simple Moving Average 10-one-day, the SMA 200-1h, the SMA 50-4h, the Fibonacci 161.8 percent one-day, and the Fibonacci 23.6 percent one-week. It is closely followed by $ 7,394 which is the confluence of the Bolinger Band 1h-Lower, the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-week. $ 7,053 is the meeting point of the one-month and one-week lows.\nThis is how it looks:\nETH/USD: $615, then $648 The Ethereum Price has advanced nicely and faces a challenge at $ 615 , which is a congestion of the 1d-high, the Simple Moving Average 100-4h, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, the SM 5-1h, the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-day, the Bolinger Band 15m-Middle, and the SMA 100-1d.\nUpon a break higher, ETH/USD targets $ 638 which is the confluence of the Fibonacci 161.8 percent one-week, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 2, the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2, and the Simple Moving Average 50-1d. A higher target would be $ 676 which is the meeting point of the SMA 200-4h, and the Pivot Point one-day R3.\nOn the downside, $ 597 is the convergence of the Bolinger Band one-hour Middle, the Pivot Point one-day S1, and the one-week high. It is closely followed by $ 577 , which is the confluence of the SMA 10-one-day, the Pivot Point one-day S2, and the Fibonacci 23.6 percent one-month. Even lower, $ 560 is the confluence of the Pivot Point one-day Support 3, the Bolinger Band one-hour Lower, and the Fibonacci 61.8 percent one-week.\nXRP/USD The price of Ripple is moving up and the XRP/USD faces resistance at 0.6740 which is the confluence of the SMA 200-15, the 1h-high, the Bolinger Band 1h-Middle, and the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-day. This is a cap ahead of the 0.6925 target which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-month, the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper, and the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper. The next target is 0.7261 which is teh BB 1d-Upper and the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2.\nOn the downside, some support awaits at 0.6520 which is the Pivot Point one-day S1, the 4h high, and the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1. Further support awaits at 0.6370 which is the confluence of the SMA 100-1h and teh Fibonacci 23.6 percent one-month.\nThis is how it looks:\nThe Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\nThis tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.\nLearn more about Technical Confluence\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/ETHUSD", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators#howtouseit", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/XRPUSD", "https://www.benzinga.com/imce?app=nomatter%7Cimceload@imceInline.load#", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/top-3-price-predictions-bitcoin-targets-8-161-ethereum-648-ripple-06925-if-they-break-technical-resistance-confluence-detector-201806041126", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T20:13:08.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03b2052f91e3f2e117977c7308f4a750b41536be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLQFB6ZnZyZHth9iW5uFHZsaeDWWkL_BMICj40.A3udikF32IxQw9ManueKBcuGmW3115DeAp0C44-", "site_full": "altcointoday.com", "site": "altcointoday.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin Is ‘The Only Digital Gold’", "title_full": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin Is ‘The Only Digital Gold’", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.244, "main_image": "https://altcointoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018_02_27_41371_1519724074._large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03b2052f91e3f2e117977c7308f4a750b41536be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLQFB6ZnZyZHth9iW5uFHZsaeDWWkL_BMICj40.A3udikF32IxQw9ManueKBcuGmW3115DeAp0C44-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin Is ‘The Only Digital Gold’", "text": "June 4, 2018 Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin Is ‘The Only Digital Gold’ Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said that “only Bitcoin is pure digital gold” in an interview June 4, reaffirming his belief in the cryptocurrency despite having sold most of his holdings.\nSpeaking to CNBC at the ongoing Money20/20 conference in Amsterdam, the veteran developer said he “bought into” comments from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about Bitcoin becoming the “single currency” of both the internet and the world. Dorsey spoke at two events in March and May , where he predicted that Bitcoin would become the international currency of choice by 2028.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak explained.\nWozniak reiterated that he is “not an investor,” having originally purchased Bitcoin at $700 to experiment with its use as a means of payment. “I have one Bitcoin and two ether ,” he told CNBC. Nonetheless, for Wozniak, Bitcoin represents a separate class of crypto asset to all others:\n“Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that.

According to NewZoo market intelligence provider, during the first quarter of 2018, the Amazon-owned Twitch garnered 2 bln viewing hours, with Steamlabs making up 15 percent of Twitch streams . Steamlabs reported in April that they had made almost $35 mln in tips in the 2018 Q1. In order to enable crypto tips, a broadcaster will have to connect their account to crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase . The blog notes that while only Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will be available for tipping — as those are currently the only coin options on Coinbase — Streamlabs will be “looking into adding other coins in the future.”\nTwitch has been accepting Bitcoin payments since 2014, with a slight break before they switched to Coinbase in 2016.

Bitcoin Searches Take a Nosedive Figures from Google Trends don’t paint a pretty picture. Mid-December searches for Bitcoin were recorded at 100 out of a scale of 100. However, fast-forward six months later and Google Trends show that number at 10, a drop of 90 percent. From January, when results were pegged at 44, the decline in interest is over 75 percent. Notably, the results highlight that this time last year low figures for Bitcoin searches were recorded in June as well. According to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this drop in interest is not a good sign for crypto prices, reports CNBC . “We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” he added. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.” Since the beginning of the year the number one digital currency has dropped in value by over 55 percent, and is currently trading at over $7,500, according to CoinMarketCap. Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels. Others, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market. Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin’s value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy. The founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC’s ‘ Fast Money ‘ that ‘all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.’ Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a ‘ screaming buy ‘ when it was valued around $6,600. It’s not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent.

Developers of bitcoin core and other blockchains have expressed disquiet at the corporate takeover, with several stating their intent to migrate to an alternative platform at the earliest possible convenience.\nAlso read: Crypto Point-of-Sale Devices Begin Roll-Out in Indonesia Despite Ban Github Buyout Causes Controversy\nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Github is a good bit of business for both parties, but the news has not been well received by the community who rely on the popular code repository. Github has yet to turn a profit and has been without a CEO for the past nine months. Microsoft’s arrival eases Github’s financial worries and provides stability moving forwards. The technology giant is believed to be interested in Github as a means of gauging what programmers are creating and ascertaining what’s trending.\nFor bitcoin developers, raised in a community which prizes open source standards and freedom from corporate control, Microsoft’s involvement sticks in the craw. A number of developers have now led calls to abandon the platform and move to an alternative repository, with Gitlab appearing to be the biggest beneficiary so far. It’s released data showing a flurry of repositories migrating to its platform. The Beginning of the End for Github?\nBitcoin core developer Wladimir van der Laan is of the opinion that the BTC repository should move, asserting “I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of GH toward obsolescence”. While there is nothing to suggest, at this stage, that Microsoft is posed to start hiking fees and plundering data, its ownership of a community that prides itself on decentralization is hard for many to stomach.\nMore than 1,000 tweets have been sent with the #movingtogitlab hashtag, and the company has offered a 75% discount on its pricing plan to sweeten the deal and hasten the exodus from Github. Other developers have suggested Keybase , which provides private repositories that are encrypted, with the bitcoin blockchain used to anchor identities. It’s too early to tell whether Microsoft’s latest purchase will mark the demise of Github or usher in a new era, but early signs point to the former. Those intent on leaving the web’s largest code repository are doing so out of principle. Github, under its new owners, has become the antithesis of everything they stand for.\nDo you think cryptocurrency projects should move away from Github now it’s under Microsoft’s control?

But this doesn’t mean there isn’t good short-term set-ups waiting for the patient trader, such as the clean head-and-shoulders set-up in Ethereum not long ago. Ripple also at that time gave a good look.\nToday, we’ll take a look at the recent rallies in Ethereum and Bitcoin as they are starting to show signs of ending and leading to another down-move in the not-too-distant future.\nSee how positioning changes in cryptocurrencies and other markets can help as a tool to determine price direction on the IG Client Sentiment page. Ethereum rally brings familiar resistance into play\nEthereum spilled hard from the aforementioned head-and-shoulders pattern, but has since put in a sizable recovery. The rally, though, has a solid level of resistance in play, a familiar area from some time ago.\nCoupling the longer-term area on the daily, turning to the 4-hr there is price resistance in confluence with a trend-line running off the peak last month. ETH/USD is currently sneaking below a minor trend-line off the late-month low. Looking for a continuation lower as the week progresses.\nCheck out this guide to learn more about how to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. ETH/USD Daily Chart (Resistance) ETH/USD 4-hr Chart (Confluence of Resistance) Bitcoin rising wedge could end corrective rally soon\nOn the 4-hr, Bitcoin is posting a rising wedge within the context of a downtrend. This has BTC/USD positioned to make a move lower, but traders will want to see it roll down out of the pattern first, as there is still a chance it pops to the top-side.\nPotentially stopping downside momentum is a trend-line dating back to February, which may be apart of a maturing wedge in place since then. The pattern may want to further itself along towards the apex of the pattern, which, broadly speaking, would be a welcomed event as the pattern could down the line lead to a very strong move.\nFor now, leaning bearish and will continue to monitor. Keep an eye on the daily trend-line on weakness – a hold may give us the larger pattern at some point, while a break could lead down towards 6400.

Bitcoin is struggling to maintain its ground in the mid $7,000s, and has again fallen $200 below where it was trading during yesterday’s afternoon hours. This position had previous been held for roughly two days, and it was widely wondered whether bitcoin would be able to strike $8,000 once again.\nThat doesn’t appear to be the case as bitcoin has ultimately lost support, and is once again struggling to push itself beyond $7,600 . One source suggests the currency is likely to find support where it is (between $7,400 and $7,500), and that a respective bull run could push the currency to as high as $7,900. However, if the bears have their way, bitcoin could again fall back to an even $7,000 in the coming weeks.\nStrangely, however, bitcoin is now getting support from an unlikely candidate: computer mogul Steve Wozniak. While the Apple co-founder has been vocally positive towards Ethereum in the past, Wozniak has been relatively silent on bitcoin. That all changed when in an interview with CNBC , he expressed his hope that bitcoin would become a single, global currency within the next ten years.\nComparing it to the internet bubble of the mid-1990s, Wozniak says he is confident the price and value of bitcoin could surge again. He also referenced Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey , and his previous statement that bitcoin could do just as Wozniak now claims – become the single currency for all countries in the next ten years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” Wozniak explains. “Not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way. Bitcoin, because it’s regulated in its quantity, you get down to supply and demand, and there’s more and more people who want it and demand it, and there was a hype going on for a period and it went up to $20,000, then down. I don’t know where it is because I never track it.”\nIt is interesting to hear Wozniak’s words for several reasons, the main one being that he doesn’t seem to follow the news or trends surrounding bitcoin. It’s clear, by his own statements, that Wozniak isn’t even particularly interested in bitcoin, nor is he really convinced by the power or dominance it holds. He just sees how much it’s brought people in the past, and he’s hoping for that unification once again.\n“If the demand increases and it becomes more and more popular for more things, and people start using it, there is no extra supply. It’s limited,” he continued. “In terms of dollars, bitcoin will go up over time, but it won’t happen fast. It may be sloppy at first, and things that change so much in life take a very long time to change. They tend to go slowly. Blockchain in all forms, however, is so popular and being studied by so many people and in demand by so many companies to examine changing their businesses in the future, that it may be long term.” About The Author ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "merkle pin shares", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T22:16:27.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6e250aeb6ba8953463f21217eb259ab1bf7d6c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVQ.MVJJFAQ0.R772SpFnLm9Jn86Coh8N0fkOL6bh9KgNXLqXW.QUMKVfVNqYHgDYwIux_omGaUC2cX55KOLB7sqUMOyFsIoqa", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "New Cashpay Wallet Allows Purchases With Any Online Retailer Using BCH - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "New Cashpay Wallet Allows Purchases With Any Online Retailer Using BCH - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tosh.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6e250aeb6ba8953463f21217eb259ab1bf7d6c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVQ.MVJJFAQ0.R772SpFnLm9Jn86Coh8N0fkOL6bh9KgNXLqXW.QUMKVfVNqYHgDYwIux_omGaUC2cX55KOLB7sqUMOyFsIoqa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Cashpay Wallet Allows Purchases With Any Online Retailer Using BCH - Bitcoin News", "text": "599 New Cashpay Wallet Allows Purchases With Any Online Retailer Using BCH\nOn Saturday, June 2 a new cryptocurrency wallet focused exclusively on bitcoin cash launched called Cashpay.

Bitcoin has been fluctuating around $7,500 at the beginning of June, down more than 60% from its all-time high at above $19,500.\nMorehead told CNBC’s Fast Money: “All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now.” “It's much cheaper to buy now and participate i the rally as it goes,” he said.\nBitcoin seems to be moving through another correction amid regulatory concerns, which might represent a discount price for cryptocurrency investors.\n“Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor and selling the fact,” Morehead said, referring to rumors about potential regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n“Get invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we're hearing about come onlin they'll already have their positions,” he added.\nAccording to Morehead, investors could buy a cryptocurrency once it breaks its 230-day moving average, which is a technical indicator, and hold it for one year. This might generate an average 239% return, he says.\nPantera Capital was founded in 2013 and has since then invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain-oriented firms. In mid-April, the hedge fund announced that its primary fund had lost about half of its value in March, after a steep downtrend in Bitcoin’s price.\nOn Tuesday, Bitcoin fell to the lowest level since April 12. However, it left that bottom after strong fears over a political and bond crisis in Italy. Last weekend, two anti-establishment parties, Five Star Movement (M5S) and “Lega,” had a failed attempt to create a new government, which could lead to an early election.\nInvestors were concerned that the early voting could mean a referendum on the country’s membership in the EU and eurozone.\nThe news put pressure on euro, with EUR/USD falling to the lowest level since November 2017.

Prices are bottoming up and that might be correct. We don’t want to tag along and buy with the crowd and that’s why we need to see our buy triggers at $7,800 if not $8,000 being hit in the coming days. That’s not all, for us to be confident that Bitcoin buyers would add to the five percent it has in the last week, then volume spikes must accompany that up-thrust. From The News\nIt is true that banks are really finding it hard to adjust to new competition. But, the thing is, what powers their nemesis, cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is not going anywhere anytime. It is changing how things are being done. Unfortunately, playing along is but inevitable. So, over the weekend Bittrex through their CEO Bill Shihara did announce that they now have a new partnership with New York’s signature. Bittrex、米ニューヨーク Signature Bankと提携へ https://t.co/W546yySpdX @YouTube より\n— へんなゆうちゅうばぁCHOPE (@YouTuberCHOPE) June 3, 2018\nIn their agreement, customers in some US states would directly purchase cryptocurrencies using their US Accounts. Of course, this applies to customers who have an account with signature and comply with the always tight KYC and AML rules which stifle innovation and creativity. If this goes through, Bill Shihara said, then a better environment would exist which would foster business for banks and crypto exchanges who are already working hard to sync with regulatory stipulations.\nWhile this is happening in the US, Japanese corporations are taking crypto to a new level. While laying their new strategy, Abic Corporation said they shall, beginning June 1-On Friday last week-offer Bitcoin secured loans. This is a smart move because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency capital gains are subject to tax which is “sometimes high as 55 percent”.\n— Kevin Helms (@kevinhelms01) June 3, 2018\nWith this initiative, Bitcoin holders can access JPY loans without necessarily liquidating their coins and as you can see, this is overwhelmingly beneficial for BTC users. Bitcoin is the only collateral and borrowers can get up-to $9.13 million or 1 billion Japanese Yen enjoying up-to 15 percent in annual interest rates. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIf we draw a trend line to gauge the direction of price action then we can see that bears are in charge in this time frame. That’s when we consider the last five months price action. In the last quarter though, prices have been “all over the place” if we may say but the last two months events are changing our view on trend direction. Bitcoin prices are bottoming out and we can compare April and May candlestick where the former was extremely bullish with prices testing $10,000 before that correction in May.\nOur metrics indicate that last month was a long covering event with lower lows recovering more than 70 percent of April gains simply because participation was low. The average weekly volumes in April were about 170K while in April it’s above 200K. After last week’s bullish candlestick and rejection of lower prices albeit high volumes is an indication of bear pressure exhaustion and a possible shift of momentum. Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nFor buyers to be truly in charge what I need to see is a surge past $7,800 and $8,000. It’s that simple and clear and that’s why despite these streams of bullish candlesticks, nothing is conclusive until we see Bitcoin supporters pulling our buy triggers at $7,800.\nConsidering how price action is shaping out in the daily chart, we might see that happening today and for that to happen, we must see a spike in participation as that minor resistance is hit. Afterwards, we might be free to buy on pullbacks on lower time frames and aim first at $10,000.

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Coinbase Opens Office in Japan\nCoinbase announced on Monday, June 4, its plan to enter the Japanese market. Vice President and General Manager Dan Romero wrote:\nAs part of our effort to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency, today we’re announcing the launch of Coinbase’s office in Japan…we plan to take a deliberate approach to our rollout in Japan, which means working hand-in-hand with the Japanese FSA [Financial Services Agency] to ensure compliance with local laws at every stage.\nCurrently operating in 32 countries, Coinbase claims to have more than 20 million customers. “We support USD, EUR, GBP, CAD and BTC currencies for trading,” its website states. Other than Japan, the only other Asian country the company currently has a presence in is Singapore.\nRomero emphasized, “As a regulated, compliant crypto company in the U.S., we will focus on building that same level trust with new customers in Japan.” CEO Appointed in Japan Nao Kitazawa.\nThe San Francisco-based crypto company has also appointed Nao Kitazawa as the CEO of the new office. He previously worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Japan and has spent several years as a member of an international law firm, litigating cases related to finance and real estate in Japan and New York.\nKitazawa is also the former COO of Money Design, a company that helped pioneer automated investment advice platforms in Japan. “As one of the industry’s top international leaders, Nao sits on the board of the Fintech Association of Japan,” Romero noted, adding that:\nOur new office will lay the foundation for Japan’s crypto investors to access a range of Coinbase’s products…Coinbase services available to Japanese customers will be provided with Japanese language translations for ease of use. Eying Japan Since 2016\nCoinbase has been contemplating an expansion into Japan since at least July 2016 when it partnered with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU), the largest bank in Japan and a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. “While we do not yet offer digital currency exchange services in Japan, we are committed to continue international expansion and look forward to working with BTMU to support this focus in key markets in Asia and globally,” Coinbase said at the time.\nSince the Payment Services Act went into effect in Japan last year, all crypto exchanges in the country are required to be licensed by the FSA.\nJapan already has a substantial number of exchanges competing in the crypto space. There are 16 fully licensed exchanges and 16 more have been allowed to operate while their applications are pending. In addition, the FSA has revealed that 100 more companies are seeking to enter the space including Yahoo! Japan and Line Corp.\nAmong existing exchanges, Bitflyer is the country’s largest crypto exchange by volume. Another popular exchange, Coincheck, was recently acquired by one of Japan’s largest online brokerage firms, Monex Group. Two other conglomerates are also operating crypto exchanges: DMM and GMO Internet. In addition, one of the largest financial services companies, SBI Group, partially launched its crypto exchange on Monday.\nWhat do you think of Coinbase expanding into Japan?

According to Steve Wozniak, of the 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, only Bitcoin can be considered ‘pure.’ Wozniak Hopes for Bitcoin to Become a Single Global Currency\nIn an interview with CNBC on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin will come true. The Apple co-founder made the following comments at the Money 2020 conference being held this week in Amsterdam:\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.”\nWozniak was referring to Dorsey’s comments back in March of this year. The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square stated that he felt that a single currency would emerge for the internet and the world. He went on to state that this currency would be Bitcoin.\nAccording to the article in CNBC today, Wozniak had bought Bitcoin when each was around $700. He’d since sold all but one. However, even someone as technically capable as the co-founder of Apple was a still able to fall victim to a scam. He was defrauded out of a quantity of the digital currency when exchanging them back to dollars. In addition to his single Bitcoin, he also holds two Ether coins – the native currency on the Ethereum network.\nIn the interview today, Wozniak sang the praises of Bitcoin more astutely than many commentators are capable of. He spoke fondly of its qualities of decentralisation and limited supply, likening it to a natural phenomenon that doesn’t require human intervention to work:\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nFinally, Wozniak addressed the altcoin space . He claimed none could ultimately compete with Bitcoin since each must serve the company that created it. Again, the topic of decentralisation was raised in his assessment:\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

If anything sets them apart, it is the vociferousness of their arguments.\nOn the one hand are those in favor of it, who swear that it will do nothing short of lay waste to the system of personal finance as we know it and build a Utopia for individuals and their monetary control in the future.\nOn the other side of the coin are those who believe that it is some sort of insidious front for criminals or a marketing scheme designed to bilk people out of their hard-earned money. The answer lies somewhere in between, though it’s hard to discern any of that from all the noise and the hype.\nIf you are someone who owns and operates a small business, how can you possibly tell what to believe? It takes a cool head to prevail when you’re surrounded by all this information, much of which is nothing more than spin by those trying to lead you in one direction or the other.\nIf you can clear the cobwebs out and find the truth, you might be able to see the ways that Bitcoin can legitimately help your business. You might also decide to invest yourself, which could mean on your own or by enlisting a trading program similar to Bitcoin Trader . In either case, it’s important for you to get down to the nitty-gritty of Bitcoin, which means looking at these simple truths. Bitcoin Can Help You Make and Receive Easy Payments\nIf you are a small business owner, this is a nice boon for you to have. Imagine the possibility of conducting a transaction with someone from across the world, knowing that the money that they intend to pay you will be in your account, no questions asked with no charge-backs, in a fraction of the time it would take to receive the same payment by credit card. That kind of convenience alone is worth something. Bitcoin Probably Won’t Make Your Small Business Thrive All on Its Own\nMany people are under the assumption, having read about Bitcoin millionaires on the internet, that they will receive a small payment in Bitcoin and wake up the next morning with their business coffers overflowing. Early adopters of Bitcoin made a lot of money. But the value has risen to a level that the gains in value are much more incremental these days, even as it is still one of the most volatile assets you can have. Bitcoin Isn’t Going Anywhere\nThose who are anti-Bitcoin will have you believe that regulatory bodies will eventually crack down on it and make it obsolete. There is a good chance that lawmakers and governments will come to a reckoning with Bitcoin. But that won’t necessarily be a bad thing. It will instead legitimize it and perhaps bring the fluctuating value somewhat under control.\nThe three factors can be expected from Bitcoin . Stick with them as your guide when making the decision and ignore the hype.

Price is at a crucial area of interest, though, and a bounce or break could determine the next long-term direction. If these support levels hold, bitcoin could bounce back to the swing high and resume the reversal.\nBitcoin price is pulling back to an area of interest after breaking above a longer-term descending trend line.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has fallen below the longer-term 200 SMA as an early indicator that bearish momentum is kicking in.\nRSI is indicating oversold conditions, though, so a bounce may be in order. Stochastic has already climbed out of the oversold area to show that buyers are ready to return. A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered. Not even remarks from Steve Wozniak on how bitcoin is the only digital gold were able to help. He cited:\nAll the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.\nStill, the dollar managed to recoup its losses in the latest US session, likely on the bounce in equities. Trump and Kim Jong-Un are still a go with their meeting on June 12 and this is giving dollar bulls optimism at the moment.

Most coins traded in the green and investors are upbeat it could be the beginning of a great run in the coming weeks or so.\nAlthough Monday sees many other coins trending in the green, none in the top 10 is near the performance being shown by Bitcoin Cash in the last 24 hours. The crypto has beaten the likes of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).\nAt the moment, Bitcoin Cash is doing double figures over 7 days, nearly 20% higher. It’s also at +3.72% at the time of writing, over the last 24 hours. At the moment, it’s trading at $1146, with a total of $952 million worth of BCH traded in the last 24 hours. It also has a market capitalization of $19.6 billion. If it sustains the nice uptrend, it could close in on Ripple (XRP) in 3rd place which has a market cap of $26 billion.\nBCH has beats BTC which has only gained 4% over 7 days and ETH 10% in the same period.\nThough not as high as the higher high of $1197 reached on June 3, 2018, it’s likely that $1200 will be surpassed within the day. And if it happens, $1500 could be achievable.\nWhat’s behind this good performance by BCH? And will it continue rising, both in the short-term and long-term?\nBitcoin Cash in Japanese stores\nThe revelation that BCH will be hitting thousands of Japanese retail stores has come at the right time for the coin. It’s part of the great news that deflects concern over the impending actions of Google. In an interview, Roger Ver, a staunch promoter of the coin suggests that there’s an agreement in place to have the coin used in vast numbers of convenience stores around the country. He says:\n“I didn’t post it or talk about it publically yet but we just had a meeting over this week; Bitcoin Cash is coming to tens of thousands of convenient stores in Japan and you’ll be able to buy anything in the entire convenient store with Bitcoin Cash which means including like paying your electric bill.”\nThe significance of this is that it gives BCH that platform to gain more traction in its efforts to be used as the top payment crypto.\nVer didn’t stop at that. He went ahead to state that Bitcoin Cash was getting into partnership with Menufly and Bitbox. The former has operations in major cities in the US and will accept BCH. The latter will provide a suite of tools for developers who are keen on utilizing the network.\nBitcoinCashers.org brings everything BCH together\nThe race to adoption is also been advanced by the Bitcoin Cash Foundation. The team created BitCashers.org to fast-track the process of highlighting why the coin is best suited for use as a payment method.\nThe new website will seek to make BCH reach a global audience, in the process bringing thousands or possibly millions of users to the coin.\nBCF’s Paul Wasensteiner commented on the high expectation, saying:\n“We’re excited that BitcoinCashers.org will assist consumers and businesses to use Bitcoin Cash anytime, anywhere. Bitcoin Cash is digital money that offers better features than traditional fiat cash. Vendors in places like Venezuela and other high-inflation environments are starting to use BCH to make payments without having to go through a third party such as a bank, government or payment service.”\nThe site has also rolled out plans to have a bounty meant to reward the community for helping with the process of BCH adoption. Other than that, the team also plans to hold regular hackathons, all aimed at pulling new developers to the Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem. The BCF team posted this on their twitter account:\n“We’re currently in the process of organizing regular hackathons that will be run every few months. The aim is to bring more developers into the BCH ecosystem and help them create more amazing tools.”\nIt likely is a “foot on the gas” rally towards adoption and use of the coin. As the good run on the market continues, expect more from the team. Bitcoin Cash will most likely hit $1500 again if the current positive trend continues.

Princeton for example is creating a program to understand the policy impact of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\nRipple has also signaled that this is only the beginning, with the firm’s press release dubbing the $50 million funding to the 17 colleges the “first wave of university partners.”\nThe funding comes as universities have sought to keep up with the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrency themselves. Universities including Stanford have added cryptocurrency-related courses to their curriculum, while other universities such as the University of Oxford are offering programs focused on the industry.

and after bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.05% traded in its narrowest range of the year, phase one may be playing out.\nRead: If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist\nTrading View BTC/USD daily chart Furthermore, bitcoin is holding the support line above $7,000 and pushing against a closely-watched short-term indicator. “The 15-day moving average has been a good proxy for trends,” said Sluymer in an interview, adding that momentum indicators have moved from overbought in May, to oversold.\nSluymer expects bitcoin to make an upside attempt in the next few days to test the 15-day moving average, which “remains negative.” A moving average is a popular technical indicator to analyze price trends over a specific period of time.\nSluymer’s colleague, Tom Lee is one of the biggest bitcoin bulls and has a year-end target of $25,000 for the worlds biggest digital currency.\nWhile Sluymer may not be ready to call the bottom in bitcoin, he does see evidence that those betting against it should consider banking some profits. “We recommend tactical investors/traders begin reducing BTC short positions and begin phasing in long positions,” said Sluymer.\nRead: Opinion: Bitcoin isn’t the first revolutionary currency\nMore from MarketWatch Jobless claims drop 4,000 to 226,000 Damn the torpedoes — what could take the S&P 500 to 3,000 Home sellers now use spycams to gather intel on prospective buyers Aaron Hankin Aaron Hankin is a MarketWatch reporter in New York who covers cryptocurrency and financial markets.\nWe Want to Hear from You Join the conversation\nComment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "http://twitter.com/@ahhankin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T18:53:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a5fdc3dc12717d41456a502aabaa732dec2158e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.itUuyrNfOjjNE2KZsEAlY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a5fdc3dc12717d41456a502aabaa732dec2158e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.itUuyrNfOjjNE2KZsEAlY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nShare the link to CryptoTab with your friends and get extra earnings in BTC depending on their earnings.

If the upward movement of bitcoin fades and the dominant cryptocurrency is unable to bounce back quickly to the higher end of $7,700, a bleed out to the $6,000 region can be expected. Conditional Rally\nThe corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 sparked significant optimism, especially amongst short-term bulls that have predicted the price of bitcoin would rebound back to the $10,000 region within June. While the $10,000 June target is still in play, another correction in the upcoming days will likely occur, given that the corrective rally from $7,040 has stopped at $7,700 and BTC has declined to $7,600.\nA short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as it required the volume of BTC to spike and the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum at its weekly peak, in the $7,700 region.\nHowever, due to its low trading volume, BTC has failed to test a major short-term support level at $8,000 and fell to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000.\nWhile the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not demonstrating an oversold condition for BTC. A further drop in BTC would not lead the RSI to drop by large margins and thus, a short-term turn around back to the $7,700 mark if BTC falls to $7,500 is unlikely.\nThe daily candle on June 4 was supposed to be the big short-term break for BTC, rising above the one-month descending trendline from May 6 and effectively establishing a bottom at $7,040. But, the recent decline in the price of BTC will likely send BTC back to the lower end of $7,000 or in worst case scenario, to the $6,000 region. Short-Term Not Important\nDespite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market.\nThe expected decline in the price of BTC is a 5 to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst. But, as Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead stated, which oversees more than a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, hedge funds look at the 5 to 10-year trend of the market.\nIn the mid to long-term, Morehead stated that bitcoin is still a screaming buy, adding:\n“As digital tokens continue to multiply and gain wider use, the $400 billion crypto market could balloon to $4 trillion, and even $40 trillion is definitely possible. It’s the 10-year forecast.”\nIf BTC recovers gradually from the $6,000 to $7,000 region and establish major support levels with strong and volume in the upcoming months, the $20,000 to $50,000 BTC targets of large-scale investors can still be in play.\nOften, tokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up. If BTC enters the $7,500 region, it is likely that tokens will experience a substantial drop in value, once again.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T14:15:09.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f69990e3d1eb2d904843ecfe12ef7e558293f3f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQci4bpH2iKrB1kQ1hhu3hhxzuXb7C_0E.a_EaRxBZY9d2evTF78ObHsRIp_In9CACEXAljladziMGcVW7kqhXO1_ZKra7qWDlzN1Qf29xl6WkNjRgl9SXuGZFccXq.DLo-", "site_full": "www.justbitcoinnews.com", "site": "justbitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "HitBTC: Japan Users Banned ‘Temporarily’ As Solution Planned For Q3 2018 | Just Bitcoin News | JustBitcoinNews.com", "title_full": "HitBTC: Japan Users Banned ‘Temporarily’ As Solution Planned For Q3 2018 | Just Bitcoin News | JustBitcoinNews.com", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.justbitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8yMzU4M2QzYTc2ZDAzODFlOThjMWZhN2M3NDk5ZTkxZC5qcGc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f69990e3d1eb2d904843ecfe12ef7e558293f3f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQci4bpH2iKrB1kQ1hhu3hhxzuXb7C_0E.a_EaRxBZY9d2evTF78ObHsRIp_In9CACEXAljladziMGcVW7kqhXO1_ZKra7qWDlzN1Qf29xl6WkNjRgl9SXuGZFccXq.DLo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "HitBTC: Japan Users Banned ‘Temporarily’ As Solution Planned For Q3 2018 | Just Bitcoin News | JustBitcoinNews.com", "text": "Tweet\nHitBTC has promised to reinstate trading for Japanese users later this year as it works on launching a subsidiary. After banning Japanese residents from trading on its platform over “compliance” issues, cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC said it plans to reopen trading in Japan via a “registered entity,” Cointelegraph Japan reported June 4.\nIn a blog post , the world’s eighth-largest exchange by volume – according to Coinmarketcap data – outlined its plan of action after users received letters warning them that the exchange would freeze Japan-linked accounts over “compliance” issues.\n“The company has been in consultation with the regulator and decided to suspend its operations for Japanese residents to comply with current regulation,” the post reads.\n“The measure has been taken in response to recent regulatory changes by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), and will apply only to those living in the country.”\nWhile not stating which exact “changes” had led to the move, the exchange appears to have planned a shake-up of its Japanese availability for some time.\n“Previously this year, HitBTC team started working with a worldwide-recognized Japanese law firm, the cooperation aimed to get HitBTC through the local subsidiary setup and licensing procedure to resume its services for Japan residents,” the post continues, adding it was also in touch with unnamed “authorities and regulatory bodies from different regions worldwide” over the issue.\nJapan has sought to formalize its cryptocurrency exchange market in recent months following the $530 mln hack of Coincheck in January.\nFollowing various closures , remedial measures and a buyout of stricken Coincheck, other operators continue to eye the country as a potential success story.\nJapanese financial services giant SBI Group launched its first exchange this week, while the list of competitors includes Yahoo! and the largest US exchange Coinbase .\nHitBTC meanwhile plans to launch its subsidiary operations in Q3 this year.

Prices are bottoming up and that might be correct. We don’t want to tag along and buy with the crowd and that’s why we need to see our buy triggers at $7,800 if not $8,000 being hit in the coming days. That’s not all, for us to be confident that Bitcoin buyers would add to the five percent it has in the last week, then volume spikes must accompany that up-thrust. From The News It is true that banks are really finding it hard to adjust to new competition. But, the thing is, what powers their nemesis, cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is not going anywhere anytime. It is changing how things are being done. Unfortunately, playing along is but inevitable. So, over the weekend Bittrex through their CEO Bill Shihara did announce that they now have a new partnership with New York’s signature. Bittrex、米ニューヨーク Signature Bankと提携へ t.co/W546yySpdX @YouTube より — へんなゆうちゅうばぁCHOPE (@YouTuberCHOPE) June 3, 2018 In their agreement, customers in some US states would directly purchase cryptocurrencies using their US Accounts. Of course, this applies to customers who have an account with signature and comply with the always tight KYC and AML rules which stifle innovation and creativity. If this goes through, Bill Shihara said, then a better environment would exist which would foster business for banks and crypto exchanges who are already working hard to sync with regulatory stipulations. While this is happening in the US, Japanese corporations are taking crypto to a new level. While laying their new strategy, Abic Corporation said they shall, beginning June 1-On Friday last week-offer Bitcoin secured loans. This is a smart move because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency capital gains are subject to tax which is “sometimes high as 55 percent”. Japanese Corporation Begins Offering Loans Secured by #Cryptocurrency #btc #bitcoin #Abic t.co/WzISi7EYR4 — Kevin Helms (@kevinhelms01) June 3, 2018 With this initiative, Bitcoin holders can access JPY loans without necessarily liquidating their coins and as you can see, this is overwhelmingly beneficial for BTC users. Bitcoin is the only collateral and borrowers can get up-to $9.13 million or 1 billion Japanese Yen enjoying up-to 15 percent in annual interest rates. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View If we draw a trend line to gauge the direction of price action then we can see that bears are in charge in this time frame. That’s when we consider the last five months price action. In the last quarter though, prices have been “all over the place” if we may say but the last two months events are changing our view on trend direction. Bitcoin prices are bottoming out and we can compare April and May candlestick where the former was extremely bullish with prices testing $10,000 before that correction in May. Our metrics indicate that last month was a long covering event with lower lows recovering more than 70 percent of April gains simply because participation was low. The average weekly volumes in April were about 170K while in April it’s above 200K. After last week’s bullish candlestick and rejection of lower prices albeit high volumes is an indication of bear pressure exhaustion and a possible shift of momentum. Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View For buyers to be truly in charge what I need to see is a surge past $7,800 and $8,000. It’s that simple and clear and that’s why despite these streams of bullish candlesticks, nothing is conclusive until we see Bitcoin supporters pulling our buy triggers at $7,800. Considering how price action is shaping out in the daily chart, we might see that happening today and for that to happen, we must see a spike in participation as that minor resistance is hit. Afterwards, we might be free to buy on pullbacks on lower time frames and aim first at $10,000.\nFull details at www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/04/bitcoin-price-technical-analysis-june-4-2018/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill shihara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "network technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T04:02:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03ef9b26546029881fc222e18f9f6c09999cc35d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLf9hEDkHlSQmT93zAXd4RZ68L9W17YcVAIVaebIYqZcvLXLNWWwX20B6LAkmo7b8b2aLKU7RdFbl7o_1oPKiU3n_a8LYWpLRi", "site_full": "altcointoday.com", "site": "altcointoday.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "A Startup Uses Bitcoin to Reduce Friction of Doing Business in Africa", "title_full": "A Startup Uses Bitcoin to Reduce Friction of Doing Business in Africa", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.937, "main_image": "https://altcointoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_370461095.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03ef9b26546029881fc222e18f9f6c09999cc35d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJTU6paxggVx9b0ebcAdFLf9hEDkHlSQmT93zAXd4RZ68L9W17YcVAIVaebIYqZcvLXLNWWwX20B6LAkmo7b8b2aLKU7RdFbl7o_1oPKiU3n_a8LYWpLRi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Startup Uses Bitcoin to Reduce Friction of Doing Business in Africa", "text": "June 4, 2018 A Startup Uses Bitcoin to Reduce Friction of Doing Business in Africa\nBitcoin can make a positive impact on the financial industry. This is especially true when it comes to regions where financial hardship has become the new normal. Companies such as BitPesa try to disrupt the negative financial cycle in Africa by introducing Bitcoin-based solutions. Africa Needs Cryptocurrency\nFighting financial hardship in Africa is no easy feat. Money is difficult to come by and unemployment rates remain a big problem in most countries. As such, the continent is a big market when it comes to remittance transfers. Residents travel abroad to find work and send money back home. It has become a booming business for industry leaders such as MoneyGram and Western Union.\nEven so, these remittance providers still pose a problem. Consumers need to travel hours to pick up money and return home. Additionally, there are the relatively high fees associated with money transfers to and from Africa. The price to pay for convenience is quite steep. While remittance transfer fees have dropped over the years, there’s still a lot of room for improvements.\nThis is where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make an impact. Their borderless nature and no intermediary involvement make for a cheap and convenient solution. Companies such as BitPesa are making big inroads in this regard. Even for them, however, major challenges remain in place at all times. Despite some setbacks, the company is still changing the world one user at a time. The Success of BitPesa\nAs one would expect, BitPesa uses Bitcoin as a means of settlement between the different brokers. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin can remove friction and offer a higher degree of liquidity across African markets. By embracing the decentralized nature of this technology, BitPesa is showing how useful Bitcoin can be in the long run.\nThe volatility of Bitcoin makes it a less favorable currency. Even so, some African currencies show more volatility compared to cryptocurrencies. BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello recently explained how Bitcoin can be bought and sold quickly in a time of need. As such, its volatility creates far less of a problem than most people would assume.\nBitPesa wants to help local companies by using Bitcoin. Solving the friction associated with doing business in Africa will not be easy by any means. Even so, small businesses, consumers, and even multinational can benefit from services rendered by relying on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The two last factors also work towards the developing of digital economy, and especially, of virtual currency market. Virtual currencies have already taken 0,1% of the world’s global money transactions and this really means a lot.\nBitcoin Crown's Benefits\nBenefits to the Community\nBenefits to the Community include: Gamify your website and mobile community with special BTCC Coins, Improve user participation and contributions in forums and walls, Auto-awards and prepare state-based triggers, Recap your community with in-game items on the server or game.\nBenefits for Game Publishers / Creators\nBenefits for Game Publishers / Creators include: Create new tokens to represent virtual currency, game items, or privileges. , Create and manage virtual stuffs programmatically or through apps. , Create limited time or subscription based virtual goods. , Mint items that can not be exchanged or special edition items. , Set up a virtual goods store.

Since the standard lock time may impose some delays, we will get a modern, responsive experience using notifications about an un-targeted chain.\nTrusted platforms will send an instant notification to the user's smart wallet for each transaction request. When a transaction is accepted by the user and created on a block chain, the purse will call the trusted platform API with the transaction to be viewed. Then the game or website can be immediately updated with a placeholder object or a non-renewable version of the asset until sufficient evidence is obtained to allow full ownership of the item. In the case of currencies in the game, the user's balance will be immediately updated in the game, but any unconfirmed portions will be blocked from costs until the corresponding number of acknowledgments on the block chain is reached.\nSDK BTCC Coin will display confirmed and unconfirmed balances when transferring BTCC and user assets to make the implementation easy and understandable. After the renovation of Raiden and Casper in the Ethereum network, these protective measures will eventually become invisible.\nBTCC will test the Raiden network to receive lightning-fast asset verification rates as soon as releases of the developer and the minimally viable product (MVP) are completed at the end of this year.\nCoin Acceptance in Bitcoat Crown\nCoins for Community Owners\nSix months after the BTCC Coin Crowdsale and the deployment of the purse and the main functions of the BTCC, coins will be slowly released to approximately 30,000 trusted gaming communities at BTCC.\nThe number of coins received by each community will be calculated on the basis of their previous sales of the store's volume, the number of participants, visits to the audience and various indicators of the website's activity.\nBoundy Adoption The\nBounty program will be implemented for any game, server or community that will start using the BTCC coin with a proven history of monetizing game content.\nWe expect a huge demand for BTCC coins, as we transfer our opportunities for integrating BTCC CMS into communities.\nBTCC will work with game developers and popular game servers of 20,000 players or higher to distribute BTCC coins as part of packages, tournament prizes or subscription bonuses.\nToken Sale infomation:\nName: Bitcoin Crown (BTCC)\nTotal supply: 70,000,000 Token BTCC\nTotal allocation: 50,000,000 BTCC tokens\nHard Cap: $ 10,000,000 USD\nSoft Cap: $ 2,500,000 USD\nCurrency: ETH\nFor more information:\nWebsite : http://www.bitcoincrowncoin.com\nWhitepaper: http://www.bitcoincrowncoin.com/legal/white%20paper.pdf\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/BtcCrown\nTelegram : https://t.me/bitcoincrown\nBitcointalk : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3194641\nReddit : https://redd.it/86zr0r\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/BitCoinCrownofficial\nGitHub : https://github.com/Bitcoincrown\nYouTube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRmFW2y8jjp6pXn6kLSGPzQ\nAuthor: tinhkhuat\nBitcointalk Profile: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1885373", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BtcCrown", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1885373", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRmFW2y8jjp6pXn6kLSGPzQ", "https://t.me/bitcoincrown", "https://redd.it/86zr0r", "https://www.facebook.com/BitCoinCrownofficial", "http://www.bitcoincrowncoin.com/", "https://github.com/Bitcoincrown", "http://www.bitcoincrowncoin.com/legal/white%20paper.pdf", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3194641"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T11:02:51.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "101d9ff8aaba633b51b6749873a353507d5e315e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7Pqg2ElsNnFtjP6arBrjIE-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "101d9ff8aaba633b51b6749873a353507d5e315e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7Pqg2ElsNnFtjP6arBrjIE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nUse your personal link to invite more people and increase your chances of winning.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The two sides have yet to disclose any details of the company’s financials or its valuation following the round.\nThe founder of the wallet company, Ben He, told Bloomberg that IDG’s investment will be used to fund an expansion beyond its home market of China, where 70% of users still come from. The plans include opening a new office in Singapore and hiring more staff, after it already tripled to 30 people over the last ago. Further according to the report, Imtoken also plans to expand its services for institutional investors following the development of new security features. Itbit (Paxos) Raises $65 Million\nPaxos, the New York-based company behind institutional bitcoin exchange Itbit, has announced on Thursday it has raised $65 million from investors including venture capital firms RRE Ventures and Liberty City Ventures. In May 2015, the company obtained a trust company charter and opened the first regulated bitcoin exchange in the US. Itbit offers bitcoin traders access to both a global exchange and OTC trading desk.\nPaxos plans to use the new $65 million in funding to expand its operations. “We will use the capital to help grow the business which is broadly our settlement business on the Paxos side and the crypto asset exchange and custodian on the itBit side,” Chief Executive Charles Cascarilla said. $1 Billion Binance Fund\nBesides established VC funds, elements from within the crypto ecosystem are also choosing to support the development of other startups. Exchanges for example, who made an absolute killing in 2017, have gotten into the action. The most notable of these is Binance, which recently announced a $1 billion Community Influence Fund and another Binance Ecosystem Fund with 20 future partners.\nAnd yesterday we reported that, Huobi has joined forces with Chinese VC New Margin Capital and Korean online brokerage Kiwoom Securities to jointly launch a 100 billion won ($93 million) investment fund.\nWhat do these developments mean for crypto startup companies?

These significant fluctuations can be profited off of by trading or increasing one’s position in the underlying crypto. The upcoming week has major events for five cryptocurrencies: PRL, UKG, EOS, PKB, and BRD. The Market ConditionsIn December of 2017, Bitcoin was pushing the $20,000 mark with many experts predicting a run much higher. The bull market turned bear and BTC is currently priced at approximately $7,000 per coin. This sixty plus percent retraction has led altcoins to retract even further. Bitcoin’s dominance in the past three months has increased as the total market cap of all cryptos has decreased.

In the thread, CryptoRae explains the formula for calculating cross coin correlation or CCC “ by averaging the correlation for every coin pair in a set “.\nThe thread then explains that this shows how all the coins of concern have behaved over a period of time with one clean charted line. For instance below is the cross-correlation for 25 coins since January 2017. You calculate CCC by averaging the correlation for every coin pair in a set. The benefit of using CCC is that it provides a clean line that describes how markets have behaved in over time. Here's the cross-correlation for 25 mid-to-large cap coins (30D rolling, realized). pic.twitter.com/pxw0rJhbxB\n— CryptoRae (@cryptorae) June 3, 2018\nThis graph shows that cross coin correlation had hovered between 0 and .20 from the end of the bull market in December 2017 to the start of the market correction in early February and then skyrocketed to nearly 1.00 and has stayed in the area between high .60 and just over .80 throughout May. Though CryptoRae concludes that cross coin correlation is not a good market predictor it is a useful tool for understanding future market behavior.\nWho Benefits from CCC?\nIn CR’s opinion keeping a diversified portfolio in a tightly correlated market makes little sense as all coins are following the movement of the top few. Buying altcoins that simply follow the peaks and troughs of Bitcoin for instance only leaves the trader open to the risk of the altcoin without gaining the benefits of open market potential. As the Tweeter commented in the thread,\n” it’s important to be more concentrated in high conviction setups. When alts truly come back, it’ll be easy to make up for lost time.”\nWhat the poster doesn’t attempt to answer is the reason behind the increased correlation since February. The mention of emotion, of fear and exuberance, as driving factors in the volatility of the market, is well noted in the crypto world. FOMO sets in and a coin or the market spikes, FUD spreads and the opposite happens but can that explain a sudden .80 increase in coin correlation that sustains for four months?\nMost traders in the crypto world believe that the market is manipulated to some degree by exchanges and or holders of extremely large amounts of Bitcoin who can change trends with a few clicks of their mouse. For the moment the who and why behind the close correlation of coin movement remains unknown and HODL may remain the best trading advice until the graphs decouple.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T16:06:53.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4065a7404d6ae2ef1fb44c97bdf9222d3d9cb6fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvRnWm4wFJVQRaZ8dOIkp8Dq4owvNXLyWhmel6NIJhtmjEocIWuv.XpVQSzv.RAP7.FkShtSXZy4pm2Hp0Uavo4fAqt0c1OIPX8i484XydBJIETyutQ4sn4ZaQdgWSVkj_5SmJVf.Aip2r1y0amjRZZQ--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/news/forex-economy/cryptocurrencies/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Markets : News, Economy &amp; Forex, Cryptocurrencies - 4-traders.com", "title": "Bitcoin : appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director", "title_full": "Bitcoin : appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director | 4-Traders", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4065a7404d6ae2ef1fb44c97bdf9222d3d9cb6fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvRnWm4wFJVQRaZ8dOIkp8Dq4owvNXLyWhmel6NIJhtmjEocIWuv.XpVQSzv.RAP7.FkShtSXZy4pm2Hp0Uavo4fAqt0c1OIPX8i484XydBJIETyutQ4sn4ZaQdgWSVkj_5SmJVf.Aip2r1y0amjRZZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin : appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director", "text": "DGAP-News: Bitcoin Group SE / Key word(s): Change of Personnel\nBitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director\n04.06.2018 / 12:56\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\nBitcoin Group SE appoints Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director\n- Former member of the Management Board of ACON Actienbank starts with immediate effect\n- Responsibilities involve the development of Bitcoin.de into a crypto and token exchange\n- Bitcoin Group SE is thus driving forward the professionalization of its structures\nHerford, June 4, 2018 - At its meeting today, the Board of Directors of Bitcoin Group SE (ISIN DE000A1TNV91) appointed Mr. Marco Bodewein as additional Managing Director of the Company with immediate effect.\nDue to the dynamic growth of Bitcoin Group SE, supported by strong demand for cryptocurrencies, the Group will further professionalize its structures.

Pundi X is laying the groundwork for Indonesian merchants to accept cryptocurrencies immediately after the rules are changed.\nAlso Read: Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) POS Roll-Out Begins\nPundi X, a Jakarta-based cryptocurrency payments startup, has reportedly started the deployment of its POS devices in Indonesia. According to its road map, the company expects to reach a minimum deployment of 50,000 XPOS units in total by Q1, 2019. Its states the mission is to make using cryptocurrency as easy as buying bottled water. “As the Walmart and 7-Eleven of cryptocurrency, we want users to buy and use cryptocurrency anytime, anywhere.”\nIn January, Bank Indonesia issued a warning to the public that it determined that cryptocurrencies are not to be used as payments in the country. It “affirms that virtual currency, including bitcoin, is not recognized as a valid payment instrument, so it is prohibited to be used as a means of payment in Indonesia.” However, this has not deterred the company as its devices support other means and it can thus deploy them now and let merchants turn on crypto payments when allowed. “The functionality for dealing in cryptocurrency is not automatic, it has to be activated when it is legally permissible in any jurisdiction that the POS is being deployed by the retail store owners,” David Ben Kay, Pundi X’s chief legal counsel told the South China Morning Post . Electronic Money License\nPundi X has announced on May 25, 2018 that its fiat partner in Indonesia, E2Pay, has received an e-money license issued by the Indonesian Central Bank. Constantin Papadimitriou, co-founder and President of both ventures, commented at the time that “Pundi X will begin, in coming weeks, to ship our new XPOS device —  loaded with the ability to process bank debit transactions, QR & NFC based payments, and mainstream payment methods, such as Visa, Mastercard, Samsung Pay and Apple Pay, with our partners  —  to expectant customers in Indonesia, while always maintaining compliance with the local regulations. The scope for synergies between E2Pay and Pundi X is apparent, and we will have more to say about these in the near future.”\nFigures we published back in March show that cryptocurrencies remain very popular in Indonesia, despite the warnings of the country’s central bank. In fact, there is almost the same number of crypto traders as stock traders among the 261 million Indonesian citizens.\nShould all POS providers add cryptocurrency ability to their devices?

There is a key ascending channel formed with support at $1,170 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term before it makes another upside move towards $1,220.\nBitcoin cash price is trading nicely above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD remains in an uptrend and it could eye an upside break above $1,200 in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThe past few sessions were pretty bullish as bitcoin cash price started an upside ride from the $1,040 swing low against the US Dollar. The price surged higher and broke many hurdles on the way up, including $1,100. It even managed to clear the $1,180 resistance and spiked above the $1,200 level. A high was formed at $1,209 before the price started a downside correction.\nAn initial support is around the 23.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,075 low to $1,209 high. There is also a key ascending channel formed with support at $1,170 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair remains in an uptrend as long as the price $1,100 pivot level is intact. Below the channel support, the next support is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,075 low to $1,209 high at $1,142. However, any major correction from the current levels is less likely, especially below $1,140.\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a nice uptrend above $1,100.

Subsequently, the technology will be offered to the rest of the trade community as a ‘complementary tool’ alongside the current Maqta’s Port Community System, a move that will fast-track adoption.\nThe deployment joins a growing list of similar blockchain applications within the international trade industry including systems developed by Europe’s largest shipping port in Rotterdam , Australia’s Port of Brisbane , Korea’s shipping industry and the world’s largest shipping company, Maersk .\nPort of Abu Dhabi image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram .

Cryptocurrencies look bullish after bottoming out in recent weeks. The Confluence Detector shows clusters of technical levels according to their importance. BTC/USD $7,735, then $8,161\nThe price of Bitcoin faces a challenge at $ 7,735 which is the convergence of the Simple Moving Average 100’15m, the Fibonacci 38.2% one’day, the Simple Moving Average 100’4h, the Fibonacci 23.6% one’month, and the Pivot Point one’week Resistance 1.\nUpon a break of that line, the next significant line is $ 8,161 which is the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month. Further up, it is worth noting $ 8,332 which is the confluence of the Simple Moving Average 200-4h and the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 3.\nOn the downside, BTC/USD has strong support at $ 7,479 which is the congestion of the Simple Moving Average 10-one-day, the SMA 200-1h, the SMA 50-4h, the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day, and the Fibonacci 23.6% one-week. It is closely followed by $ 7,394 which is the confluence of the Bolinger Band 1h-Lower, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week. $ 7,053 is the meeting point of the one-month and one-week lows.\nThis is how it looks: ETH/USD: $615, then $648\nThe Ethereum Price has advanced nicely and faces a challenge at $ 615 , which is a congestion of the 1d-high, the Simple Moving Average 100-4h, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, the SM 5-1h, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the Bolinger Band 15m-Middle, and the SMA 100-1d.\nUpon a break higher, ETH/USD targets $ 638 which is the confluence of the Fibonacci 161.8% one-week, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 2, the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2, and the Simple Moving Average 50-1d. A higher target would be $ 676 which is the meeting point of the SMA 200-4h, and the Pivot Point one-day R3.\nOn the downside, $ 597 is the convergence of the Bolinger Band one-hour Middle, the Pivot Point one-day S1, and the one-week high. It is closely followed by $ 577 , which is the confluence of the SMA 10-one-day, the Pivot Point one-day S2, and the Fibonacci 23.6% one-month. Even lower, $ 560 is the confluence of the Pivot Point one-day Support 3, the Bolinger Band one-hour Lower, and the Fibonacci 61.8% one-week. XRP/USD\nThe price of Ripple is moving up and the XRP/USD faces resistance at 0.6740 which is the confluence of the SMA 200-15, the 1h-high, the Bolinger Band 1h-Middle, and the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day. This is a cap ahead of the 0.6925 target which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month, the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper, and the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper. The next target is 0.7261 which is teh BB 1d-Upper and the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2.\nOn the downside, some support awaits at 0.6520 which is the Pivot Point one-day S1, the 4h high, and the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1. Further support awaits at 0.6370 which is the confluence of the SMA 100-1h and teh Fibonacci 23.6% one-month.\nThis is how it looks:\nThe Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\nThis tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.

Adjusted for inflation , his literary masterpiece netted him a total of $754.91 in 2018.\nTo put this in a contemporary context, think about an international chart-topping single, say Taylor Swift’s Shake it Off. It’s hard to imagine Ms. Swift selling that track, rights and all, to a record label for a little over $750.\nThe Raven went viral, first in the US, then in Europe. It has become so deeply ingrained in the contemporary culture that we’re still reciting, remixing, and reimagining it in various media to this day.\nPoe’s exquisitely crafted poem may have won him recognition, but his writing failed to earn him superstar riches . Poe’s lifetime earnings for 20 years’ worth of poetry, prose, and non-fiction amounted to $6,200, or $195,018 adjusted for inflation.\nThat’s about $9,750 per year – probably the sum that Taylor Swift makes as she sings Shake it Off at one of her shows. That may be stretching the truth, but not by much.\nUnjust rewards – Nevermore!\nThe writer’s financial distress had a profound effect on Austrian producer and composer David Brandstaetter . “Poe’s work, especially The Raven and Annabel Lee, has always inspired me,” says David, “He not only wrote some of the most famous poems of all time, he also established the foundations of the detective story and science fiction!”\nDavid was shocked when he first learned about the pittance the writer received for The Raven. It got him thinking about the hurdles that many of today’s creatives must overcome in order to earn a living, such as copyright infringement and fair payment.\nExperience as a sound designer at Rockstar Games Vienna and as a producer at Sony DADC gave David a deep understanding of the wants and needs not only of content creators, but also of creative teams, project managers, and consumers. It became clear to him that the digital content industry needed a platform that facilitated the production and distribution processes.\nQravity’s Rainbow\nIn February 2016, David founded Qravity to help bring original content to market. Soon, a working version of the Qravity platform was ready for testing. “In July 2017, we had a unique collaboration and communication tool for creative teams,” says David, “Qravity also tracks tasks in such a way that creative members receive stakes in the content they help make. For example, a person who writes lyrics for a song gets a share, say five percent, of the song’s revenue. Every time someone buys that song, the lyricist gets five percent of that payment.”\nQravity needed a secure and transparent means of keeping this process equitable. There was also the matter of protecting copyright and preventing piracy. “I was speaking with my friend and business partner Sascha Dennstedt [Qravity’s Co-Founder and CFO] about Poe and how, in some ways, little has changed financially for artists,” says David, “He said that we should integrate blockchain into Qravity. Some research convinced me that this made perfect sense.”\nUsing smart contracts, Qravity provides creatives with immutable and transparent records of their stakes in the projects they help complete. They receive these records in the form of digital tokens called QPT. Based on the amount of QPT they hold, Qravity sends creators a share of revenue earned whenever the content they helped make is purchased. They receive these payments in the form of Qravity’s cryptocurrency, QCO.\nSo if our lyricist has a five percent stake in the song he penned, a 1 QCO song earns him 0.05 QCO, which he can then trade on crypto exchanges, or spend in the Qravity marketplace.\nDecentralization for Fair Payment\n“[The Raven] will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.”\n— Nathaniel Parker Willis, Editor, Evening Mirror\nThe creation of art that transcends cultures and achieves a sort of immortality is one of the greatest achievements to which one can aspire.

Source: Facebook/NEM\nThe beach town’s initiative to embrace cryptocurrency payments stems from local real estate agent Gordon Christian who began looking into accepting cryptocurrencies after a client, a local business owner, explored how to go about processing a bitcoin payment from a customer. Soon enough, Christian’s interest was piqued further when he learned that Brisbane International Airport, a five-hour drive from Agnes Water, had begun accepting cryptocurrencies at a number of retail storefronts.\nSelling the idea to local businesses wasn’t hard, he revealed. “We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses and they were straight on board … I guess they were international travellers themselves and had heard of these types of payments,” he told ABC News . “Initially we had a good 10 businesses that just said, ‘Fine — let’s go for it’.”\nLocal tourism operator Arty Cipak added :\n“If it’s going to take cryptocurrency to get tourists to town, then bring it on.”\nPresently, 31 local businesses including resorts, backpacking establishments, tour companies and eateries are now accepting cryptocurrency payments through a point-of-sale app developed by TravelbyBit, a Queensland-based crypto payments startup.\n“We’ve got merchants all over Australia but they’re very sporadic,” TravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh said. “[Agnes Water and] the Town of 1770 has the highest concentration.”\nWhile it’s early days, Australia’s first ‘digital currency town’ could soon lure a nice group of international tourists to Agnes Water rather than mainstream destinations, according to the crypto executive.\n“The town has made a very strategic move in trying to appeal to a niche market to take perhaps some of those tourists … to come out to their little part of the woods,” he said.\nYeoh added:\n“If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers. Travelling with one global currency like Bitcoin … makes sense.””\nAgnes Water beach image from Shutterstock.

The degree to which a cryptocurrency is free from control by any one entity has become a stick with which to beat projects that don’t measure up to bitcoin, which is all of them. Such arguments are fallacious though, because when you look closely, it becomes evident that all cryptocurrencies are centralized to some degree.\nAlso read: You Can Now 51% Attack a Coin for as Little as $500 Decentralization: Easy to Define, Hard to Achieve\nWhen the UK’s Visa network shut down on Thursday, it provoked snickers from bitcoiners. The BTC network has worked faithfully since its inception nine years ago, with neither governments nor regulators nor hardware failures capable of halting its progress. It is bitcoin’s censorship-resistance, achieved through its decentralized design, that has lent the digital asset so much of its value. True, most of the investment in cryptocurrency right now is speculative. But the reason why BTC is trading at close to $8,000, and BCH at $1,100, is because the ability to store digital wealth in a manner that can’t be seized is huge.\nWe know that bitcoin can’t be seized, hacked, or confiscated because attackers have been trying their utmost to do so since day one and have failed. We don’t have to like their intentions, but we can appreciate the fact that their efforts have contributed to bitcoin’s rise in value, with each failed attack adding to the faith invested in the inviolability of the network. Newer blockchains, in comparison, have yet to be battle-tested, which is reflected in the value of their native cryptocurrency. With two of the most hyped blockchains of all time, EOS and Tezos, launching this month, the decentralization debate has returned with a vengeance. All Cryptocurrencies Start Out Centralized\nJust as a newborn needs its mother to survive those precious early months, a blockchain needs its creator on hand in the beginning. Bitcoin was heavily centralized to begin with; with no one other than Satoshi around to oversee the mining, it was unavoidable. But as more users joined the network, bitcoin transitioned to a decentralized model, and within a year it was no longer Satoshi’s plaything – it was now the world’s. Every blockchain that’s came since has also started out heavily centralized, with its creators intending to remedy this “as soon as possible”. Unlike bitcoin, however, many of these chains have struggled to make much headway in that regard.\nNEO : Chinese blockchains are notorious for being over-centralized, with NEO a prime example. It was meant to have been decentralized months ago, but it remains under the control of the company, who have the power to reset the network in the event of the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance system failing to achieve consensus.\nIOTA : Technically a DAG rather than a conventional blockchain, IOTA is even more centralized than NEO. While it is likely that NEO will eventually reach a degree of decentralization, it is doubtful whether IOTA works in its current incarnation without a central coordinator to rest things every time there’s a glitch.\nCardano : Charles Hoskinson’s Cardano will use a Proof of Stake algorithm called Ouroboros, but it’s yet to be rolled out, and thus for the past 12 months or so the cryptocurrency has been heavily centralized. Once Ouroboros is implemented, Cardano will be more distributed than at present, but whether that constitutes “true” decentralization is a matter of debate. Like EOS, Cardano’s consensus mechanism will place control in the hands of a few whales whose coins and votes will dictate decisions.\nEOS : The decentralization, or lack thereof, that comes with EOS has been fiercely debated in a network that is less than one week old. 21 block validators – trusted entities such as Bitfinex – serve as delegates who control the network. EOS’ delegated Proof of Stake algorithm places a lot of control in the hands of a few. A two thirds majority is required to reach consensus. Decentralization Is More Than Just a Consensus Mechanism\nWhile debates about the merits of consensus mechanisms such as PoW, PoS, dPoS and dBFT, and their role in decentralizing a network rumble on, there are other centralization concerns to address. Almost 50% of all EOS tokens, for example, reside in just 10 addresses . Then there’s the issues of mining centralization, leadership cults, and the risk of low hashrate PoW blockchains being susceptible to 51% attacks. In other words, there’s no such thing as perfect decentralization.\nAll cryptocurrencies start life in the hands of a single entity. The measure of whether that coin deserves to be called a cryptocurrency lies in the swiftness and willingness of that entity to relinquish power. Time and successfully thwarted attacks are the true tests of a network’s mettle. Decentralization is a scale not a switch.\nDo you think decentralization is the most important characteristic of a blockchain?

A trusted system requires checks and balances to ensure that the trust we place in it remains secure, while a trustless system does not.\nA good example of a trusted system is modern fiat currency. The money we hold in our bank accounts and wallets is backed only by the promise of the government printing it. It’s up to the government to ensure that the currency stays stable and that goods and services can reliably be exchanged for it. The government is the intermediary guaranteeing the value of the currency and has to be trusted for any exchange to take place. Trust is no longer mandatory\nDLT removes the need for intermediaries by anchoring the trustability of the system on the algorithms that it is composed of. It is mathematically incapable of duplicity and requires no mediation. By providing a trustless system without intermediaries, DLT opens up possibilities for people to interact in ways that has never existed before. This behavioral change will initiate the end for many industries that have long dominated society and signal the beginning for new ones based on a decentralized future. IOTA is disrupting the DLT Space\nIOTA is a DLT built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. The team behind IOTA realized that in the IoT machine-economy of the future, millions of computers and sensors would need to interact and pay each other, often in micro and nano-payments. They also realized that blockchain networks wouldn’t be able to handle such transactions because of ever increasing transaction fees and scalability limits. Moreover, the energy-intensive mining and consensus mechanisms of traditional blockchains would not be a good fit with low cost IoT devices and intermittent networks.\nThis meant that if the Internet of Things and DLT were ever going to merge, a new kind of “blockchain” would need to be developed, which is exactly what the IOTA team created – the Tangle network. To be precise, the IOTA Tangle is not a blockchain. Instead it uses a data structure called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and in doing so, the Tangle doesn’t just maintain the original benefits of blockchain, it can improve on them exponentially. Solving the blockchain’s bottleneck\nThe core innovation behind using a DAG is its ability to conduct zero-fee transactions and therefore, the ability to conduct nano-payments. This is achieved by cutting out miners and miner fees, which the Tangle in particular does by making validation of transactions an intrinsic part of the ledger—making miners (people validating transactions) and stakers (people sending transactions) one and the same. Qubic: the missing puzzle\nIOTA presented a novel DLT implementation: a blockchainless approach built specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT) and the machine-to-machine (M2M) economy. IOTA has the potential to bring virtually unlimited scalability and fee-less nano-transactions to the world. However, important features such as smart contracts were missing.\nLast week, the IOTA Foundation has brought an end to months of speculation surrounding the Qubic project . Being touted as the most eagerly awaited development in the history of IOTA, the new project seeks to create a protocol that “specifies IOTA’s solution for oracle machines, smart contracts, outsourced computations, and more.”\nQubic introduces not only oracles and smart contracts, but quorum-based computations, a form of distributed computing. In short, Qubic makes the IOTA Tangle programmable and introduces a distributed computing environment where machines can establish trust, share data and pay each other for any resources using fee-less nano-transactions. Oracles Quorum consensus of an oracle assembly\nA DLT like the Tangle cannot access data outside its network. Oracles are third party services that find and verify real-world data and feed this data to a DLT to be used for computations (e.g. smart contracts…). Such data could be any data like weather temperature, successful payment, price fluctuations, etc.\nThe incentive for oracles to stay honest is a reward system maintained by the qubic owners. Note that Qubic does not naïvely “trust” the third-party oracles. It ensures a high degree of certainty about the correctness of the data in question via a quorum consensus. Smart Contracts\nA smart contract is a computer protocol designed to emulate, and improve upon, the performance of a real-world contract. Its function is to define conditions which when met, execute a contract by the computers in a given network. Smart contracts are considered an innovative way of enhancing operational efficiencies and cutting costs for businesses, merchants and artisans alike. A self-executing, trustless contract\nSmart contracts can automate many different kinds of processes and operations, such as payment and actions conditional on payment, giving rise to previously unimaginable levels of efficiency and precision. They are transforming how deals and transactions are executed and managed in business life-cycles. Some of the potential use cases for smart contracts include: Digital Identity and Financial Data Recording; Trade Finance, Derivatives and Securities; Mortgages and Land Title Recording; Supply Chain; Auto Insurance; Clinical Trials\nUsing IOTA as the backbone, Qubic’s smart contracts go beyond these kinds of traditional smart contracts. The combination of fee-free transactions together with general-purpose quorum-based computation opens the door to entirely new possibilities. For example, a smart contract could be used to aggregate temperature data from different oracles into an average temperature, which gets published to the Tangle periodically. The smart contract has now become an oracle in and of itself—that is, the contract itself has become a source of external data, available for an oracle machine to pick up and send back to some other qubic.\nThese types of smart contracts are also just iterations on the more general capacity for quorum-based computations. Qubic therefore also provides a standardized way to define, validate, and enforce the results of a smart contract to a high degree of certainty. Implications of the Qubic project\nQubic leverages the IOTA protocol for secure, decentralized communication between the various participants. Additionally, since IOTA has its own built-in payment system, IOTA tokens are used to provide an incentive system for qubic operators. Anyone can decide for themselves at what threshold a reward becomes interesting enough to participate.\nQubic offers a great incentive for people to run nodes: let others use spare computational power or storage capacity, thus providing a useful service, and get paid to do so. Q-nodes can give new life to old, abandoned PCs, and they can provide traditional cryptocurrency miners with a way of monetizing equipment by doing useful computations instead of solving meaningless (and wasteful) cryptographic puzzles. Leveraging otherwise-wasteful resources\nQubic is optimized for the IoT – low energy consumption and a small memory footprint – but that does not preclude large-scale computations, especially for computations that may be parallelized and distributed over a large number of processors. In the future, Qubic will leverage the world-wide available, unused computation capacity to solve all kinds of computational problems, all while helping to secure the Tangle: an IOTA-based world supercomputer. The Machine Economy The Machine Economy—Powered by IOTA\nWith Qubic, IOTA Tangle will overcome the limitations of blockchain, to offer a complete technology stack of financial management, distributed computing, distributed artificial intelligence and swarm intelligence, leveraging trustable and immutable data stored in the Tangle as well as gathered from the real world. Let’s imagine an economy where: everything will be smart, efficient, autonomous and connected, economically independent and most likely managed by a secure, decentralized technical backbone – IOTA.\nIn the near future, as a consequence, we can expect that a machine will be able to pay its assembly, its maintenance, its energy and also for its liability insurance by giving data, computing power, storage or physical services to other machines. For the first time in history a device will be in a position to earn and spend money on its own. Such is a Machine Economy made possible by Qubic.\n(For more information regarding Qubic, visit: https://qubic.iota.org/ )\nIOTA Donations would be much appreciated: OEZSSIQJ9IWGHNODFAOQXGYZRBBEQAYTRDFCNWAZSPZILWQO9VYOYSXMQEDGYIURFAWQIIEHZQABDTTAAXFTANN9HD\nHow IOTA’s Qubic is Enabling the Machine Economy was originally published in Hacker Noon on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\nHow IOTA’s Qubic is Enabling the Machine Economy was originally published on https://medium.com/@Zass27?source=rss-c5b78e27b6c8——2 .
