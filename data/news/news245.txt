Roger Ver has had a major impact on the digital currency industry, both for the various companies and projects with which he's been involved and also for his outspoken support of cryptocurrencies like BTC. He's even earned the nickname \"Bitcoin Jesus\" because of his evangelizing on behalf of the world's leading digital currency.\nWhile it's impossible to say for sure, it may be that bitcoin would not have grown to the level of popularity it has achieved today if not for Ver's efforts over the years. In the more recent past, however, Ver has been particularly vocal about bitcoin cash , the result of a hard fork with the original leading digital currency.\nWith any digital currency, branding is key. A cryptocurrency may have the strongest underlying network and technology, but without the proper presentation to the public, it could be destined for failure. Ver's experience in the cryptocurrency world has provided him with many examples of successful marketing in this way, and he recognizes that bitcoin cash has a lot to gain by linking itself with bitcoin in various ways. He has helped to promulgate the idea that bitcoin cash is related to (or, perhaps, even the true version of) the bitcoin core project. This not only lends legitimacy to bitcoin cash, but it also calls into question the predominant status of bitcoin at the same time . Use of Leverage\nIn his efforts to promote bitcoin cash , Ver has not shied away from making use of his prominent place within the digital currency community. The CEO of bitcoin.com revealed via YouTube how he brokers partnerships for the bitcoin cash forked currency. When fellow cryptocurrency personality Erik Voorhees made a public statement refusing to acknowledge bitcoin cash as the original bitcoin project, Ver took to YouTube to record himself discussing why he disagrees, according to CryptoGlobe. Ver has not been afraid to utilize the influence he has gained as a result of his outspoken nature‚Äîas well as the investments that he's made in digital currencies and related companies‚Äîto make a public stand in support of bitcoin cash. With his advocacy, bitcoin cash stands poised to continue growing at a massive rate.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

While you can directly sell and buy Bitcoin, you can also use Bitcoin trading exchanges to continue your trades in cryptocurrency. There are a lot of exchanges where trading Bitcoin is safe and secured and also the customers are facilitated with many extended services. Being a cryptocurrency investor or trader you can choose any of the exchanges for your comfort. It is however recommended to sneak peek into the reviews of some before opting out the one. Below is a brief review of top Bitcoin exchanges around the world.\nCoinBase: It is probably one of the most reputed and largest Bitcoin trading exchanges with dual facility trading directly and through the wallet. CoinBase was founded in the year 2012 as through venture finding of Y-Combinator and since then it has rapidly grown. It has many lucrative services like multiple options to deposit and withdraw cash, money transfers between two CoinBase are instantaneous, Wallet facilities with multiple signature options for more secure transfers, Bitcoin deposits are insured for any loss etc. CoinBase has the wide variety of payment partners of Europe and US, who seamlessly allow the transactions to be carried on through them. It has relatively low transactions fees and offers Bitcoin trade along with a large number of Altcoin trading as well.\nCEX.IO: One of the oldest and reputed exchanges which was started in 2013, London as Bitcoin Trading exchange and also as cloud mining facilitator. Later its mining power grew such enormously that it held nearly half of the network mining capacities; however, it has been now closed. \"CEX.IO\" allows customers to expand to the much larger amount of Bitcoin trades, and it has the facility to make available the Bitcoin at requested price instantly. However, for this exchange charges a bit high exchange amount, yet this is compensated for the security and facilities of allowing multi-currency transaction (Dollar, Euro, and Ruble) to buy Bitcoin.\nBitfinex: It is one of the most advanced trading exchanges and it particularly suited to the experienced crypto-currency traders. With high liquidity for the Ethereum as well as Bitcoin, this exchange has better options like leveraging, margin funding and multiple order trading. Apart from this Bitfinex offers the features of customizable GUI, many orders types, like limit, stop, trailing stop, market etc. This exchange also provides about 50 currency pairs that can be traded and with easy withdrawals for all. One of the largest exchanges in terms of volume traded Bitfinex offers pseudonymity for trades and only for some of the services it requires identifications. The only drawback with this exchange is that it does not support the buying of Bitcoin or any other altcoin through fiat transactions.\nBitstamp: It was founded in 2011 and is the oldest of exchanges who offer cryptocurrency and Bitcoin trades. The most respected because despite being oldest it has never been under security threat and tills recently. Bitstamp currently supports four currencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple and is available with the mobile app as well, apart from website to trade. It has lovely support for the European users or the traders having their account in Euro Banks. The security is advanced and of cold storage type, which means the coins are stored offline.So you can say it is wholly not possible for any hacker to infiltrate. Last of all its complex user interface suggests that it is not for the novice user but for professionals and it offers relative low transactions fees.\nKraken: It is one of the largest Bitcoin trading exchanges in terms of the liquidity, euro crypto trading volumes and trading figures of Canadian Dollars, USD and Yen. Kraken is most respected exchanges steered through the turmoil of cryptocurrency trades and has managed to keep the amounts of customer safe irrespective of the other exchanges being hacked at the same time. With 14+ cryptocurrency trading facilities, the user can deposit the fiat as well as cryptocurrency along with the similar capacity for withdrawals. However, it is not suited for beginners yet it has better security features and low transaction fees relative to CoinBase. Most important factor for Kraken is that it is trusted in the community and has been first to display the volumes and prices on Bloomberg Terminal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alock gupta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:06:02.066+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ff3c9db06a24ef94c49bbb61d931d4415cce469", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZU0IFTQg8hu7HGd6kD.Uxk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin by Christmas 2018?

Square Inc's decision to allow users of its mobile app to buy and sell bitcoin this year was a \"pretty contentious move within the company\" and remains a source of internal tension, the payment processor's CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday.\nSpeaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc, reiterated his support for the virtual coin, but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board.\n\"We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology,\" Dorsey said. \"There is still a lot of skepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.\"\nHe added that the \"healthy discussion\" around bitcoin extended \"all the way at the board level\", without elaborating on specifics.\nIn January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin.\nThe company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.\nProponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply.\nBut it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility, slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability.\nThe volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets. The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.

Todd Prince A packed crowd listens to a presentation about cryptocurrencies on Monday, May 14, 2018, during the Money Show at Bally's. Todd Prince Cody Willard had what any conference speaker dreams of: A packed, attentive crowd anxious for the presentation to start.\nFor the 45-year-old former hedge fund manager, it was a bad omen.\nWillard gave a presentation on cryptocurrencies ‚Äî the most profitable and volatile asset class of 2017 ‚Äî during the Money Show at Bally‚Äôs, which runs through Wednesday.\nThere were not enough seats to hold the 200 attendees, mainly graying seniors, in the room. As Willard prepared to start, two retirees in the fourth row discussed their investments in bitcoin and NEO, another cryptocurrency.\n‚ÄúI am very scared right now because this room is packed,‚Äù Willard told the audience within the first few minute of his speech.\nWhen Willard asked the audience if they were ‚Äúchasing cryptocurrencies‚Äù to become ‚Äúreally, really rich,‚Äù an older woman called out, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù\nWillard warned the crowd.\n‚ÄúThis is not the time to get rich. Wait for the crash. Everybody here is in a frenzy.‚Äù\n100-fold surge\nBitcoin surged as much as 20-fold in 2017 while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, jumped 100-fold. A $1,000 investment in Ethereum in January 2017 was worth about $100,000 by mid December.\nWillard told attendees that even the maitre d‚Äôhotel and waitstaff at Wynn Resorts Ltd. were talking about investing in cryptocurrencies when he visited the hotel during the CES conference in January.\nHe warned the audience that the crypto craze was reminiscent of the dot-com burst in the 2000s. The Nasdaq-100, an index of leading technology companies, lost 80 percent of its value between March 2000 and October 2002 as many internet companies went bankrupt.\nWillard said he predicts that nearly all cryptocurrencies will go to zero. He warned them from buying shares of companies exposed to cryptocurrencies, such as exchange traded funds or investment companies, as a way to minimize the asset class‚Äô risk.\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy any penny stocks related to blockchain. They are scams,‚Äù Willard said, highlighting Riot Blockchain as an example.\nBioptix, a NASDAQ-traded company making machinery for the biotech industry, changed its name to Riot Blockchain in October as it planned to switch its business focus to cryptocurrency investments.\nThat announcement caused the shares to surge about 10-fold from $4 to nearly $40 in under three months. The shares have since taken a nosedive back to $7.80.\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are digital assets based on blockchain technology. Startup companies seeking to employ blockchain technology to disrupt an industry, such as financial services, often issue coins in exchange for investment.\nThe process is known as an initial coin offering. The coins can trade on specialized exchanges, rising and falling in value like currencies.\nChaff from wheat\nThere are about 1,500 cryptocurrencies, said Rudi Von Abele, a senior analyst at Guild Investment Management, who took the floor at The Money Show before Willard.\nAbele also warned the crowd that cryptocurrencies were high risk and said most of the 1,500 coins in circulation wouldn‚Äôt survive.\nAbout a tenth of the audience raised their hands when Abele asked who had invested in cryptocurrencies.\n‚ÄúThere is a lot of chaff and very little wheat,‚Äô‚Äô he said of the currencies. ‚ÄúThis is highly reminiscent of the dot-com frenzy, but orders of magnitude worse.‚Äô‚Äô\nAbele said many of the companies selling coins aren‚Äôt offering an actual service.

Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company‚Äôs board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\n‚ÄúThis technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,‚Äù Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlockchain Week.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.‚Äù", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:16:25.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fb42fa48a4f0f7b61e78fe003bc6eba431173cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sgpNDs2TpulUoA7FhmJJ2V8_tuEckrQQdGNNMODYJSW.3BKkrGtIWp3qhZBYN5YGtg--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Jack Dorsey hopes Bitcoin becomes webs native currency", "title_full": "Jack Dorsey hopes Bitcoin becomes webs native currency", "published": "2018-05-16T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fb42fa48a4f0f7b61e78fe003bc6eba431173cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sgpNDs2TpulUoA7FhmJJ2V8_tuEckrQQdGNNMODYJSW.3BKkrGtIWp3qhZBYN5YGtg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T21:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jack Dorsey hopes Bitcoin becomes webs native currency", "text": "Jack Dorsey hopes Bitcoin becomes webs native currency\n/u/AmericanHead\nsubmitted by /u/AmericanHead\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:51:40.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a5b01c674815d74adcd99f76d5da0f39b05536f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcyUrccdRMRKQVuEN3JEirE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=217.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Collectibles", "title": "[FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 5.0 BITCOIN PLATED GOLDCOIN", "title_full": "[FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 5.0 BITCOIN PLATED GOLDCOIN", "published": "2018-05-16T21:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a5b01c674815d74adcd99f76d5da0f39b05536f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcyUrccdRMRKQVuEN3JEirE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "krogothmanhattan", "published": "2018-05-16T21:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "[FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 5.0 BITCOIN PLATED GOLDCOIN", "text": "Yes...I am still in a good mood so giving out a free Bitcoin coin.\nFirst come first served.

Jack Dorsey, CEO and co-founder of Twitter and founder and CEO of Square, speaks at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology conference in New York City, New York, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Segar\nSpeaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ), reiterated his support for the virtual coin, but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board.\n‚ÄúWe have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology,‚Äù Dorsey said. ‚ÄúThere is still a lot of skepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.‚Äù\nHe added that the ‚Äúhealthy discussion‚Äù around bitcoin extended ‚Äúall the way at the board level‚Äù, without elaborating on specifics.\nIn January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin.\nThe company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.\nProponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply.\nBut it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility, slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability.\nThe volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets. The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own ‚Äúnative currency.‚Äù He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. ‚ÄúI am a huge fan,‚Äù he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey‚Äôs bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n‚ÄúIf we were able to use it as a currency today (‚Ä¶) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,‚Äù he said.

Whilst it's natural to get caught up in the short-term market fluctuations, crypto-bulls like U.S. venture capital investor Tim Draper recently declared that \"Bitcoin is part of a major movement\" and is still \"the best place to put your money.\"\nWith this is mind, we used the CoinWatch Platform and news sentiment to delve into deeper into Bitcoin's long-term prospects.\nBitcoin Bounces Back One indicator for Bitcoin's long-term growth is Bitcoin's ability to bounce back from market influences. Whenever a catalytic event occurs, like the fallout from the UPbit raid in South Korea, it usually sends tremors through the crypto market. However, the good news for Bitcoin is that enthusiasts like Crypto Hedge Fund CEO, Joe DiPasquale, speculated that this is just a temporary reaction while the markets mature. He said the \"markets have overreacted in past\" and \"as the market matures, investors will grow a thicker skin.\"\nRead more of TheStreet's crypto coverage here. Meanwhile, Blockchain Intelligence Group analyst, Shone Antsey highlighted that Bitcoin fell less that the other coins after events like the South Korean investigation. Therefore, even though BTC constantly battles with competition from other digital currencies, it is still viewed by Antsey as \"the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect.\" He also noted that Bitcoin is an \"anchor\", and \"the one to watch.\"\nThe fact that other currencies are constantly rolling out fresh innovative developments and streamlined features, is also helping to driving the crypto market , and in turn driving Bitcoin's own development.\nIncreasing Investor Endorsement Bitcoin still has a resounding bullish news sentiment and new-found endorsements from respected investors. This is a strong indicator that BTC has a promising long-term growth potential.\nU.S. venture capital investor, Tim Draper recently declared in a media interview that despite these rocky fluctuations, Bitcoin is part of a \"revolution for a better currency that is more secure, decentralized, effective, more useful and global.\" Draper continued \"it's open to everyone and far better than the fiat currency.\"\nHe then cited how \"no one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain' and since crypto is not connected to the external market factors, \"you're not going to lose your fortune.\" News has also surfaced that other iconic billionaire investors, namely George Soros, Alan Howard and the Rothschild family are now investing in digital currencies, which is another bullish sign for Bitcoin's potential.\nValidation from Traditional Institutions Although some skeptical investor tycoons like Warren Buffett recently brandished Bitcoin as \"rat poison squared\", there have been gradual signs that Bitcoin and crypto are being validated by traditional financial institutions. In April, Nasdaq paved the way for established investors to reap the benefits from Bitcoin, by partnering with crypto-exchange Gemini. Major banking giants such as Barclays and Santander are now using blockchain technology for certain foreign exchanges and transactions. There are also rumored plans in the pipeline for other banking and blockchain partnerships.\nGoldman Sachs is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS .\nMeanwhile, financial heavyweights like Goldman Sachs ( GS ) who were initially skeptical have now created a crypto trading desk. Former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn said of cryptocurrencies: \"The world will have a global cryptocurrency at some point.\" Novogratz also predicts that the New York Stock Exchange will be active in crypto trading market within six months, which should be another long-term trigger for Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Breaks Into the World of Tech Bitcoin has been gaining ground and breaking into the world of tech this year, which highlights its growing relevance. Since tech buffs are usually more acclimatized to change than older financial institutions, it's not surprising that leading global technology giants like Microsoft ( MSFT ) are now using the Bitcoin platform for certain transactions. PayPal ( PYPL ) has also jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon and is accepting BTC as a payment method.\nMicrosoft is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS . While these new platforms provide more competition for Bitcoin, it also highlights the increasing relevance of crypto for the world of tech and finance. Competition also helps drive more development and long-term growth, so we'll have to see how this pans out for Bitcoin's future.\nTheStreet presents on May 22: \"How to Stomach Market Volatility.\" Hosted by Fisher Investments and TheStreet's Jim Cramer, the exclusive live webinar will give you the tools to successfully navigate market volatility and discuss why having a wealth manager is more critical than ever before.

BTC\\/USD has to move above $9,000 to accelerate gains in the near term. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nThere was a slow and steady rise in bitcoin price above the $8,500 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded higher and even broke the $8,600 resistance level to settle above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The upside move was positive, as the price traded close to the $8,900 resistance level. A high was formed at $8,899 before the price started a downside correction. \\n\nIt moved down and traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,305 low to $8,899 high. However, the price remains well supported on the downside above the $8,500 level. An immediate key support is at $8,600, which is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,305 low to $8,899 high. Furthermore, the 100 hourly SMA is positioned near $8,550 to prevent declines in the near term. Additionally, this week\\u2019s ascending channel with current support at $8,480 is intact on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is placed nicely above $8,500 and the 100 hourly SMA. Therefore, as long as the price is above $8,500, it could continue to move higher towards $9,000. A break above $9,000 will most likely confirm a solid bullish bias towards $10,000. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is currently moving lower towards the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $8,500 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,900 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Primed for Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:34:24.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0acc51a90ebb5c7b6ceee8ec575b2b3c7d071848", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPqbE0N.7K3JrFN7CbZfRTILRcoAJxKTy5vg1_PAaALuKfmLOnF0s4_X2DrlpgpFhOl6hQSI8tW9vUhObmRotFfgxzB4ALJy8QlyeQUMBuKVT.W3BTwWtvnUd6cybDyB3U-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin mining manufacturers have seen a lot of s", "title_full": "Bitcoin mining manufacturers have seen a lot of s", "published": "2018-05-16T21:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0acc51a90ebb5c7b6ceee8ec575b2b3c7d071848", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPqbE0N.7K3JrFN7CbZfRTILRcoAJxKTy5vg1_PAaALuKfmLOnF0s4_X2DrlpgpFhOl6hQSI8tW9vUhObmRotFfgxzB4ALJy8QlyeQUMBuKVT.W3BTwWtvnUd6cybDyB3U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JP Buntinx", "published": "2018-05-16T21:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin mining manufacturers have seen a lot of s", "text": "Bitcoin mining manufacturers have seen a lot of success over the past few years. Thanks to solid Bitcoin price increases, the demand for such hardware is accelerating. Two specific firms are both looking to get listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Both Canaan Creative and Zhejiang Ebang Communication hope these listings will push their individual valuation to $1bn respectively. \\n The Lesser Known Chinese Mining Manufacturers \\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin mining hardware, the name Bitmain is well-known. However, other big players have come to market in the past two years. While Canaan Creative and Zhejiang Ebang Communication may not be household names, they shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. Both companies have filed a listing application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. If successful, both companies aim to prop up their respective valuation to $1 billion later this year. \\n\nIt is worth noting Zhejiang Ebang Communication was previously listed on the China National Equities Exchange and Quotations. The firm was delisted in March of 2018. That decision is a direct result of seeking a Hong Kong listing in favor of being traded over-the-counter in China. It seems China is not a favorable market for these particular companies. Hong Kong is a bit more open-minded toward cryptocurrencies at this stage. \\n\nWhether or not this venture will play out for Ebang, remains to be seen. Its listing request has yet to be approved by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Chinese Bitcoin hardware manufacturers show an appetite for additional capital. They all want to keep growing and further solidify its position on the market. Competing with the likes of Bitmain will not be easy, but with enough funding, it may become a legitimate ‚Äúarms race‚Äù. \\n The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is Appealing \\n\nCanaan, the vendor of Avalon mining units, has netted a significant revenue throughout 2017. A net revenue of 1 billion yuan is rather significant for this company. It also shows the demand for the company‚Äôs dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware is on the rise. A listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will only increase the company‚Äôs exposure in this regard. \\n\nIt seems this particular company already has significant support. Local sources report how Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Suisse are all in favor of seeing Canaan valued at $1 billion when it goes live on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This further confirms major companies are paying close attention to the cryptocurrency industry as well. It is unclear if these companies plan to invest in Canaan if the listing gets approved. \\n\nThe big question is how the volatility of cryptocurrencies affects both companies‚Äô chances. More specifically, valuing a company at $1bn when the Bitcoin price has dropped significantly makes little sense. Even so, it is possible both companies will have their requests approved in the coming weeks. More exposure for Bitcoin-related firms will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. \\n\n \\n Image from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post Chinese Bitcoin Mining Hardware Manufacturers Seek Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hong kong stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zhejiang ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:34:16.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "780c4884d84bf9fb6694c21eb6ce53e239ad29c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUMaP8msZFbz.X9ii9lNHayeNBFxSWVMpwIz7V6IGcTbrIsD_sfx4u_nXuMNlyghBqddiiYA5t2I.gzSxyqMewt3", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "published": "2018-05-16T21:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "780c4884d84bf9fb6694c21eb6ce53e239ad29c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUMaP8msZFbz.X9ii9lNHayeNBFxSWVMpwIz7V6IGcTbrIsD_sfx4u_nXuMNlyghBqddiiYA5t2I.gzSxyqMewt3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-05-16T21:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price continues to slide and is cruising inside a descending channel on the 1-hour chart. \\n Price is approaching the bottom of this channel but it might not be strong enough to keep losses at bay. \\n Oscillators are hinting at a bounce but moving averages suggest a break. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price could be due for a test of the descending channel bottom, which might still give way if bears stay strong. \\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals \\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is still to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA is also in line with the channel resistance to add to its strength as a ceiling. \\n\nHowever, RSI is starting to pull up from the oversold level to signal a return in buying momentum. Similarly, stochastic is indicating oversold conditions so sellers might allow bulls to take over from here. If so, a bounce off the $8000 level could be in order, spurring a move to the $8400-8500 channel top. \\n\n= \\n BTC\\/USD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nInvestors seem to be holding out for more positive bitcoin updates before reestablishing their long positions, and it looks like the expected selling of Mt. Gox bitcoin is keeping bears in play. \\n\nRecall that the exchange has yet to liquidate most of its bitcoin holdings in order to pay off creditors, and this selling pressure could lead to more losses for bitcoin price from here. It doesn‚Äôt help that geopolitical risk and dollar demand are also in place. \\n\nThe dollar shrugged off weak April retail sales as investors focused on the pickup in underlying prices and the positive revision to March data. This has allowed US bond yields to tick higher on revived tightening prospects, lifting the dollar across the board in the process. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:34:20.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5304f93bd162ff2178f43e766302e0018e195738", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUMTAsuASJri_HS1xiBn_zbvOSYgdsrrYNGjvKfSYaIYHDqaDyo7Sk8IbGw3JzAM.le3l6hDVWDllr_.yuHuJA57", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price was not able t", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price was not able t", "published": "2018-05-16T21:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.04, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5304f93bd162ff2178f43e766302e0018e195738", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUMTAsuASJri_HS1xiBn_zbvOSYgdsrrYNGjvKfSYaIYHDqaDyo7Sk8IbGw3JzAM.le3l6hDVWDllr_.yuHuJA57", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-16T21:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price was not able t", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price was not able to move above $1,480-1,500 and declined sharply against the US Dollar. \\n There was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair even broke the last swing low and it could continue to decline towards the $1,200 level. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar.

I believe that pullbacks at this point should continue to be thought of as potential buying opportunities for those who are longer-term ‚Äúbuy-and-hold‚Äù investors. However, I think that in the short term is likely that the market is drop a bit. Not being able to break above the $9000 level of course is a negative sign, especially considering that the $10,000 level is even more resistive. I recognize the $8000 level underneath is support, followed by even more support at the $7000 level. The volatility in this market continues, but I think that part of the problem during the day on Tuesday was the massive strength that we had seen in the greenback.

Having said that, the Japanese yen got pummeled against the US dollar during the day, the benchmark for the Japanese yen, but even with a soft Japanese yen, bitcoin could rally. That tells me that we are running into some serious trouble again. I suspect short-term selling is to be found. \\n\\n\n\\n\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

When it launched, its developer community promised to realize a vision for digital cash that they felt Bitcoin itself had failed to deliver: a decentralized, high-volume payment system with low enough fees for anyone to use.\nIn the week from April 17th to April 24th, the price of Bitcoin Cash almost doubled from $762 USD to about $1460 USD. In that same period, Bitcoin's price increased only 15%, from ~$8100 USD to ~$9400 USD.\nBitcoin Cash advocates heralded this rally as BCH making good on its promise.\\u00a0 So, has Bitcoin Cash achieved what it hoped? Is it better than Bitcoin? Do we have enough data to even answer these questions?\nTo understand what these numbers say about how BCH has grown and how it hasn't, we need to compare BTC and BCH across three dimensions: \\n Block size. How have BCH and BTC found their own solutions to the problem of scaling? \\n \\n \\n Transaction volume. What can current transaction volumes teach us about whether and how people are adopting BCH vs BTC? \\n \\n \\n Mining. How does the shared community of BTC\\/BCH miners influence the relationship between BTC and BCH? \\n \\n Examining these dimensions makes it clear that Bitcoin Cash hasn't quite yet realized its lofty aspirations yet, though it has made important structural decisions that are setting it up to be very different from Bitcoin in the years to come. BCH's bigger blocks haven't mattered yet From today, Bitcoin Cash's block size will be 32 times as large as Bitcoin's (non-SegWit) 1-MB blocks, and it has always been the BCH position that block size matters.\\u00a0 From the hard fork onward, the drastic difference in size between BTC's 1-MB blocks and BCH's 8-MB blocks has been a key differentiator between these networks. BCH's bigger block sizes mean that it can currently support far more transactions than Bitcoin can in the same amount of time.\\u00a0 While transaction volume now on BCH isn't close to what it can support, the block size debate shows how differently both networks think about scaling.\nWhere Bitcoin Cash supporters like to identify bigger block size with cheaper, faster transactions, the Bitcoin camp views Layer-2 solutions like the\\u00a0 Lightning Network as a better method of scaling. Bitcoin Cash supporters believe that bigger block sizes will ultimately lead to a network that anyone can transact on\\u2014one that can serve as a \\u2018PayPal 2.0.\\u2019\nThe average transaction size for Bitcoin Cash is about 200 bytes, which means that each of the network's 10-minute, 8 MB blocks could support (on average) 40,000 transactions, for a total of 5,760,000 per day. In contrast, BTC's 1 MB (non-SegWit) blocks can each only support 5,000 transactions of the same size, for a total of 600,000 per day.\nBut even though BCH is built to handle huge numbers of transactions, it's only averaging around 20,000 per day in the last couple of weeks\\u2014just 0.34% of the daily volume it could support with its 8MB block.\nSo why double down on block size given that at only 8MB, BCH's transactions are nowhere near its block size limit? \\u00a0According to Bitcoin ABC , the developer team orchestrating the fork, this upgrade is designed to keep improving [BCH] as a form of money.\n\\u201cWe want to make it more reliable, more scalable, with low fees and ready for rapid growth. It should 'just work', without complications or hassles. It should be ready for global adoption by mainstream users, and provide a solid foundation that businesses can rely on.\\u201d\nBitcoin supporters, on the other hand, endorse Layer-2 scaling solutions over BCH's larger-blocks solution because they worry bigger isn't better when it comes to block size , as exceptionally large blocks could put mining beyond the reach of ordinary people's storage and bandwidth capacities.\nLarge blocks could have meant that only the largest, most organized mining pools would be able to mine new blocks\\u2014something which is antithetical to Bitcoin's core value of decentralization.\nA Layer-2 protocol like Lightning Network promises to solve this problem by enabling \\u201dmillions to billions of transactions per second\\u201d off of the base blockchain\\u2014though this network is still in its early stages.\nBut the difference in block-size approach between BTC and BCH is even now setting the stage for two kinds of blockchain that will be very different in the future: one that supports huge numbers of instant, low-fee transactions on its own (Bitcoin Cash), and another that is investing in an ecosystem of off-chain scaling solutions (Bitcoin). If you build it, they might come... Mempool size, all else being equal, is directly related to transaction fee size : a smaller pool of pending transactions means you don't have to pay as much to get your transaction confirmed by miners. It makes sense, therefore, that BCH's relatively small mempool size has led to very low transaction fees\\u2014 typically in the order of $0.004 USD. \\u00a0 Bitcoin, on the other hand, usually has a mempool of around 7,000 transactions these days\\u2014far more than BCH's. Bitcoin's transaction fees, correspondingly, are much higher than BCH's, with\\u00a0 a median transaction fee between $0.15 USD and $2 USD \\u00a0- and yet it has maintained a transaction volume that exceeds BCH's by an order of magnitude. Bitcoin Cash may eventually prove itself as the new, decentralized PayPal, but for now, it hasn't convinced the wider market that it's better suited for this task than Bitcoin is. That is not to say that there hasn't been any movement in that direction, however. Back at the time of the fork, BCH had a mere ~0.11 transactions per second to BTC's ~2.42 tps. Nine months later, BTC's transaction volume has remained remarkably constant\\u2014stable at 2.42 tps\\u2014while BCH's volume has doubled to ~0.22 tps. In this case, the growth in BCH transactions could be due to a growing interest in crypto-based commerce, or just be the result of more widespread speculation in the crypto space overall. Nonetheless, BCH's small transaction volume despite its mempool size (it usually doesn't have more than 500 pending transactions at any given time) and low transaction fees\\u2014shows the public just isn't flocking to it in the way the BCH community anticipated. All this notwithstanding, it does seem that the market has recognized some distinct value in BCH, given its market cap has increased almost 300% from the hard fork to now, compared to just over 200% for Bitcoin. The mining swings have settled down Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash use the same hashing algorithm: SHA-256. Because of this, many miners mine both the cryptocurrencies.\\u00a0 Especially in the first few months of BCH's existence, there was\\u00a0huge\\u00a0variation in the profitability of mining BTC vs the profitability of mining BCH. This led miners to oscillate back and forth between the two networks, which resulted in commensurate variation in BTC and BCH's\\u00a0hashrate.\\u00a0 Now, though, we're seeing that the profitability of mining BTC and the\\u00a0 profitablity \\u00a0of mining BCH are much closer to each other than they used to be, and the\\u00a0 hashrates \\u00a0have balanced out accordingly. In the past few months, we've seen both\\u00a0 hashrates \\u00a0gradually and consistently increasing\\u2014which is what you'd expect, given the continued adoption of and interest in cryptocurrencies more broadly. For both BTC and BCH, over half the new blocks are created by the same six pools: BTC.top, ViaBTC, AntPool, BTC.com, Bitcoin.com and F2Pool. However, in recent months, given the differential in profitability between mining BTC and mining BCH has decreased substantially, the switching back and forth between the two cryptocurrencies by mining pools has decreased considerably. The future: can Bitcoin Cash coexist with Bitcoin? Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have distinct long-term aims, and the differences in how they're already handling transaction volume and block size reflect those aims.\\u00a0\nEventually, BTC and BCH may be able to peacefully coexist with different goals, with BTC acting like gold and BCH acting like PayPal\\u2014but BCH will have to grow far more before that possibility has a chance of being realized.\nThe post Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin: How is BCH measuring up?

( MSFT ) announced this week that its Bing search engine will ban cryptocurrency advertisements on its platform.\nIn a company blog post , Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, advertiser policy manager at the Redmond, Washington-based software giant, said Microsoft is constantly evaluating its policies to ensure consumers and digital advertisers have a safe and engaging time searching on Bing. She said the company has determined that crypto ads present a ‚Äúpossible elevated risk‚Äù with the potential for ‚Äúbad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers.‚Äù As a result, the software giant said it will disallow advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency-related products and unregulated binary options . The policy will roll out in late June and early July, noted Alsoszatai-Petheo. Microsoft Late to the Crypto Ad Ban\nWhen it comes to search engines banning crypto ads, Microsoft is a bit late to the party. In March, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs ( GOOGL ) Google announced that starting in June it will stop allowing advertising related to digital tokens from all of its online platforms. That news sent the price of bitcoin down 7%. In a blog post at the time, it said it won‚Äôt allow ads for initial coin offerings , crypto exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency trading advice. Earlier in the year, Facebook Inc. ( FB ) announced similar plans and reports have surfaced that Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ) is doing the same. (See also: Google Bans Advertising Related to Cryptocurrency Products . )\nThe moves on the part of the technology firms come at a time when regulators around the world are looking at ways to stay on top of the cryptocurrency market, which has not only sent the price of Bitcoin surging but also spawned an entire digital token mining industry that has boded well for graphics chipmakers NVIDIA Corp. ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). Microsoft Focused on Blockchain Tech\nIt also comes as Microsoft is plowing ahead with its efforts in blockchain , the technology that underpins cryptocurrency, as are many other technology and financial services players. In February, Microsoft announced plans to create a new form of a digital identity on the internet. ‚ÄúRather than grant broad consent to countless apps and services, and have their identity data spread across numerous providers, individuals need a secure encrypted digital hub where they can store their identity data and easily control access to it,‚Äù wrote Ankur Patel, principal program manager at Microsoft‚Äôs Identity division in a blog post back then, adding that the ‚Äúself-owned identity‚Äù would be easy to use and provide users with ‚Äúcomplete control‚Äù over how and when it is used.

Published on May 10, 2018 Josh Sigurdson talks with Jeff Berwick of The Dollar Vigilante and Anarchast about the most talked about cryptocurrency of 2018 which is of course EOS. Since July 2017, we've seen EOS climb to $2.80, fall down to 50 cents and climb back up to $22! It has the most interesting expectations and speculations and at the end of the day, it's still just an ICO!EOS was created by our friend Dan Larimer who also created Bitshares and Steem as well as Steem's social media network, Steemit! Being a perfectionist, Dan Larimer is obsessed with bringing the best cryptocurrency to market. Well EOS has a lot promised, and those of us who believe in what Dan does know that it is more than just a promise. EOS is said to have smart media tokens when released on June 1st. Alongside this is password protection, a new social media site, complete self governing transparency, no fees, fast transactions and the list goes on. Many say it will knock Steemit out of the market which is not something we believe. It's more likely to just compete against another great creation. There's room for more than one in the market just like there is Burger King AND McDonalds. EOS will be released on June 1st and will likely make a minor dip before returning to new all-time-highs. It has the potential to climb far above 5th place in the crypto market as Ethereum unfortunately faces off against the SEC.Now, speaking of competition in the markets, Jeff also goes into Bitcoin Cash and the incredible rallies we've seen in the currency in recent weeks as we return to a bull market.

New York-based startup, goTenna Inc. is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an android application which allows users to send Bitcoin payments with an active internet connection. goTenna is a startup that designs and develops technology for decentralized communications. The devices from goTenna can be paired with smartphones, which enables the users to share information on a peer-to-peer basis even without any centralized communications infrastructure. On 14 th May, at the Consensus 2018 goTenna had announced a new application called the ‚ÄòtxTenna‚Äô, which would allow users to connect their smartphones with a goTenna device and use a cryptocurrency trading wallet to send payments. The developers of the application have said that as long a phone is charged, the user can communicate. The application has done wonders during the Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, by helping people reconnect. The concept is decades-old which enables people to use the internet without a Wifi network or an active LAN network. But the other goTenna device has to be within a mile of this device for sending the message across the mesh network. The cryptocurrency user should be within a mile of another active device, transactions bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an active internet connection. Samourai wallet had reached out to goTenna with the idea of its open source communication code. txTenna works as the same principle as the iOS wallet. txTenna is going to be an alternative which would be censorship-resistant and will be an open source project. The application could work with any software wallet, txTenna can send transactions without the use of the internet in almost any wallet provider. Peter James has tweeted that:\n‚ÄúSending Bitcoin without going through a mining rig?‚Äù Fulmo a lightning network startup has tweeted that:\n‚ÄúCan @goTenna help decentralize #Bitcoin transactions?

The price failed to move above the mentioned levels and declined sharply below $1,400. The decline was such that the price even broke the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,330 low to $1,495 high. \\n\nIt opened the doors for more losses and there was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair even settled below the $1,300 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. These are bearish signs below $1,300 and it seems like the price may continue to trade lower in the short term. It is currently trading near the $1,240 level with a lot of selling pressure.

In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA is also in line with the channel resistance to add to its strength as a ceiling. \\n\nHowever, RSI is starting to pull up from the oversold level to signal a return in buying momentum. Similarly, stochastic is indicating oversold conditions so sellers might allow bulls to take over from here. If so, a bounce off the $8000 level could be in order, spurring a move to the $8400-8500 channel top. \\n\n= \\n BTC\\/USD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nInvestors seem to be holding out for more positive bitcoin updates before reestablishing their long positions, and it looks like the expected selling of Mt. Gox bitcoin is keeping bears in play. \\n\nRecall that the exchange has yet to liquidate most of its bitcoin holdings in order to pay off creditors, and this selling pressure could lead to more losses for bitcoin price from here. It doesn‚Äôt help that geopolitical risk and dollar demand are also in place. \\n\nThe dollar shrugged off weak April retail sales as investors focused on the pickup in underlying prices and the positive revision to March data. This has allowed US bond yields to tick higher on revived tightening prospects, lifting the dollar across the board in the process. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Weak Support Zone Just Close By ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:20:21.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dfdae09765465fafe84e773cc5638178f810886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocEOB0ak.NfnM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-16T21:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dfdae09765465fafe84e773cc5638178f810886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfl1s5xJfocEOB0ak.NfnM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wasaisi", "published": "2018-05-16T21:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "How foolish are people who invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "An investment into BTC is sure to be profitable for all, no matter the level, do not look down on BTC, It is still the correction and bear season, sure the rise of Bitcoin will happen soon and all critics will bow there head.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T03:02:37.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8efc2a35fb704d5f846d60a65705a41f40fe9493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGq.McCyhzR3rJqkyGRYabTVzaLDi1X0Hia6IHIGZjozdk0mOlA1mlAG9aYJeNrkgFQ--", "site_full": "www.sciencenewsdaily.org", "site": "sciencenewsdaily.org", "site_section": "http://www.sciencenewsdaily.org/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Science News Daily", "title": "Bitcoin Will Soon Use More Energy Than Austria", "title_full": "Bitcoin Will Soon Use More Energy Than Austria", "published": "2018-05-16T21:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8efc2a35fb704d5f846d60a65705a41f40fe9493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGq.McCyhzR3rJqkyGRYabTVzaLDi1X0Hia6IHIGZjozdk0mOlA1mlAG9aYJeNrkgFQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T21:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Will Soon Use More Energy Than Austria", "text": "Other Bitcoin Will Soon Use More Energy Than Austria Bitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value.

But still if you really wanted it you can find some solutions but I am gonna say it is worth it in a longer run not in an instant", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:57:55.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2e89bae788956db5d5cda375b041eb362f8d72a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcPrx8SPE9I.oAhZuy7JUKup2aWxiQclfHamqwJ6WgQiKUJtf5guAWSwKDoerIX1nNoqqQsPEaKQSnVP9jgWSiLNEwQluUZSqlKE177NK0dg--", "site_full": "unpuntomascanalla.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://unpuntomascanalla.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "UnPuntoM‡∏£‡∏ÅsCanalla", "title": "A finales de a‡∏£‡∏ëo, Bitcoin usar‡∏£‡∏Å el suministro el‡∏£‡∏âctrico equivalente al de un pa‡∏£‡∏çs https://t.co/RifKsW78VY", "title_full": "A finales de a‡∏£‡∏ëo, Bitcoin usar‡∏£‡∏Å el suministro el‡∏£‡∏âctrico equivalente al de un pa‡∏£‡∏çs https://t.co/RifKsW78VY", "published": "2018-05-16T21:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2e89bae788956db5d5cda375b041eb362f8d72a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcPrx8SPE9I.oAhZuy7JUKup2aWxiQclfHamqwJ6WgQiKUJtf5guAWSwKDoerIX1nNoqqQsPEaKQSnVP9jgWSiLNEwQluUZSqlKE177NK0dg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Juanma Pro (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T21:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "A finales de a‡∏£‡∏ëo, Bitcoin usar‡∏£‡∏Å el suministro el‡∏£‡∏âctrico equivalente al de un pa‡∏£‡∏çs https://t.co/RifKsW78VY", "text": "A finales de a‡∏£‡∏ëo, Bitcoin usar‡∏£‡∏Å el suministro el‡∏£‡∏âctrico equivalente al de un pa‡∏£‡∏çs https://t.co/RifKsW78VY\n‡πÇ‚Ç¨‚Äù TEcH ‡πÇÀú‚Ä¶ Gamer (@jvanmapro) May 16, 2018\nfrom Twitter https://twitter.com/jvanmapro\nMay 16, 2018 at 08:11PM\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ifttt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:41:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35262afd6bec8ab1b6026d25fe28bc741dac690c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXEdgVAcnG6UsQ604E9cl0w-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=217.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Collectibles", "title": "[FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 4.0 BITCOIN PLATED GOLDCOIN", "title_full": "[FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 4.0 BITCOIN PLATED GOLDCOIN", "published": "2018-05-16T21:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35262afd6bec8ab1b6026d25fe28bc741dac690c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXEdgVAcnG6UsQ604E9cl0w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WOLTAN78", "published": "2018-05-16T21:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "[FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 4.0 BITCOIN PLATED GOLDCOIN", "text": "d please", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:51:16.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "021b378b2100a9ba8ce59596c52de7f67e004dda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNMkchhcOVhynU3PuH_Hcs0ZE4dDORHzu6l7ZYaO82NS9icpRQFbH1QP_l4BeHeK6UgOEM2z1ry2eXcujtFA4SZ4yH40L24HA-", "site_full": "www.mirror.co.uk", "site": "mirror.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/rss.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Mirror -

clickbait advert, top right, on Yahoo Clicking through leads to fake news site RushDailyNews.com and the equally fake story headlined: ‚ÄúLord Sugar Abandons The Apprentice For New Software That Will Benefit Every British Citizen.‚Äù\nOutrageously, the story goes on to carry another picture of him with the caption: ‚ÄúLord Alan Sugar explains why Bitcoin Trader is the the future of crypto

‚Äì and if that doesn't get alarm bells ringing, nothing will.\n‚ÄúSome members earned their first million within just 61 days,‚Äù it claims, without explaining how this was done.\nStep three: the

are no details telling you who Bitcoin-Trader are or where they are based.\nRead More WARNING: Fake Mirror websites promoted on social media are being used as bait by Bitcoin rackets If you click to

platform, but before you can start you must fund your account ‚Äì in other words, send some money to these people.\nStep four: the crooks gambling site The platform says it lets you trade on the movement of prices of company shares, currencies and commodities such as gold and oil.\nSo it's all turned out to be nothing at all to do with investing in Bitcoin ‚Äì the word was just clickbait.\nThis website is just a common binary trading scam, where you can gamble on whether a price will go up or down over a given period, often just seconds or minutes.\nRead More \"I earn money

Sauf peut √™tre lorsque le quincailler se fait voler son stock, rapporte l‚Äôagence Associated Press . Entre les mois de d√©cembre et janvier, au fil de trois cambriolages successifs perp√©tr√©s en Islande, pr√®s de 600 ordinateurs de ¬´ minage ¬ª de Bitcoins et autres monnaies virtuelles ont √©t√© d√©rob√©s, pour une valeur totale de plus de 2 millions de dollars. Cette formidable puissance de calcul d√©di√©e, √† base d‚Äôasics con√ßus dans l‚Äôunique but de calculer des condensats, a peu de chances de se retrouver sur le march√© de l‚Äôoccasion. L‚Äôutilisation des machines procurera aux casseurs une discr√®te rente tant que durera la mode des monnaies virtuelles et tant que les tarifs d‚Äô√©lectricit√© au prix de gros ne seront pas li√©s √† une enqu√™te pr√©alable sur la nature et l‚Äôusage de cette √©nergie consomm√©e.\nLa part du co√ªt de cette √©nergie d√©pens√©e dans la valeur des cryptomonnaies pr√©occupe de plus en plus quelques associations d‚Äô√©cologistes et la majorit√© des m√©dias. Un ¬´ mineur personnel ¬ª, une fois achet√©e(s) la ou les CPU et r√©gl√© la note d‚Äô√©lectricit√©, a de moins en moins de chances d‚Äô√™tre rentable, ce qui explique la tendance g√©n√©rale √† la collocation des ressources de minage au sein de datacenters, eux-m√™mes situ√©s dans des r√©gions o√π l‚Äô√©lectricit√© n‚Äôest pas ch√®re. Au Canada notamment, explique Oilprice.com , l√† o√π la politique tarifaire d‚ÄôHydro-Qu√©bec cr√©e un v√©ritable appel d‚Äôair en faveur des nouvelles technologies. A l‚Äôorigine, ces tarifs pr√©f√©rentiels √©taient pratiqu√©s pour attirer des industries fortement √©nergivores, principalement la production d‚Äôaluminium. Or, l‚Äôh√©bergement informatique, quel que soit sa finalit√©, est un secteur d‚Äôactivit√© nettement moins cr√©ateur d‚Äôemplois que la m√©tallurgie. Plus mobile √©galement‚Ä¶ Qu‚ÄôHydro-Qu√©bec augmente ses tarifs, et ses clients mineurs iront s‚Äôexpatrier en Chine ou en Inde, pays qui pratiquent √©galement des tarifs attractifs estiment nos confr√®res Britanniques du magazine Express .\nMais alors, √ßa consomme combien , un Bitcoin ? le site Digiconomist fournit quelques m√©triques pas franchement r√©jouissantes (mais difficiles √† v√©rifier : pr√®s de 400 kg de CO2 par transaction, une consommation annuelle de 53 TeraWatt.heure, un co√ªt de fonctionnement de 2,7 milliards de dollars par an, pour une puissance de traitement de 25,5 Peta-Hash.seconde. Histoire d‚Äôillustrer cette d√©bauche d‚Äô√©nergie, cela correspond √† la consommation des ¬æ du continent Africain explique PowerCompare.com qui y va de ses propres statistiques dat√©es de novembre 2017. Plus gourmand que l‚ÄôIrlande, l‚ÄôIslande, l‚ÄôArgentine ou le Danemark , le Bitcoin et ses cousins contribueraient, au m√™me titre que les r√©seaux sociaux, au r√©chauffement de la plan√®te, pour le plus grand profit d‚Äôune minorit√© de sp√©culateurs.\nEntre les pessimistes , qui estiment que les monnaies virtuelles consommeront la totalit√© de l‚Äô√©nergie plan√©taire d‚Äôici deux ans (comme le confirme le Forum Economique Mondial ) et ceux qui pensent le contraire , il faut savoir aller chercher les vrais morceaux d‚Äôenfumage, d‚Äôalarmisme ou d‚Äôarguments sp√©cieux. Les uns se basent sur une croissance lin√©aire du ph√©nom√®ne, les autres sur un abaissement brutal de la consommation des processeurs (selon quels arguments techniques ?). D‚Äôautres, enfin, tablent sur un tassement de la valeur des cryptomonnaies, ph√©nom√®ne qui ¬´ calmerait le jeu ¬ª. Mais un tassement incite √† ne pas changer de parc informatique (un mineur milieu de gamme co√ªte entre 6000 et 10 000 USD) et aucun fournisseur d‚Äô√©nergie ne semble vouloir officiellement annoncer une augmentation de ses tarifs. A ceci doit-on remarquer que les seuls experts qui donnent leurs avis sont‚Ä¶ des gourous financiers, dont on peut douter des comp√©tences en mati√®re de micro√©lectronique, de thermodynamique‚Ä¶ et d‚Äô√©conomie, car ce sont en g√©n√©ral les m√™mes qui n‚Äôont su deviner la crise des subprimes ou les cha√Ænes de Ponzi de l‚Äôentreprise Madoff.

The Bitcoin asset management platform has designed this new product to cater to long-term hodlers.\nThe LedgerX Bitcoin 'Call Overwrite' Launched on May 15th, the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account enables investors to earn a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. Instead of hodling in the hope of a significant price increase, savers can now earn revenue from a call overwrite. Usually, overwrite contracts are for assets that are deemed to be undervalued or overvalued. The trader overwrites calls if the latter is the case and overwrites puts if the former is the case.\nWith this investment technique, traders deposit Bitcoin in their LedgerX accounts. The trader then sets a call option sold at a longer date with an accompanying slightly higher strike call option. LedgerX already offers similar trading techniques, but this new product makes the process a lot less complicated.\nThe new Bitcoin savings account will enable less finance-savvy investors to earn USD premiums on their Bitcoin holdings. Traders have the freedom to select both the number of bitcoins and the premium rate. Options contracts on the new account will be offered in both three months and six months duration. LedgerX will also charge a transaction fee for the product.\nCFTC Regulations LedgerX's new Bitcoin savings account is provided under license from the CFTC. The company has both the CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) and the swap execution facility (SEF) licenses . In an interview with Forbes , Juthica Chou spoke about the importance of being a licensed Bitcoin company. The LedgerX co-founder and CTO said that the company's products are all in compliance with statutory regulations. She also said LedgerX takes a deliberate approach to ensuring that it stays within the confines of the law.\nCommenting on the new product, Chou expressed optimism that it would become a favorite of the company's customers. The LedgerX CTO based her confidence on the current trading pattern already established in the company. According to Chou, more than 70 percent of LedgerX's trading volume comes from similar Bitcoin options contracts.\nLast quarter, the company also recorded a notional transaction average of $30 million per month. Another reason for Chou's optimism is the Bitcoin volatility which makes call overwrites an attractive investment strategy.\nWill the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account encourage more long-term holding of the cryptocurrency?

It‚Äôs a question that financial advisors increasingly hear these days.\nYet advisors, for the most part, don‚Äôt recommend investing in digital currency, or in the investment vehicles that have cropped up around it, at all. In fact, earlier this year, Merrill Lynch banned bitcoin buying across the firm. JP Morgan chairman Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù (he later softened some of his comments), and Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC in an interview: ‚ÄúYou will never see a fund from Vanguard on bitcoin.‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs no doubt that bitcoin has been wildly volatile, so for now, many advisors apparently remain wary and urge investors to avoid cryptocurrency investments altogether.\nMore from Straight Talk:Even if bitcoin crashes, blockchain is the futureMicro-investing builds wealth bit by bitHow to pick a new financial advisor\nLex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, thinks that is a big mistake.\n‚ÄúCryptocurrency is very controversial, but it‚Äôs really here to stay,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the underlying [blockchain] technology is really fundamental to the types of companies that people are building right now.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs important for individuals who want to invest in cryptocurrency to first understand what it is and also how blockchain technology works, Sokolin explained.\nTo be sure, one of the most compelling things about cryptocurrency is actually blockchain, he added. To that point, Amazon just announced that its cloud computing arm is partnering with a start-up called Kaleido to make it easier for customers to put their services on blockchain.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs volatile right now, so you should not just go and fill your entire portfolio with cryptocurrencies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it is a good way to add alternatives to your general allocation, something like 3 [percent] to 5 percent of your portfolio.‚Äù\nSokolin warned financial advisors that their clients are going to buy bitcoin whether they like it or not.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth Weekly advice on managing your money SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

Speaking at a cryptocurrency conference in New York, Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter Inc, reiterated his support for the virtual coin, but noted that not everyone within Square shared his views, including members of the board. \"We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology,\" Dorsey said. \"There is still a lot of skepticism, and still a lot of debate and disagreements and fights, but that is where the magic happens.\" He added that the \"healthy discussion\" around bitcoin extended \"all the way at the board level\", without elaborating on specifics. In January, Square, a San Francisco-based company largely known for its credit card processing hardware for small businesses, began allowing users of its consumer payment service Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin. The company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter. Proponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply. But it has failed to take hold as a payment for mainstream goods and services, in part because of extreme volatility, slow transaction processing, and widespread doubts about its long-term viability. The volatility of bitcoin and other digital currencies have, however, made them attractive speculative assets. The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that. Dorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own \"native currency.\" He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan,\" he said. A spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings. Dorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally. \"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.

While the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).\nBitcoin Faces Close Below Long-Term Support In First Since 2015\nAs a result,√Ç there is a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival.\n4-hour chart The bad news (for the bulls, at least) continues in the 4-hour chart. The downside break of the expanding channel (bearish breakdown) indicates the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed and could yield a drop to $7,524 (target as per the measured height method).\nNote, the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are sloping downwards (bearish).\nView BTC will likely close below $8,290 (50-day MA) today and confirm a bear revival. The cryptocurrency looks set to test support at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from April 1 low to May 5 high) and could go as low as $7,524 (expanding channel breakdown target) in the next 24√¢¬Ä¬ì48 hours. An unexpected break above $8,884 would abort the bearish view.

Since early 2016, Square Cash app downloads have averaged 128 percent year-over-year growth each month versus Venmo's 74 percent average monthly year-over-year growth, according to Nomura analysis.\nWith roughly 28 million cumulative downloads, the number of Square Cash downloads is just 1 million below Venmo's levels, according to analyst Dan Dolev.\n\"Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017,\" Dolev wrote to clients Wednesday, reiterating his buy rating on the stock.\nThe app appears to be getting an added boost because it allows transactions in bitcoin, the analyst noted.\n\"With Square Cash App now open for Bitcoin trading in most states, comparing its growth versus the popular Coinbase app is noteworthy,\" he added. \"Here, while Coinbase saw growth peak around the holiday time ‚Äì as Bitcoin prices spiked ‚Äì Coinbase's growth has slowed from record levels, whereas Square Cash App experienced more balanced growth.\"\nStill, Dolev has consistently lauded Square Cash as a potential revenue driver for the payment company. His 12-month stock price target of $65 implies more than 18 percent upside over the next year.\nThough Square said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter, it initially spent $33.9 million to purchase the cryptocurrency, netting a final adjusted revenue of just $200,000.\nShares of Square were unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday morning.\nDespite issuing guidance that fell short of Wall Street's expectations earlier this month, Square has outperformed the broader stock market over the past year, up 57 percent since January and 168 percent year over year.\nIn its first-quarter earnings report earlier in May, the payments company said it will continue to reinvest, focusing on revenue growth over profit expansion.\n\"Given the significant market opportunity ahead of us, we will continue to reinvest in our business to drive future growth,\" it said in a statement earlier in the month.\nGross payment volume grew 31 percent to $17.8 billion for the quarter, in-line with the growth rate seen in the fourth quarter.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dhdVLCF0XTa3yRBoUIZ6Ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/51015e696b17e2034680a1897ec9baa0);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dhdVLCF0XTa3yRBoUIZ6Ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/51015e696b17e2034680a1897ec9baa0"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square cash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nomura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura instinet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:49:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4d30ecaddb3e41851b8682646d6851b519e91a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8bIvfIsOGl7qTieoCxiVFj6L1Mm8Wk4GU5Y7nXHvhmwZUP1OVVAX1PcTBy06vRz613V.fKZUvi0iKgFLCQZyCimdnuZuJOCHuw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

How Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies Can Change The Real Estate World? 0\nCryptocurrency have taken rule over the world. Due to its innovative blockchain technology and secure encryption methodologies people love this concept. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, but only a few are getting hype such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their market values are rising higher and people are investing more and more in them. By seeing these trends, people are transforming their payment plan with these digital currencies. Beside E-commerce and other businesses, bitcoin escrow services can be used in the real estate world to digitize the whole mechanism.\nCryptocurrencies are not regulated, as there is no central bank or government controlling this digital currency. These currencies give freedom to people so people are putting more interest on them. After the success of cryptocurrencies, numerous famous e-commerce organizations have replaced their cash payment methodologies with cryptocurrencies. Recently, Amazon also have registered three cryptocurrency domains and is preparing to use digital currency as a payment plan. Beside these e-commerce business, a famous France base central bank is also planning to digitize their finance through bitcoin.\nAfter seeing this growing interest of organizations, it is being anticipated that cryptocurrencies may took over the real estate world. The probability of real estate business is higher so it would be a huge success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if real estate will also start trading with cryptocurrencies. Real estate organization can use Bitcoin Escrow to register their sites and get crypto domains.\nHow Bitcoin can help safe transaction in real estate?\nBitcoin transactions happen through blockchain technology. This technology is secure so real estate can trust blockchain mythology and can consider it for next transactions. If being used in real estate business, blockchain technology has the capacity to store property history, property details, credit history that prevent any fraud. The database can create secure profiles for the buyers and merchant, property agents, or the property which could conceivably make title organizations and representatives bankrupt.\nIt's conceivable that blockchain technology can be utilized to give a safe and traceable platform that can give a spotless record of proprietorship while decreasing the turnaround time for title looks. People can witness a huge change in real estate world by using Bitcoin Escrow services.\nCreate a place for fractional property possession\nIn real estate, people usually make huge investments. Blockchain technology can enable individuals to assemble their cash and make a joint purchase. As digital currencies and blockchain innovation turns out to be more standard, there could be a huge move in how individuals and organizations buy land. The high hazard unpredictability of buying digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) could guide individuals toward using less unsafe types of blockchain innovation.\nThese are numerous potential ways of utilizing Bitcoin Escrow services to make a change in real estate business using cryptocurrencies. By now, we don't expect any of these progressions to occur for a long while. The innovation is still in its beginning times and more research should be done to discover the limitations of blockchain technology. I am writing about cryptocurrency.

It‚Äôs an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.‚Äù The amount of energy required to support the bitcoin network has grown to 'epic proportions', according to Digiconomist founder Alex de Vries ( Digiconomist )\nPrevious calculations by Mr de Vries have been used to predict how long it would take for bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption to be unsustainable.\nAt one point during bitcoin‚Äôs rapid rise in late 2017, if the network‚Äôs growth had continued it would have required all of the world‚Äôs current energy production in order to support itself by 2020.\nVarious factors mean that this would never actually occur, however Mr de Vries warns that the network could someday consume 5 per cent of the world‚Äôs electricity.\nTo limit the impact of such energy consumption, some states in the US have put restrictions in place around bitcoin mining. Mr de Vries hopes his paper will be used to better inform policy in this area.\n‚ÄúI think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That‚Äôs quite debatable,‚Äù he said.\n‚ÄúI am hoping to get this conversation started. I‚Äôm doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.
