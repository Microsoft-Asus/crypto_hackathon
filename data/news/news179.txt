a real-world transaction was made using bitcoin. Source: Shutterstock\nThe day is an important one that helped to bring forth mainstream bitcoin adoption. On May 22, 2010, Florida based programmer and one of the first cryptocurrency adopters Laszlo Hanyecz paid someone 10,000 bitcoins to order him two pizzas from his local Papa John’s restaurant.\nThis was the first time time that the cryptocurrency was used in a real-world transaction as far as anyone knowns, creating what is now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. The value of those 10,000 bitcoins nowadays is close to $84 million.\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz famously said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times. “No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nHanyecz also christened the nascent Lightning Network (LN) with a similar purchase later on, but this time around it cost him only 0.00649 BTC (~$53). You could celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day today by going to a restaurant that accepts bitcoin directly as there are plenty of places around the country that now accept the digital coin as a form of payment.\nHave a great Bitcoin Pizza Day!\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2018/05/bitcoin-pizza-day/.\n©2018 InvestorPlace Media, LLC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/happy-bitcoin-pizza-day/", "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/?mtrref=undefined&gwh=F1E5D494D180447FCACB02CCBD39DC19"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin piz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T23:25:07.070+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e14cf3747f6a57469d75e99f2d6d34c28d686dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeQZFUASVd36Nfg9KpUDnsU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "title_full": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "published": "2018-05-22T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e14cf3747f6a57469d75e99f2d6d34c28d686dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeQZFUASVd36Nfg9KpUDnsU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SeXy", "published": "2018-05-22T21:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "text": "Good grade, it is the justice generation to shop championing and clasp Bitcoin and Ethereum, you contemplate in a duo of months, it will go high", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T06:37:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc1716ce97c49ebda2b1b3f5b9f7a13903df016c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa.N2DAsAWEli5AnX6zHI5W9jNsjCafLi9vZRJsVwkl7c0ifdyNhzSkHa_JAXmX1tDUJB41ic_GKnceGuNBaJN04Yul_6jbtrj", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day.

The Most Delicious Holiday of the Year", "text": "If you had 10,000 BTC what would you spend it on? A mansion? The oh-so-typical 'Lambo'? Two Papa John's pizzas? Well eight years ago an early Bitcoiner opted for the latter and on the anniversary of the now-legendary deal, he's absolutely no regrets!\nAn Expensive Slice of History? Eight years ago, on this very day, history was made. As far as we know, for the first time ever, Bitcoin was traded for something outside of the realms of software developers. Sure, the world's most popular digital currency had previously been gifted to folks, or a coin or two swapped for lines of code on various cryptography forums, but the anniversary we celebrate today marks Bitcoin entering the real world – traded for something visible, something tangible, something delicious!\nWe are, of course, talking about Bitcoin Pizza Day. If you're not familiar with the story, I'll recap. Back in 2010, early cryptocurrency miner Laszlo Hanyecz signed onto a forum and made what has since become a legendary post:\n\"I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas… Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.\"\nThe post continued, stating that the hungry cryptographer wasn't fussy about the origins of said slices – he would happily accept takeaway or homemade – the important clauses of the deal were a) the transaction had to happen in Bitcoin b) the food had to arrive at Hanyecz's home, and c) he didn't want to have to order or prepare the food himself.\nIt was a few days later when Jeremy Sturdivant replied to the post. He agreed to accept the deal and proceeded to place an order from his London apartment across the Atlantic Ocean to arrive at Florida-based Hanyecz's place. That was it. Bitcoin had just successfully proven itself as the permissionless, cross-border payment method it was intended to be.\nOf course, back in 2010 the 10,000 Bitcoin were worth a fraction of what they are today. In fact, according to the irreverent Twitter account 'Bitcoin Pizza,' the long-devoured disks of deliciousness were bought for over $83 million.\nThe #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!\n— Bitcoin Pizza (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2018\nHanyecz isn't phased by the vast appreciation of his payment, however. For him, mining was a hobby and he did get free pizza after all. The now 36-year-old told the U.K.'s Telegraph :\n\"I don't think it was a mistake. It's like if you could go back in time and buy Google stocks when they were $1 or something… At the time it wasn't worth much and I feel like if I hadn't done it, someone else would have. I wouldn't have spent $100m on pizza, right? But if I hadn't done that, maybe it wouldn't have become popular.\"\nIn fact, Hanyecz enjoyed his entry into the Bitcoin history books so much that he repeated his order this year. This time, he used the Lightning Network to order his munchies – again two pizzas. He personally feels that the software upgrade is what's missing from Bitcoin becoming a truly global payment network rather than a speculative investment that people are hoping will make them rich.\nEven though people love to make a big deal about the supposed value of the legendary Bitcoin pizzas being in the tens of millions today, it's not like Sturdivant ended up retiring in his twenties thanks to the deal.

They have presented it in such a way that the price of Bitcoin will not rise anymore. I think this type of promotion is very negative in the market.\nTheir joke is not okay because it can affect the bitcoin and the price of it.

A larger block size is good news in that it helps process transactions a lot faster, but it also means a full node takes up a lot more data storage space.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T06:34:57.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bcd66f856ddb50eab71c3e8b1ce7f0e31e10326", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaOt0k7ud4DglPTUuYLAZfc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "title_full": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "published": "2018-05-22T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bcd66f856ddb50eab71c3e8b1ce7f0e31e10326", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaOt0k7ud4DglPTUuYLAZfc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "maryjaysblog", "published": "2018-05-22T21:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "text": "Quote: from: Ziaderi33 on May 21, 2018, 05:25:14 AM seeing bitcoin prices go down and up, I'm a bit frightened to buy bitcoin at the moment, I judge I could lose, do you think, whether bitcoin prices can continue to go down, or even rise high?\nJust relax, it is a normal occurrence. it will rise again", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:05:06.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8d0515a1de31b7854625ca388163a05ba15d757", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeT1TOKUPaeslZSet8Lxtpo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Is your bitcoin earnings enough for you to start a business?", "title_full": "Is your bitcoin earnings enough for you to start a business?", "published": "2018-05-22T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8d0515a1de31b7854625ca388163a05ba15d757", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeT1TOKUPaeslZSet8Lxtpo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Elviragreg", "published": "2018-05-22T21:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is your bitcoin earnings enough for you to start a business?", "text": "I think it could make a profit from bitcoin to make business in the real world.

And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That’s all excusable, and there’s always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his. Yikes.\nAre you excited about BCH adoption and innovation?

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling for gains above $8,500 following concerns over increased regulation according to Naeem Aslam , chief market analyst at Think Markets: “The recent selloff has come from the news out of China that the ICO [ initial coin offering ] market is still very active and there are fears that China will further increase the strict regulation.” In a report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the government reiterated its position against “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraudulent behavior. The report compares the current climate to the early days of the internet, advising the public against “excessive speculation” and “false propaganda.” In addition to regulatory fears, hype surrounding a possible rally following Blockchain Week and the Consensus conference in New York was proven to be a dud. Co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee, who is famous for his bullish predictions on BTC price, admitted that his prediction of a post-conference rally was wrong. While gains above $8,500 are difficult to maintain, $8,000 support is still holding. According to Market Watch , as a the range tightens, the probability of a breakout is growing. For almost six weeks, BTC has traded between $7,800 and $10,000. At press time BTC is trading at $8,095 and has decreased by 4.25 percent over a 24 hour period. Ethereum (ETH) is is also down, trading at $653.79 down 6 percent over a 24 hour period at press time. Last week, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak compared Ethereum to Apple, saying it, “interests [him] because it can do things and because it’s a platform.”\nAltcoins are also all trading in the red. Litecoin (LTC) is down by 3.74 percent over 24 hour period at $129.78, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has lost 7.48 percent to $1,145. Also over a 24 hour period, both EOS and Ripple (XRP) are down 6.42 and 3.24 percent and are trading at $12.60 and $0.65, respectively.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-struggles-for-gains-as-range-tightens-2018-05-22", "https://coinmarketcap.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "naeem aslam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "possible new regulatory pressure bitcoin price struggles after blockchain week", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:58:16.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fef9945d785e63b11af8dedb779840c8d95ae0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdNxjEGfpQzbEd18xQscyMA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Or Altcoins?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Altcoins?", "published": "2018-05-22T21:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fef9945d785e63b11af8dedb779840c8d95ae0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdNxjEGfpQzbEd18xQscyMA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cryptolover8", "published": "2018-05-22T21:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Altcoins?", "text": "Who is best!

Its chief economist made the argument that the value of bitcoin could go to zero.\nJoseph Davis, the global chief economist and global head of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, wrote in answer to the question What do you think about bitcoin?:\nIm enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.\nIt is a stunning criticism of the largest cryptocurrency based on market value. Davis’s primary reason is that central banks could begin to regulate bitcoin and the trading methods that make its existence possible.\nDavis also argued that the value of bitcoin is not based on any real-world factors:\nThe investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use. The speculation creates volatility that, ironically, undermines their value as a currency.\nAfter a peak value of over $19,000 set in December, prices have dropped to $8,500. Based on past trading patterns of tremendous and rapid changes in valuation, volatility will continue to be a hallmarkof the market.\nThe value of the bitcoin market has topped $400 billion, so traders could see massive fortunes wiped out if Davis is correct.

Religious advisers at the Masjid Ramadan in Dalston, east London, have said the currency is halal if it is “transacted in a lawful manner”. There has been significant debate about cryptocurrency in the Muslim world, with figures including the Mufti of Egypt suggesting it is haram, or forbidden, because it is used by some for illegal activity. Because of its anonymous nature bitcoin has become associated with buying drugs and other unlawful items online. But the mosque has declared that Muslims can use it for their Ramadan donation, known as zakat. Muslims are meant to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth to charity during Ramadan, an annual donation which is compulsory for all but the poorest Muslims. The mosque, also known as Shacklewell Lane Mosque, will accept donations in two different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has received advice from Shoreditch startup Combo Innovation, a blockchain company which focuses on Islamic finance. The money is used to carry out repairs at the mosque, offer help to families who are struggling to pay funeral costs and shelter and feed the poor. Zayd al Khair, a religious adviser at the mosque, said: “Any money or currency is neither halal – permissible – nor haram – impermissible. “Guidance is about the value which it represents. If money is transacted in a lawful manner then it is halal. “We do not always know the source of cash donations, but we take these in good faith too.”\nWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

Bitcoin Energy, LLC is targeting an emerging millennial market that is more interested in blockchain technology and financial success than skateboards. The Bitcoin Energy drink ‘Liquid Assets’ launch party at the Coachella Music Festival Vamped event featured a private Sunday acoustic set by Justin Bieber along with a vast array of celebrities and social media super influencers and had attendees buzzing about the incentive and flavor of the new energy drink on the block.\nAvailable for sale beginning today, in a first of its kind promotion and available through Amazon, each Bitcoin Energy drink is given a code on the bottom of the can.

All of that takes smooth energy and the official Bitcoin Liquid Assets Energy Drink changes the game, providing healthy energy in a delicious, naturally sweetened drink with a hint of tropical fruit.

Two Pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins\nOn 17 May 2010, computer programmer Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the Internet a request to buy a pizza paying with bitcoins. A few days later, Hanyecz was successful. He bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins from Jeremy Sturdivant, whose username was “jercos.” On May 22, 2010, Hanyecz posted on Bitcointalk forum,\n“I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Thanks, jercos!”\nAs of this writing, 10,000 bitcoins equals USD $82,000,000. But when Hanyecz performed this transaction, he may have been unaware of its significance.\nSince then, Bitcoin has faced innumerable challenges. Governments and influential financial leaders have attacked Bitcoin relentlessly throughout its existence.\nScandals involving nefarious people using Bitcoin have often occupied the world press. Moreover, technical issues, including scalability and expensive transaction fees, have led the crypto community into a terrible civil war.\nHowever, Bitcoin has shown great resiliency and has successfully confronted all these challenges. Therefore, it remains the most successful ever currency.\nFor example, new technological improvements such as SegWit, Lightning Network, and Atomic Multi-Path Payments over Lightning, and now Bitcoin Core 0.16.0, are solving Bitcoin’s scalability and transaction fee issues.\nIn this regard, Hanyecz made another spectacular contribution to the development of the cryptocurrency by buying a pizza again on February 25, 2018. However, this time, he performed the transaction via Lightning Network. Hanyecz, reported this transaction as follows:\nI paid bitcoin using the lightning network, and he arranged for a pizza to be delivered to me. In this trade, my friend is just a middleman that is taking the risk of accepting lightning payments, but it demonstrates the basic premise of how this works for everyday transactions. It could just as well be the pizza shop accepting the payment directly with their own lightning node. The Transaction That Changed the World\nIndeed, the first-ever Bitcoin transaction changed the world of finances. Last year Bitcoin, escorted by futures trading contracts, entered into the circle of mainstream finance. This milestone event was formalized by the CBOE Global Markets’ launch of Bitcoin futures contracts, on December 10, 2017, easing the way to the cryptocurrency market for institutional investors’ trillions of dollars.\nAs a result, big banks and financial institutions are now aiming to trade Bitcoin. For example, according to Amber Baldet, former J.P Morgan executive, big banks will soon start trading cryptocurrencies. In a recent interview with CNBC, Baldet said, “I think it is coming sooner than people probably think.”\nGoldman Sachs might also be on the path of start trading Bitcoin. The New York Times writes :\nBut Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin exchanges, such as Coinbase and Ivy Koin are moving to obtain bank licenses. Reportedly, Coinbase is already introducing over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading services.\nToday, the world celebrates the anniversary of Hanyecz’s first Bitcoin transaction. The crypto community remains optimistic that Bitcoin will continue demonstrating resiliency, by outperforming all fiat currencies, even if articles with titles such as “Bitcoin is dead” will keep coming.\nHow do you think buying two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins has impacted the development of cryptocurrencies?

Try https://ift.tt/2A5g4Xf\nThe Tel Aviv District Court has received today an indictment against Halmi Git, a 33-year-old from the Palestinian city of Hebron, for a wide-ranging affair involving the management of forums for the sharing and sale of stolen credit card details. His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture\nStealing Even From the Moon\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of “fresh” credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers.\nHalmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone.\nApparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: “We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.”\n1,071 BTC Seized According to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him. In addition, Halmi acted consistently to disguise his identity by technological means, made many money transfers between different Bitcoin wallets for the purpose of covering his tracks, used online masking services to distance himself from his various accounts, and recorded parts of his property in the name of his relatives.\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office attributes to the defendant money laundering of at least 1,071 BTC, estimated at NIS 31,000,000. During the interrogation, in a precedent-setting move, the defendant’s Bitcoin wallet was seized and the amount found in it was transferred to a police wallet. The State Prosecutor’s Office intends to confiscate all the contents of the defendant’s Bitcoin wallets, if and when he is convicted. The case was investigated by investigators of the Israeli national cyber unit at Lahav 433.\nThe offenses with which Halmi is charged are: credit card fraud under aggravated circumstances (multiple offenses), receiving a thing fraudulently under aggravated circumstances, providing means for committing a crime, violating the Computers Law and money laundering.\nWhat should be the punishment for such an alleged crime?

In it, Davis wrote that there’s a high likelihood that bitcoin, which currently sits around $8,200, is going to become worthless. Yep, as in zero dollars per coin. As for why, Davis says:\nThe investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use. The speculation creates volatility that, ironically, undermines their value as a currency.\nBut that’s not to say Davis is a Debby Downer about everything related to bitcoin. He actually thinks blockchain, the underlying technology of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, will have lasting value:\nI’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.\nfrom FastCompany.com – Where ideas and people meet | Fast Company https://ift.tt/2s7gJ8S\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debby downer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:53:47.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28e460c656330d53600cbaf5a1a60f59fb4c91e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6k8buvh8KtyK4HMWsuvnHosuOp9bG9P8FR_3U8n3v7sg7GqkocLuFbCsnVm9TPgFEg-", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Bitcoin – Claim 0.25 – 1 Bitcoin – klopp interview", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Claim 0.25 – 1 Bitcoin – klopp interview", "published": "2018-05-22T20:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-1619.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28e460c656330d53600cbaf5a1a60f59fb4c91e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6k8buvh8KtyK4HMWsuvnHosuOp9bG9P8FR_3U8n3v7sg7GqkocLuFbCsnVm9TPgFEg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-22T20:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Claim 0.25 – 1 Bitcoin – klopp interview", "text": "how to grow your hair faster and longer with rice water milo moje sto te nema bugarka como grabar voces de trap uttar pradesh up chunav 2017 magic trick dollars come out your tablet bioenergy documentary tee grizzley first day out lyrics reaction tone it down clean chris brown video oficial felices los 4 abdominaux en 8 minutos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:13:23.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae57ae089e27183e7666817c10e16f196733872b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9jPQjuJgOPkxtFfRbnxXAqE4OUyanrJUgCBDUdeKDw1ETBYBKhA3RbtOcmzItPAm96G.e6IJ_L_B9A7LiXBHjrVo5LPvnhtUd_KeEBRqdETr3NKyLWlo843VxMT6Diii7I1WyLFjvQUW4td8clgjxYqrX7YpEPnt3rIIHavr8v6Q--", "site_full": "www.hackneygazette.co.uk", "site": "hackneygazette.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/cmlink/news_1_3818842", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "united_kingdom"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Dalston mosque becomes ‘first in the UK’ to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-currency", "title_full": "Dalston mosque becomes ‘first in the UK’ to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-currency", "published": "2018-05-22T20:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.5529907.1527011535!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae57ae089e27183e7666817c10e16f196733872b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9jPQjuJgOPkxtFfRbnxXAqE4OUyanrJUgCBDUdeKDw1ETBYBKhA3RbtOcmzItPAm96G.e6IJ_L_B9A7LiXBHjrVo5LPvnhtUd_KeEBRqdETr3NKyLWlo843VxMT6Diii7I1WyLFjvQUW4td8clgjxYqrX7YpEPnt3rIIHavr8v6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T20:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dalston mosque becomes ‘first in the UK’ to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-currency", "text": "Dalston mosque becomes ‘first in the UK’ to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-currency PUBLISHED: 18:52 22 May 2018 | UPDATED: 18:54 22 May 2018 Gurmit Singh, Erkin Guney and Zayd al Khair. Picture: Ipek Ozerim : Ipek Ozerim A Dalston mosque is thought to be the first in the UK to accept Bitcoin donations, to tap into a potentially phenomenal amount of worldwide cash throughout Ramadan.\n Shacklewell Lane Mosque. Picture: Erkin Guney\nLeaders at the Masjid Ramadan have made the decision to also accept another popular crypto-currency, Ethereum, to try and get urgent repairs carried out at the mosque in Shacklewell Lane.\nThey want to benefit from Muslim crypto-currency users who are obliged to give away 2.5pc of their wealth to charity during the 30-day Muslim festival. Known as Zakat, or Zakah, the annual donation is compulsory for all but the very poorest Muslims.\nThe mosque, a registered charity, hopes to raise at least £10,000 in crypto-currency donations over Ramadan. Erkin Guney, the chairman of the board of trustees, told the Gazette: “We are hoping to bring the attention to the Muslim world we need support. I’ve grown up around here and I have watched the community grow and the challenges it’s faced with - it’s a struggle, with housing, food, the cost of funerals and government changes. We are trying to appeal to a wider audience with the new money. It’s big in the Islamic world, and we have set up a platform for wealthier Muslims outside our community to support and donate to our mosque.”\nThe founder of blockchain technology start-up Combo Innovation, Gurmit Singh, has advised the mosque on how to receive, store and sell crypto-currency safely. Gurmit Singh, Erkin Guney and Zayd al Khair. Picture: Ipek Ozerim\nDonations can be made on the mosque’s website, and will be transferred to the bank’s crypto-currency hard wallet which will be visible for all to see. The donation will then be traded for sterling through a currency exchange like LocalBitcoin UK.\n“If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1pc of Bitcoins – or £1.04bn – then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due,” said Mr Singh.\n“It’s likely the actual figure is much higher.

Eight years ago, on May 22, 2010, a programmer purchased two large Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, worth about $30 at the time. It’s widely believed to be the first purchase of a product with bitcoin, proving the then-nascent cryptocurrency’s potential as a means of payment.\nBitcoin was less than two years old when Laszlo Hanyecz decided to spend some of the coins he had mined on some real-world goods. The coins were worth just a fraction of a cent at the time, and no merchant accepted them as a means of payment. So he posted on the main gathering place for bitcoiners at the time, the Bitcointalk forum:\nI’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!\nAnother user, who went by “jercos” on the forum, took Hanyecz up on his offer. Hanyecz sent the bitcoin to jercos, who then placed the pizza order. The transaction had to be finalized over internet relay chat, according to the Bitcoin Wiki . Since then, the price of bitcoin has taken off, and those two pizzas would be worth a lot more at the going rate for 10,000 bitcoins. How much more? Roughly $82 million for the order, or more than $4 million per slice:\nThis February, Hanyecz made a similar transaction, sending about $67 worth of bitcoin—that is, 0.00649 of a bitcoin—to a friend in London for two pizzas delivered to him in Florida. The coins were sent over the Lightning Network , a system that bitcoiners hope will keep bitcoin transaction fees low.\nHanyecz’s point with making another pizza purchase? To prove that bitcoin could remain a viable payment system with the addition of the Lightning Network. “Maybe eventually pizza shops will have their own Lightning nodes and I can open channels to them directly,” he wrote on the mailing list for Lightning developers.

Yes, it may not be able to overcome the $10,000 psychological limit and go back down, but we will hardly see $6,000 again, analysts say.\nThere are also some very optimistic experts about the future of the cryptocurrency.\nFor example, according to Rodrigo Marquez, CEO of Atlas Quantum, one of the Brazilian cryptocurrency trading platforms, a drop below $8,000 for the bitcoin can be identified as a finding of the bottom. He expects the bitcoin to go up and reach the psychological limit of $20,000 in six months.

No other date, save for January 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the genesis block, is more symbolic. It was on May 22, 2010 that Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Eight years on, the occasion has become part of bitcoin's mythology.\nAlso read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition\nRemembering the $83 Million Pizza On May 18 2009, Laszlo posted a thread on the Bitcointalk forum entitled \"Pizza for bitcoins?\" In it, he explained: \"I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.

Within days he had a buyer and the deal went through on May 22. The event is symbolic, not so much for the value of those 10,000 BTC today, but because it marked one of the first public instances of bitcoin being used as a means of payment. The pizza thread, like the value of BTC, has since grown and grown, and today runs to 73 pages, having been viewed around 750,000 times.\nPizza Wallets and Pizza Moon Missions Every year on May 22 the bitcoin community now competes to despatch the best pizza tweets and branded products, all tied to that then-minor but now massive day in 2010 when bitcoin proved its worth. It hasn't stopped proving it ever since. To mark the occasion today, Bitstamp has calculated how far $83m of pizzas would stretch, using the following formula:\n10,000 BTC * 8,400 USD (1 BTC) = 84 million USD\n84 million USD / 15 USD (1 pizza price) = 5.6 million pizzas\n5.6 million pizzas * 14 inches (diameter of a large pizza) = 1237 miles\n1237 miles / 248 miles (average altitude of the ISS) = 4.9\nPIZZA TO THE MOON: In 2010, a Florida man bought two large pizzas for 10.000 #Bitcoin . Today, this could buy you enough pizzas to get to the International Space Station five times. #whenmoon Happy #BitcoinPizzaDay ! #BTC #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OuPeXC93CM\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 22, 2018\nHardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has gone one better, creating a limited edition Pizza Day Nano S. Just 1,337 of the units will be issued, each coming in a special Laszlo's Pizza box complete with a sachet of red chilli pepper oil, for those who like to spice up their cold storage.\nAs for the man who made this infamous anniversary come about, history records that Laszlo sold most of his bitcoins at around $1 apiece but, having contributed to its early source code, and done his bit to ensure real world adoption, he regrets nothing.

A customer comes to me from Africa and he is desperate to get a container load of frames costing $20,000.\nI will of course say, “Pay me up front” and my new African customer says, “Sure.”\nI am now ten days away from getting the money. They might take a day or two to get their paperwork straight, perhaps as much as a month. The paperwork we have to go through at our end is a nightmare and it may or may not show up as expected and it may or may not cost a couple of percent in forex charges and various other charges. Heaven forbid it’s a big order and we need a letter of credit.\nAll sorts of things can go wrong. The letter of credit can be fake.

Then six months later the untested customer can call their credit card company and say they never bought the goods and we get a huge chargeback and have lost not only the profit but the principle too.\nSo instead we say, “We take Bitcoin” and they say, “Fine.”\nThen a few minutes later we have notification the payment has been sent. There is no going back for that money. A few minutes later we have the full amount confirmed and if we have our cryptocurrency ‘ducks in a row’ the fiat is on the way in another few minutes.\nThat is an electrifying improvement in business process and it is real, today, right now.\n“But,” the no-coiners say, “Bitcoin has a high cost, not the few cents it was meant to have.”\nThat can be true, but for this B2B order $50 is not an issue. The worst lag of say, one day to get the cash at the worst performance last year when Bitcoin was going mad, is nothing to the wait in conventional banking, and now the pandemonium over transaction times are back down to minutes and costs to a few cents again.\nYet even then the fact that you can see the money on its way for sure is a huge benefit over the \"pay and pray\" system of international interbank transfers.\nFor B2B transactions and international ones, Bitcoin is a tremendous tool. As a businessman I would prefer to be paid in Bitcoin now than paid in slow, expensive to process fiat that might arrive at some indeterminate point in the future.\nThis is an extremely valuable \"use case\" for Bitcoin and it is the crypto coin’s liquidity not price that is the value.\nI do not care if Bitcoin is $100 or $1 million a coin. So long as I can get it and convert it in a few hours, it’s absolute value is of no importance to me. You might think the price volatility is an issue, but moves can go either way so they cancel out over time and my holding period is short, so I have no material exposure to this volatility on average.\nSo forget the revolutionary hype, which is real, and instead focus on the value add.\nThis single Bitcoin use case is a huge benefit to a business that wants to be agile. It telescopes order processing, it brings cash payments forward, it lowers risk and it decreases work.\nThis single example of valuable functionality that pioneering companies are exploiting today is why the cryptocurrency revolution is real and why it is no magic money, smoke-and-mirrors craze.\nSo rest assured when you hear people say that Bitcoin is a scam with no purpose to exist, they are very wrong.\nBitcoin is a fantastic B2B tool for companies looking to be as agile as possible.\nClem Chambers is the CEO of private investors Web site ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich , The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:10:07.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1af73b411eb9c32dfa8f0211f1a0d108350ac8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseAJuWdVex5PbPyZPE_fljkcfdUsvSpiLy96EGvZa2QPkLDGMXvdWdDe2GaaBJBa8Rc42HPy2UmIulWoGzq.1mkYA8MeJB0hki7", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/markets/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes - Markets", "title": "Bitcoin Is For Agile Companies", "title_full": "Bitcoin Is For Agile Companies", "published": "2018-05-22T20:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F1095803603%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 70, "comments": 0, "shares": 70}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1af73b411eb9c32dfa8f0211f1a0d108350ac8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseAJuWdVex5PbPyZPE_fljkcfdUsvSpiLy96EGvZa2QPkLDGMXvdWdDe2GaaBJBa8Rc42HPy2UmIulWoGzq.1mkYA8MeJB0hki7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Clem Chambers", "published": "2018-05-22T20:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Is For Agile Companies", "text": "Time and again you will hear that Bitcoin is magic money that has no use or purpose and has no intrinsic value.

PHOTO | JENS KALAENE In Summary Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency worth about $123,000. This case appears to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency. In March, US hackers demanding a ransom payable in bitcoin attacked computers of the Atlanta city government. By AFP\nMore by this Author A gang who kidnapped a South African teenager from a playground at the weekend have demanded a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency worth about $123,000, police said Tuesday.\nThe 13-year-old boy was taken in the eastern province of Mpumalanga while he was playing with friends near his home and was driven away by captors in a car. \"We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank (town),\" police spokesman Leonard Hlathi told AFP. \"There was a demand that was made that the parents should deposit cash in bitcoins,\" he said, declining to give further details.\nLocal media said the ransom note was left at the scene. \"We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child's safe release — non negotiable,\" read the reported note. This case appears to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency.

In honor of that purchase, the crypto world celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22. Watch bitcoin trade in real time here . Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!\nOn May 22, crypto enthusiasts around the world celebrate the anniversary of one of the earliest bitcoin purchases: two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.\nLaszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, purchased the two pizzas in 2010 from another person in Jacksonville, Florida, according to The New York Times. In an interview with the newspaper in 2013 , Hanyecz didn't sound too broken up about the deal.\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\" Hanyecz said.\nStill, those coins would be worth $82 million at bitcoin's Tuesday price of $8,200 a coin, according to Markets Insider data . There's a Twitter account that provides a daily update on how much the pizzas would have cost based on the latest price of bitcoin.\nBitcoin Pizza More Twitter/@bitcoin_pizza\nBitcoin gained worldwide attention at the end of last year as it soared close to $20,000 a coin and infiltrated trading and investment firms across Wall Street. But its origins trace back to 2008 and an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, whose vision was to create a rival financial system based on a technology called blockchain.\nStill, many merchants are wary of accepting bitcoin because of its spine-tingling volatility. Last year, Morgan Stanley described the lack of places to buy goods with bitcoin.\n\"The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin's rapid appreciation is striking,\" the analysts wrote .\nThat hasn't kept Wall Street away. Several top trading firms are active in crypto markets, including DRW and Virtu Financial. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin-trading operation , and Morgan Stanley has been looking to beef up its equity-research unit with crypto experts .\nNOW WATCH: BlackRock's $1.8

The sentiments come as a surprise given that many high profile investors that had similar views over the past year have had a change of heart.\nBitcoin (BTC) appears to be struggling for direction after an explosive 2017 that saw it rally by almost 1,200 percent. After dropping below the $10,000 mark, the cryptocurrency has struggled to bounce back arousing concerns as to what the future holds.\nSo where is bitcoin headed? That's the big question, which continues to baffle the industry amidst mixed sentiments. While most people remain bullish about the underlying technology, Blockchain, that powers bitcoin, the same cannot be said about the digital currency itself.\nJoe Davis. Source: LinkedIn\nBitcoin Headed To Zero Vanguard's Global Chief Economist and Global Head of Vanguard Investment Strategy, Joe Davis believes the price of bitcoin is headed to Zero. The sentiment comes as a surprise given that many high profile investors that had similar views over the past year have had a change of heart.\nHowever, Mr. Davis is backing his thesis with many factors that he believes will play a pivotal role in the price of the popular cryptocurrency tanking to zero .\nCryptocurrencies vs. Currencies There has been a lot of discussion as to why cryptocurrencies are currencies of the future. How true that is, is still a point of debate. There is no doubt that just like traditional currencies, virtual currencies do qualify as units of account as they can be used to measure the value of goods and services.\nCryptocurrencies also qualify as a medium of exchange. However, there' are a limited number of vendors that accept them as a means of settling transactions. Increased levels of volatility had all but stifled their adoption, something that Mr. Davis believes will continue to haunt bitcoin prospects and sentiments going forward.\nFiat currencies act as a store of value something that cannot be said about bitcoin despite being the largest cryptocurrency. Price volatility is expected to continue undermining its adoption a headwind that the Vanguard executive believes will continue to hurt its price going forward.\nRegulations Headache Regulation poses the biggest threat to cryptocurrencies, even though most of them do qualify for niche purposes. According to Mr. Davis, Central banks pose the biggest threat to bitcoin prospects. Given that most of them have already started to research on blockchain-based currencies raises serious concerns.\nStringent regulations on exchanges have already started to crop up, something that Mr. Davis believes does not provide a suitable environment for the success of virtual currencies. The fact that some central banks are contemplating creating and adopting their digital currencies all but spell trouble for bitcoin, which was developed with the aim of replacing fiat currencies and reduce the influence of governments.\nThe fact that the new digital currencies would be legal tender, recognized as a form of payment for all debts and charges, could significantly affect bitcoin adoption in the mainstream sector.\nGiven a choice between blockchain-based dollar and bitcoin, most people are likely to go with the former.\nBitcoin as an Investment Contrary to perception, bitcoin is not an investment. Unlike other financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and currencies, bitcoin does not generate cash flows such as dividends or interest payments. Another deficiency of the popular cryptocurrency has to do with the fact that its price is not derived from any underlying economic activity.\nBitcoin price is not based on any economic fundamentals, and its price tends to move up and down on speculation. The value of the digital currency has mostly been undermined by the high levels of speculation that makes it be volatile thus unstable.\nBitcoin value is not tied to the blockchain. The cryptocurrency is merely an investment in blockchain whose value will always be based on speculation.\nA lack of cash flows with bitcoin investment as well as extreme volatility all but explains why Davis remains pessimistic about bitcoin as an investment and its long-term price.\nThe post Vanguard Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Implosion to Zero appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global head of vanguard investment strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard economist warns of bitcoin implosion to zero vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linkedin bitcoin headed to zero vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:09:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4739f4bce047ecc31efe6c54c3b3e175ba24f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdTACdKRCbhoZgc89rWuj.Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "let us promote BITCOIN", "title_full": "let us promote BITCOIN", "published": "2018-05-22T20:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4739f4bce047ecc31efe6c54c3b3e175ba24f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdTACdKRCbhoZgc89rWuj.Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bohxz M4p4gm4h4l25", "published": "2018-05-22T20:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "let us promote BITCOIN", "text": "It seems like a good thing to campaign for bitcoin.

I signed up for bitstamp and clicked the fund with credit card option and it is saying that I need a card that is 3D secured. I looked into it and apparently you actually have to order a whole new card to have this. I then decided to just fund from my bank account. I typed in all of the information and before I hit send I saw that my bank wanted $45 dollars to do the wire transfer on their end - what the hell?\nThere's gotta be a better way. Can you guys recommend an exchange that takes credit cards that I can actually use?\nthanks\n submitted by /u/soverign5\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T15:09:04.023+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 14309, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=17900", "requestsLeft": 483}
