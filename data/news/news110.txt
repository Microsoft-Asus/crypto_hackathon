South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand (US$80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialized, police said on Friday. The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2% per day, 14% a week and 50% in a month, the police said. A search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended. The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response. “Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement. “Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than US$50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. “This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly US$120 000 to release a South African teenage boy. Last week Thursday, South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations. -Nampa/Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T09:03:08.352+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22aa252ecc065f327a8a3c012d91cf9815800dc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdz3bfZgVG.9yyoGwJmg1EQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin & future", "title_full": "Bitcoin & future", "published": "2018-05-29T01:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.115, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22aa252ecc065f327a8a3c012d91cf9815800dc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdz3bfZgVG.9yyoGwJmg1EQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "G_Besar", "published": "2018-05-29T01:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin & future", "text": "if you look at its development we can not deny that bitcoin has occupied a high price in the world of digital money and everyone wants to have but if you look at future bitcoin than I personally think that bitcoin in the future will have a good role that can benefit its users", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T23:28:32.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9846e7a1fe195476de36fccc23be757a04023643", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoGNlghdcdmHXqbqLMoyQDMvDpjgWu9zK2fQPqN8O3HYyof2cmYcQ5HuXMIlsfsHFcUhgzypkuvWhFy_gE6YUWKVOVnJWIVOyMWR7hHdUs4kx038vCz2AIjEWWJexXptKP9ivmtXJhkmiEx5bKiBO89dNeNivVNcVw-", "site_full": "gibcosta.com", "site": "gibcosta.com", "site_section": "http://gibcosta.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gibcosta", "title": "Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) Will Issue Strykz Token for FIFA World Cup – Bitcoin Exchange Guide", "title_full": "Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) Will Issue Strykz Token for FIFA World Cup – Bitcoin Exchange Guide", "published": "2018-05-29T01:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9846e7a1fe195476de36fccc23be757a04023643", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoGNlghdcdmHXqbqLMoyQDMvDpjgWu9zK2fQPqN8O3HYyof2cmYcQ5HuXMIlsfsHFcUhgzypkuvWhFy_gE6YUWKVOVnJWIVOyMWR7hHdUs4kx038vCz2AIjEWWJexXptKP9ivmtXJhkmiEx5bKiBO89dNeNivVNcVw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GibCosta", "published": "2018-05-29T01:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) Will Issue Strykz Token for FIFA World Cup – Bitcoin Exchange Guide", "text": "Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) Will Issue Strykz Token for FIFA World Cup Bitcoin Exchange Guide The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange also aims at building a topnotch institutional-grade token sale platform that will operate under a licensed stock exchange with the participation of investors, traders and companies.

I&a;nbsp;don&s;t know, but if so, that would motivate the miners even more.&a;nbsp; Again, I&s;m not sure whether this activity, if it exists, would meet a legal definition of manipulation for any charges to be brought.&l;/li&g;\n&l;li&g;We have seen and heard of manipulation in actual markets – from LIBOR to FX.&a;nbsp; Many are actually regulated.&a;nbsp; Here, to my knowledge, regulation is light if it even exists.&a;nbsp; &l;strong&g;Some traders took the time and effort to establish accounts on various platforms to &s;arbitrage&s; price differences.&a;nbsp; They should be (and likely have been) rewarded for their efforts.&a;nbsp;&a;nbsp;&l;/strong&g;In a fragmented market, where many participants only took the time to set up on&a;nbsp; one or two exchanges and didn&s;t have the patience or willingness to do more work to ensure price transparency, they likely pay a price that goes to those who did that.&a;nbsp; But, like much else about crypto, I would be shocked if it ended there.&a;nbsp; &a;nbsp;Why not try and &s;push&s; markets around?&a;nbsp; Create the dislocations?&a;nbsp; It seems completely logical that someone would try to do this.&a;nbsp; Again, I&s;m not sure this is manipulation (unless done in the futures), just like I wouldn&s;t think it would be criminal manipulation to attempt to move the price of Beanie Babies on E-Bay (beannie babies ebay is apparently not an uncommon search).&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ol&g;\nI am more shocked that anyone would be surprised that manipulation likely occurs in cryptocurrencies and their pricing. I will be interested to see how this investigation can proceed on things that occur on platforms I don&s;t view as regulated&a;nbsp; exchanges on&a;nbsp;products that I didn&s;t think were securities.\n&l;strong&g;For now, this is yet another reason to expect cryptocurrencies to continue to drift lower.&a;nbsp; They are losing support and more and more of the issues with them are being exposed – further slowing the rate of adoption.&a;nbsp;&l;/strong&g; Even knowing that manipulation occurs, whether indictable or not, doesn&s;t mean I can&s;t get bullish cryptocurrencies again, but certainly not right now.&a;nbsp; I would be more confident the market can weather these times of headlines if crypto had been able to rally after the&a;nbsp;#Consensus2018 conference, &l;a href=&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertchir/2018/05/18/consensus2018-fails-to-pump-up-bitcoin/#4c527f5c2f4a&q;&g;but it didn&s;t&l;/a&g;.\nI expect the headlines surrounding ICO&s;s and &s;tokenization&s; in general will be equally problematic in terms of&a;nbsp;encouraging&a;nbsp;new investors to get involved or existing&a;nbsp;holders to add more.

I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.\nFast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.\nWhen Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.\nI was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.\nWhen Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\nToday, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.\nAfter a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.\nThe next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.\nSpeaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.\nMy body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.\nALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.\nToday, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.\nIt has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support \"Trusted Computing\", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.\nAnd of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.\nThat's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.\n[edited slightly]\nI never met him, and he doesn't know me, I live in the other part of the world, I came across this story a year or so ago, but he left a big place in my heart, and I find the timing depressing.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T10:29:52.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ac03a4c6406d61fb5b78a6b392190901dc6159f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmb2IPSW6I26PsMiaZyOO_ug-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is it too late?

London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin", "text": "Updated: May 28, 2018, 9:25 PM IST Photo for representation (image: Reuters) LONDON: Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramzan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation – in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said. Egypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s … accepted by a group of people …. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

The survey was a fake, and respondents were actually sending their personal details back to Grant so that he could sell them to the dark black market – the phishing scam alone netted West £180,000 or $240,000 which he then converted into Bitcoin. BBC reports that the scam cost the Just Eat company £200,000 or $265,000.\nWest also directly targeted over 100 other companies including major firms like Barclay’s, Asda, Ladbrokes, Uber, and British Airways, hacking them for more customer data to sell. His Barclay’s attacks resulted in West’s clients fraudulently removing £84,000 or $110,000 from customer accounts and costing the bank £300,000 or $400,000 to remedy through new security measures. Similarly, West cost British Airways £400,000 or $530,000 after he hacked Avios accounts.\nHe reportedly used the money to pay for a new Audi worth £40,000 or $53,000 and several trips to Las Vegas among other luxuries.\nWest was arrested in 2017 on a first-class train to London in September 2017. Detectives from the Scotland Yard cybercrime unit chose the moment to end their two-year investigation carefully, making sure Grant was logged into his computer so and grabbing his arms before he could log out of his heavily encrypted cryptocurrency wallets and dark web accounts, which otherwise would be very difficult to link to him legally.\nOn the laptop, which belonged to West’s girlfriend, police found the financial information of 100,000 people. A subsequent raid on his home revealed an SD card with the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards as well as 7 million email addresses and passwords, along with £25,000 or $33,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis, which West was also selling on the dark web.\nWest went by the username Courvoisier, after the top-shelf brandy, selling stolen information and drugs on the now-defunct site Alpha Bay. He pled guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offenses on 2 May and on Friday May 25 Judge Michael Gledhill sentenced West to 10 years and eight months in prison.\nPolice accessed and seized over £500,000 or $667,000 worth of ill-gotten Bitcoin from West’s girlfriend’s device, and she was sentenced to community service for unauthorised access of computer material – however, according to Judge Gledhill, over £1.6 million or $2.13 million worth of West’s cryptocurrency is still unaccounted for.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post London Police Seize

major investment scam has threatened to sue, unless the priority crime investigating unit retracts its statement.\nLawyers representing BitCaw Trading stated on Monday that the company was not aligned to BTC Global, as the Hawks claimed in their media release on Friday.\nThe lawyers said that BTC Global was a “completely separate entity”.\nThis comes after the Hawks announced that BitCaw Trading and BTC Global were the same company , and were being jointly investigated for a scam that may have fleeced up to 28 000 investors out of R1-billion.\n“BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third party money or offer any kind of investment returns,” states the letter. “BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a Bitcoin Investment company and has nothing to do with our client.”\nThe lawyer’s letter further states that should the Hawks not retract their contention that the two companies are one and the same, and post the retraction by close of business on Tuesday, “our instructions are to approach the South Gauteng High Court on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients’ rights”.\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin: a pocketful of cryptonite\nHawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi told Fin24 that the Hawks had received the letter of demand from BitCaw Trading, but said that because the investigations were ongoing, the Hawks would rather wait for the courts to decide if they had erred, than retract their statement prematurely.\n“We got the letter. We knew that they would go to the media. We will take it on in line with the due process. We believe that it is good that people want this to be clarified by the courts, and we will handle it there. As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise,” said Mulaudzi.\nREAD MORE: ICOs: the lawless land of cryptocurrency fundraising\nMulaudzi told Fin24 that the Hawks had sufficient evidence to support their statements regarding the matter.\nHe said the company’s rights would be protected if they had indeed been aggrieved. However, he added, the Hawks would not compromise on pursuing justice for the victims said to have been swindled by the business.\n“This is not something we are prepared to be swayed on. You have up to 28 000 victims who have already approached the Hawks. What about them? If we don’t look after them, who are we supposed look after? I am more concerned for people like the poor lady who called me crying about why she has to pay over a thousand dollars to get sum she is entitled to,” he said. — News 24\nKhulekani Magubane Read more

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

Take a look at this graph: Since its inception, Decred has grown around 11600%, rising to #30 in market cap.\nSince the beginning of 2018, many big altcoins had huge losses in growth, including Ripple, which lost 34% of their average market cap, and Nano, which lost 64.17%, while Decred grew 23,02% Also, this is the Rate of Change in relation to Bitcoin for Ripple: Decred is, financially, in a really good position right now. And when saying that Decred is the new Bitcoin, it’s not as a “silver standard” like Litecoin.\nDecred is coming to be the Bitcoin 2.0 we need. Besides having a relatively similar history and being developed by the team which developed the btcsuite, we could also say that DCR is a coin which serves for the same purpose like Satoshi’s does, and shares most of its good qualities, but added with some tweaks a lot of people thought were essential.\nDecred’s core fundamentals were actually based on an opinion piece published in 2015 outlining Bitcoin’s biggest challenges: governance, funding and powerful miners having too much influence on the blockchain. All of these three problems are solved with Decred’s clever hybrid consensus system.\nThat said, autonomy can be said to be the core of their mission. There is no central authority for decision making, as stakeholders are the ones who set the rules through voting, in a process which is intricated to their hybrid mining-validation system which is, yes, another main feature of Decred.

Speaking to FT recently, FIGC Market Standards Board chairman, Mark Yallop dismissed cryptocurrencies market for its lack of scale. He said, \"Their overall size, even in aggregate, is so small that they are too small to be of relevance in wholesale markets.\"\nIn keeping with this picture, the entire city seems to have adopted a wait-and-see strategy for the future of crypto, viewing it as too much risk for too little available reward with little or no solid underpinning to provide a measure of assurance.\nThis particular investment mindset looks to be one that can only change if bitcoin or one of its many competitors can achieve mainstream public adoption. As it stands, illustrated in the graph below, this may be quite some way off happening.\nBitcoin Transactions. Source: Blockchain.info\nSpeaking further, Yallop said, \"UK market participants have been very cautious in engaging with them (cryptocurrencies) because of fears about their vulnerability to fraud, financial crime and other 'conduct' risk categories.\"\nDue in part to bitcoin 's pseudo-anonymous nature and its reputation for potentially enabling private transactions, London's forex traders have been very reluctant to enter the cryptocurrency trading market. There is a partially justified fear of in some way allowing illegal money movements or otherwise getting mixed up in illicit transactions involving everyone from Russian mafia organizations to bad state actors.\nOf course, this does not mean that nobody in London trades crypto. Spread betting firms like Plus500 and IG Index enable cryptocurrency derivatives, but the catch is that market movement that users track for investment decisions are driven primarily by centers in Asia, principally China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. In the capital of global currency trading, one very significant category of forex trading is at the mercy of Asian market forces.\n\"Unusually Strict Regulation\" Self-regulation is only half of the story of why London is slow to warm up to crypto. The other half of the story is that government and banking institutions involved in London's finance have very restrictive policies regarding cryptocurrency trading. As mentioned earlier, financial centers in Germany and the US are making headway toward mainstreaming cryptocurrencies, while Tokyo on its part enables the ecosystem by regulating crypto exchanges.\nIn London however, the story is very different. Speaking to FT, Max Boonen, formerly of Goldman Sachs, now CEO of B2c2 had this to say, \"Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto. It's nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks had issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.\"\nUK authorities and banking institutions tend to look at bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a sense of suspicion and a general lack of clear direction about how exactly to go about regulating it. The ongoing disruption of strategic coordination with Europe caused by Brexit negotiations probably does not help in creating a reliable and workable plan for cryptocurrency trading regulation in the UK.\nThe good news is that London may be waking up from this self-induced crypto summer. Speaking in March 2018, Bank of England governor Mark Carney indicated that future regulation of cryptocurrency would hold crypto exchanges to the same standards used by securities and equity trading. In his view, would address a critical loophole in present laws. To this end, a joint team of officials from the Treasury, BoE and the FCA is set to collaborate later this year on a document that lays out a blueprint for the financial industry to trade cryptocurrency assets safely and legally.\nFuture Opportunities According to Oliver Robinson, a director of Markets Regulation at AIMA , London stands to offer a unique set of opportunities if Digital Assets trading is fully normalized in the UK. In his opinion, the same advantages provided by the City in conventional trading – a central time zone, a stable legal system and a skilled talent pool – will play a significant role in bringing London to the forefront of crypto asset trading.\nTabb Group analyst, Monica Summerville goes further. In her opinion, if London's banks decide to engage with the cryptocurrency trading market, it would set off a chain reaction that would take the entire industry to a new level. She says, \"There is a wall of institutional money just waiting for the right conditions — such as adequate technology and regulatory clarity — to enter the market''.\nOnce London's financial establishment makes a move into crypto, and institutional investors follow suit, the probability is that the City will become Europe's undisputed center for digital asset trading, and will mount a challenge to Asia to become the global cryptocurrency center. However, this remains a considerable ask because according to the BoE in a statement to the UK Parliament on May 24, \"There [is] little appetite on the part of banks to take direct exposure to the crypto-asset market in any significant way in the medium term.\"\nThe post London Sticks With Fiat: Here's Why Bitcoin Has Not Caught Up In The World's Forex Trading Capital appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T00:24:37.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7269a1fd94593aa82cceefc2bca92008b791accc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGtjJ0utEKXynz_56I_O5.pSWnudzHiFR_RziEc2aF1KXp7RgxB1_WIJAWjd6W_RXA3YaNnEJJT83Pq1aK3Mzj5A-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "What makes money… “money”?

Despite the fact that bitcoin has dropped below the $8,000 and has suffered its worst three-week performance since Q3 2017, now’s not the time to retreat. Bogart, a former equity analyst, told CNBC that investors are getting it wrong and instead of unloading BTC should be kicking overbought altcoins to the curb.\n“If the story erodes and it’s not there, then I’m not going to be bullish on bitcoin. But the long-term thesis is very much intact,” Bogart said, adding that while bitcoin could face some headwinds in the short-term, his minimum horizon for bitcoin trading higher is one year.\nBogart admits that he can’t predict how the bitcoin price is going to unfold in the short-term, and he’s in good company, as bitcoin bulls had been predicting a rally by now. But looking out into the next year or two, the use cases for bitcoin become clearer. For instance, he points to a one-two punch comprised of the institutionalization of bitcoin coupled with currency crises that are unfolding in countries like Venezuela as the catalysts for bitcoin’s longevity.\nAnecdotal signs of bitcoin’s future include the robust turnout during blockchain week in mid-May as well as the major banks that are looking to implement blockchain into their operations in some way including supporting trading in the leading digital currency for clients.\nBogart’s Book While Bogart is bullish on bitcoin, he doesn’t place a rating any higher than hold on the leading altcoins and in fact believes that certain coins are a “sell”. He rates Ethereum a “hold” and points to potential headwinds surrounding the ICO coins that are linked to the network. “Those tokens are overvalued,” he said, noting how ether is the fuel to power the Ethereum network.\nIn addition to ETH, Bogart also attaches a “hold” rating on Ripple, Roger Ver’s favorite coin Bitcoin Cash and EOS. He believes that Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO are overbought and therefore has a “sell” rating on those altcoins. TRON is nearing its migration away from the Ethereum blockchain and onto its own MainNet.\nWhat Gives? If there’s one thing that bitcoin has proven in its short history is that it’s a volatile asset. Market participants who have been around since the early days can tell you the recent pricing pressure is nothing new. But what sets this bear market apart, as CNBC panelists pointed out, is the $314 billion market cap for the broader cryptocurrency market. A key difference in this market downturn, Bogart noted, is that market participants no longer have to be reassured that bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Venture Capitalist Makes a Bullish Call: Bitcoin is a Screaming Buy appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/25/forget-alt-coins-just-buy-bitcoin-says-blockchain-capitals-spencer-bogart.html?play=1&quot;", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/25/forget-alt-coins-just-buy-bitcoin-says-blockchain-capitals-spencer-bogart.html?play=1", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QO983ULl6MRnwr4LBWa9Pg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/9f2a777b9e4956ce7554106e6a91b4fa", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6E3KERzmkzZhXJMhe7KH0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/72edb6a1021e9555006a84f8a24250b0", "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/72edb6a1021e9555006a84f8a24250b0", "https://www.ccn.com/venture-capitalist-makes-a-bullish-call-bitcoin-is-a-screaming-buy/", "https://www.ccn.com/venture-capitalist-makes-a-bullish-call-bitcoin-is-a-screaming-buy/&quot;", "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/72edb6a1021e9555006a84f8a24250b0&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6E3KERzmkzZhXJMhe7KH0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/72edb6a1021e9555006a84f8a24250b0);"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:02:53.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe472a48bb3fe1e83ff14603ed2196641ca5ba3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVWwKspf_DfAyVAjL.0wN9HprQ41Byf4TJft6LKCnQjg7Ve3M5GA3jA8oUUXLmlKNtjMvHx6oF8iRr7rWIM5iBcRkcIOV4nH.umEEA0rXWfldgRAmzFvFt.4AgS.IDlWw-", "site_full": "mycryptofeed.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://mycryptofeed.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin: “2018 January – May” Everything started in January. – Crypto Feed", "title": "Bitcoin: “2018 January – May” Everything started in January.", "title_full": "Bitcoin: “2018 January – May” Everything started in January.", "published": "2018-05-29T00:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe472a48bb3fe1e83ff14603ed2196641ca5ba3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVWwKspf_DfAyVAjL.0wN9HprQ41Byf4TJft6LKCnQjg7Ve3M5GA3jA8oUUXLmlKNtjMvHx6oF8iRr7rWIM5iBcRkcIOV4nH.umEEA0rXWfldgRAmzFvFt.4AgS.IDlWw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mikeyoung318", "published": "2018-05-29T00:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: “2018 January – May” Everything started in January.", "text": " submitted by /u/yenilmez86\n[link] [comments] from Bitcoin – The Currency of the Internet https://ift.tt/2sfnshT\nvia IFTTT https://ift.tt/2LEcvP1 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T00:17:19.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "213fe3f9b98c3f0b9ff81ef9f06cfa90219c3250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRGk_vTO9FCEp_UwRkAszNY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin is dead?", "title_full": "Bitcoin is dead?", "published": "2018-05-29T00:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "213fe3f9b98c3f0b9ff81ef9f06cfa90219c3250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRGk_vTO9FCEp_UwRkAszNY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zippolo", "published": "2018-05-29T00:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is dead?", "text": "how can a coin that costs more than 5000 thousand dollars be dead and have a capitalization incomparable with any cryptocurrency in the world?

As an investment opportunity, it was seen as one of the largest gold mines in 2017. Still, many questions remain, namely in terms of risks, as Bitcoin becomes increasingly mainstream. Answering these questions is extremely important for all cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin is the clear pioneer and frontrunner of blockchain technology.\nThis is what we would like to address in this article, looking at three major risk factors that Bitcoin will have to face down in 2018. For those interested in more information, they can check out ExpressVPN’s Bitcoin: Ultimate Security & Privacy ebook . Hacking & Theft\nBitcoin hacks have received worldwide attention from small-time criminals hacking computers to possibly rogue government-backed attacks on major exchanges. It took the industry years to develop sound practices and properly take security into account because of the difficulties involved. This is because unlike traditional financial networks which can rely on trusted custodians, Bitcoin relies upon blockchain encryption. This basically means users can only rely on themselves to secure their assets through the use of wallet technology. Backups can further enhance this security. Regulatory Risks\nHowever, risks facing Bitcoin are not exclusively technical or criminal in nature. When exchanging Bitcoin or investing speculatively, physical security aspects and compliance issues may need to be taken into account. For example, lost of Bitcoin stored in hardware is a definite possibility that was played for laughs by American sitcom Big Bang Theory in November 2017, but is actually a serious issue. Furthermore, regulatory changes and restrictions may also impact Bitcoin prices, with trade requiring counterparty and regulatory risk assessment for it to be truly safe. Systematic Collapse\nLastly, as Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) are a new financial product, and one that lacks the backing of any trusted institutions, there is a risk of systematic collapse. With its value based upon trust and provided by the masses, one must have to consider the possibility, however remote, of Bitcoin collapsing on its own. It is also possible for governments, banks, or major institutions to simply flood the Bitcoin market with miners, forcing others out of business.\nFor answers to these risks and more, remember to check out Bitcoin: Ultimate Security & Privacy .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/expressvpn-publishes-bitcoin-security-ebook/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T11:52:43.057+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc09327df29c6717d4e975878f95d4a37bd33ced", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQlUAzC69kbPZ._cq1KHo5s-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "title_full": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "published": "2018-05-29T00:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc09327df29c6717d4e975878f95d4a37bd33ced", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQlUAzC69kbPZ._cq1KHo5s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alex M", "published": "2018-05-29T00:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "text": "No, I don't think so it is just a rumor where some people are spreading in there own interest it has nothing to do with the reality bitcoin will never die .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T23:27:04.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b901179f222ebab0c2b2420b75fa4ba1b89a3bf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTw9_nIT_Ds_oRMx6d.CxlA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Will 2018 be better than 2017 for bitcoin", "title_full": "Will 2018 be better than 2017 for bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T00:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b901179f222ebab0c2b2420b75fa4ba1b89a3bf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTw9_nIT_Ds_oRMx6d.CxlA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ufalo3", "published": "2018-05-29T00:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will 2018 be better than 2017 for bitcoin", "text": "Considering the actual size of the market and everything that is going on behind the scenes, i can say only one thing; no.\nMaybe the price of everything will recover next year, but i do not think that it will happen this year", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T22:41:11.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62d29318ba9fe3f77e7cfa0d54dcc3b8fb4e5ec8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5qj82kJRG0sldw7DTmhpmOBdBAtz0VDfwXohvV.kx8Ysjq3qWqyT1ogOyU_K4DeaEtjLQtekSRDYNgu_w8s5hwBA6xUVHrRTluUcG1c7XZSb", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Thank YOU Roger Ver for pumping Bitcoin Core Coin!

While there are several reasons why BTC fees are low, one of them is obvious: less people are using the network. The number of daily transactions has dropped sharply since last year, and has declined further in the past month.\nAlso read: Blockchain Projects Live a Little Over a Year on Average, China Claims\nLower Fees, Lower Usage It is no secret that the number of on-chain bitcoin core transactions, along with those of other blockchains, has dropped significantly since late 2017. This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , “Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed”.\nThe number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send On May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit’s role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction.\nMedian BTC fees are at their lowest in years On the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they’ll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.\nDo you think BTC fees will stay low, or is this just a temporary dip?

The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n\"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n\"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\"\nCastle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency.

Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem.

London mosque now accepts bitcoin >> Reuters Published: 2018-05-28 20:35:12.0 BdST Updated: 2018-05-28 20:35:12.0 BdST Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n\"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n\"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said.\nEgypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision.\n\"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

Written by: Published on: May/28/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from Georgia will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL GEORGIA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nGeoriga is among those states least likely to allow sports betting as they currently are devoid of any gambling or horse track betting activities.\n“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the decision. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. ”\nNeedless-to-say, Georgia gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nStill, there are those who believe the recent Supreme Court ruling will help pave the wave for casinos in the Peach Tree State.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:42:29.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4adda6139d128f5fbcf950088050bdfaf8fb0a8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8vPZA6toGHh_4M7y2RJicAQi.Y33JMAHiro0jSOaSVGlXLhzrboRpESYhGZq7olYXFYvhSiXrx8vR6H3vmUgcCnSzzcNAoB9ZNwF6J8ysSl7pjXnS_Pzta4HiFet.S7I-", "site_full": "uk.reuters.com", "site": "reuters.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/UKVideoLatest", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Reuters Video: Latest Videos UK", "title": "INSIGHT: Mosque accepts bitcoin for Ramadan", "title_full": "INSIGHT: Mosque accepts bitcoin for Ramadan", "published": "2018-05-28T23:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?d=20180528&i=RCV0052QN&w=1200&r=RCV0052QN&t=2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4adda6139d128f5fbcf950088050bdfaf8fb0a8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8vPZA6toGHh_4M7y2RJicAQi.Y33JMAHiro0jSOaSVGlXLhzrboRpESYhGZq7olYXFYvhSiXrx8vR6H3vmUgcCnSzzcNAoB9ZNwF6J8ysSl7pjXnS_Pzta4HiFet.S7I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T23:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "INSIGHT: Mosque accepts bitcoin for Ramadan", "text": "INSIGHT: Mosque accepts bitcoin for Ramadan 9:23pm BST -
