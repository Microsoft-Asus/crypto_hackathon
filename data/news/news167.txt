According to Nasdaq , Twitter CEO’s payment company Square has recorded a P/E ratio of 1,052 in 2018 in the US stock market while software company Hubspot recorded a P/E ratio of 388.\nCanaan, best known for its bitcoin mining equipment line Avalon, has been able to secure more than 15 percent of the global cryptocurrency mining equipment market share and evolve into one of the few competitors against Bitmain.\nJianping Kong, the co-chairman at Canaan, said in early April during an interview with Reuters that its affordable mining equipment has appealed to large-scale mining pools in regions like Norway, Canada, and west China, where cheap electricity is readily available due to an abundance of clean energy. Related: Are Markets Showing Signs of A Topping Pattern?\nKong also emphasized that the company has purposely planned for an IPO outside of mainland China to sustain its global brand and distributors outside Asia. Other major conglomerates based in China such as Oppo and Lenovo have shifted away from targeting mainland China and focused on expanding their ventures globally.\nInitially, Canaan wanted to conduct its IPO in mid-2016, when the cryptocurrency market was still at its infancy. But, the company had to cancel its plans to pursue an IPO in mainland China because of a regulatory deadlock. Kong noted that the case was irrelevant to the crackdown on bitcoin by the Chinese government and local financial authorities, adding that IPOs in mainland China often take longer periods to materialize than other regions.\nIn late 2017, the Chinese government officially banned cryptocurrency trading and investment, requesting local cryptocurrency exchanges to halt their services. Local analysts attributed the controversial decision of the Chinese government to its fears in regards to capital controls and its national currency yuan leaving the country to other major regions like the US.\nChina has generally been optimistic towards blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency industry, as seen in the government’s reluctance to crackdown on mining companies and mining equipment manufacturers like Bitmain and Canaan.\nRelated: Iran Looks To Bitcoin As Rial Tumbles\nMore importantly, in May, the Chinese government released its public blockchain rankings that ranked Ethereum as the best blockchain network in the world based on its applicability and technology. Analysts suggested that if the Chinese government cracked down on the cryptocurrency industry due to their decentralized nature, it would not have ranked an open and decentralized blockchain network like Ethereum as the top blockchain protocol.\nProfit Margins to Drastically Change\nSeveral studies in South Korea and Japan have revealed that in a period of volatility, it is a better investment to purchase mining equipment and produce cryptocurrencies rather than directly investing in digital assets like bitcoin and Ethereum.\nMany investors in South Korea have started to run cloud mining software on their GPUs and ASIC miner racks, to produce emerging cryptocurrencies with small market caps.\nThe rise in demand for cryptocurrencies and the exponential growth rate of the blockchain sector could allow a company like Canaan to also demonstrate rapid progress in the long-term.\nBy Joseph Young via Crypto Insider\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nasdaq.com/g00/article/3-popular-tech-stocks-with-insanely-high-pe-ratios-cm921692?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmF0Lw%3D%3D&i10c.ua=1&i10c.dv=14", "https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cannan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jianping kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit suisse group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hubspot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter ceo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmb international capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:31:43.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0f6e09aa3ad964e1b2354b9cfc0b2eedd9aedf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ48bRRRNYAz.9QFlLucS7WjoiqA5D.rB6qN437K569.yhg3jgTMlsspv66FWVu33CiE3Cui3UQmwnEJVJ.KDayUzmZN8CKvKTbND5h4P4c2Sc_qbTcyMIs", "site_full": "theverycoolstuff.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://theverycoolstuff.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Very Cool Stuff", "title": "This bitcoin explainer created by AI is hilariously insane", "title_full": "This bitcoin explainer created by AI is hilariously insane", "published": "2018-05-23T17:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0f6e09aa3ad964e1b2354b9cfc0b2eedd9aedf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ48bRRRNYAz.9QFlLucS7WjoiqA5D.rB6qN437K569.yhg3jgTMlsspv66FWVu33CiE3Cui3UQmwnEJVJ.KDayUzmZN8CKvKTbND5h4P4c2Sc_qbTcyMIs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bella Parmi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T17:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "This bitcoin explainer created by AI is hilariously insane", "text": "\nLook, understanding cryptocurrency can be confusing.

"Bitcoin – A Hands-On Review of the Keepkey Hardware Wallet 23 May 2018 8540\nHardware wallets, like the cryptocurrency stored within them, can provoke strong emotions in their owners. Hodlers like what they like, and that’s the end of the matter. If the first hardware wallet you bought was a Ledger, you’re probably Ledger for life. Likewise if you’re in Team Trezor. Keepkey, which completes the holy trifecta of hardware wallets, is less famous than its siblings, but the sleek black plastic device still packs a punch.\nAlso read: A Review of the Swiss-Made Digital Bitbox Hardware Wallet Is Keepkey a Keeper?\nAt Consensus New York, my budget wouldn’t stretch to the €49,000 diamond-encrusted Nano on display, but there was space in my bag and my heart for a Keepkey. At $129, it’s a little pricier than the Ledger Nano or Trezor One, but cheaper than the swish new Trezor Model T. I should probably add a warning at this stage, incidentally: the review you’re about to read is painfully long, which is a reflection of how long it took to get this damn wallet working. But we’ll get to all that in due course. First, let’s start at the start…\nEver since last year, Keepkey has been the property of Shapeshift, who bought up the company, enabling Keepkey users to exchange between cryptos without exposing their private keys online. Keepkey promises “bank-grade security,” whatever that means, and a system so easy that “even your grandmother can protect her bitcoin wealth,” which seems a little patronizing. If gran was smart enough to buy bitcoin, she’s surely got the perspicacity to work a paper wallet. Beauty Is in the Eye of the Behodler\nIt’s funny how much form, rather than function, influences our purchasing decisions – even when we’re purchasing a cryptocurrency wallet that’s destined to be consigned to the dark recesses of a safe. Beauty is in the eye of the behodler, but there’s a strong case for asserting that Keepkey’s hardware wallet (they only make one) is more fetching than a Trezor, and arguably smarter than the Nano too, even if it lacks the latter’s brushed metal exterior. The Keepkey Chrome app.\nVisit the Keepkey store and you’ll find just two products to choose from: a single, regular Keepkey and a box of 50 which retails for $6,450. Perfect for the security conscious trader who likes to keep their shitcoins on separate sticks in separate vaults. The lightweight and plasticy feel of the device is somewhat tempered by the quality of the USB cable that comes bundled with it. It feels luxurious to the touch, but it’s here, after installing the Keepkey Chrome browser app, that I encounter my first problem: it has a standard USB connection but my Macbook Pro does not. That’s Apple’s fault, not Keepkey’s, but it’s a bummer when you’re on the road, as I found myself at the time of writing this review, and thus without access to a USB-thunderbolt adapter. Cables. Cables everywhere. Third Time’s a Charm\nAt home, 24 hours later, I plug the hardware wallet into my laptop via the thunderbolt adapter, but there’s no sign of life. I’d expected a USB drive to show up on my Macbook Pro, or for the Chrome app to display a notification and the Keepkey to light up, but nope. Not a peep. Figuring it might just be the thunderbolt adapter, I try connecting the device to my old Macbook Pro, which has a USB port, but still nothing. Then I try my Chromebook, and once again, nothing. In a moment of inspiration I google “keepkey setup” and salvation arrives.\nAccording to Keepkey’s Get Started page, you need to first open the app by “navigating Chrome to chrome://apps/”. This is less than intuitive, but is partly Chrome’s fault for having a crappy UI that conceals extensions and apps behind submenus. This does mean, however, that every time you go to use your Keepkey (if you’re as disorganized as I am) you’ll need to google “keepkey setup” to remind yourself of how you get into the damn thing. Wait, Not So Fast… The Keepkey interface is simple but functional.\nHaving successfully gotten my Chromebook to update the Keepkey, I decide to reconnect it to my Mac and see if the laptop can now detect it. It can, and am prompted to set up my PIN and then write down my 12-word recovery phrase. I’ve written it down once, and am just preparing to jot down a second copy when the device inexplicably disconnects and I’m forced to start the whole process all over again. After re-entering my PIN twice, I begin jotting down the new recovery phrase, when the same thing happens. Keepkey and my thunderbolt adapter can’t seem to get along, so I resignedly reconnect it to the Chromebook.\nEventually I succeed in finding the apps section of Chrome by pasting the URL into my browser, whereupon I’m prompted to hold down the button on the Keepkey and plug it in to update the firmware. When that’s done, I’m presented with a screen showing a BTC wallet set up by default and nothing else. I hit the plus sign to add a BCH address and then scan the QR code from my Bitcoin.com wallet. I select $5 of bitcoin cash and send it to my Keepkey address. The fee is 3 cents. While I’m waiting for the transaction to clear, the Keepkey logo lurches across the screen in instalments. It reminds me of the handheld monochrome soccer game I played as a kid. Anachronistic, but comfortingly nostalgic. The Bitcoin.com wallet Nice Device, Now How About Some Altcoin Support?\nI like the design of Keepkey, and I like the cable, if it’s possible to have affection for a USB cable, while the software is passable. Is the device capable of challenging Trezor and Ledger? Sure…provided you’re happy to hodl namecoin, doge, and dash. 2016 just called and it wants its altcoins back. In fairness to Keepkey, there is at least BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC support and native ERC20 token support is currently in beta so should eventually arrive. Given some of the ERC20s I’m embarrassed to own, it’s probably for the best I didn’t get a chance to screenshot them in this review. One Keepkey, now equipped with bitcoin cash.\nKeepkey’s biggest weakness right now, as its team are undoubtedly aware, is the shortage of coins that can be stored on it. While the market leaders are pressing ahead with monero support, Keepkey is still way behind the curve. It would be great to have EOS, cardano, zencash and maybe some ripple for the ladies. It’s odd that there’s support for the 295th coin by market cap (namecoin), but room for just six out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies – or top 100 if you wanna make that statistic even more damning.\nI’ll certainly keep using the hardware wallet, using it to store any spare BTC, BCH, and ETH I amass, but a device so easy that “even grandmother” could use it? Please. My grandmother could have mined the genesis block and she’d still struggle to connect this thing to her Chrome web app. I’ll keep my Keepkey, but in my heart I’ll be lusting after one of those diamond encrusted Nanos I saw at Consensus. Hell, I’d even settle for a regular one.\nHave you tried the Keepkey wallet and if so how do you like it?

Buzz60 Even offerings that are legitimate should be viewed as highly risky. \"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" said Joe Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association. Why are people ponying up money after repeated warnings about the dangers of ICOs? \"People are afraid to miss out on the latest and the greatest,\" Borg said in a press conference on Monday in Washington, D.C. Many times, retirees and others can fall for these schemes because they're trying to make up for lost time and rebuild underfunded nest eggs, said Borg, who is the Alabama Securities Commission Director. Some consumers who never recovered from the stock market crash in 2008-09 can be lured into sending money — even using digital currency — on nothing but the promise of quick, sizable returns. Regulators said \"Operation Cryptosweep\" has uncovered roughly 30,000 domain names relating to cryptocurrency. Many were registered in the past year as the price of Bitcoin went bonkers. Bitcoin — which had been valued around $1,400 in early May 2017 — rose above $19,000 by December. Bitcoin has since dropped significantly in value to around $8,400 on May 21 but the buzz continues to build. CLOSE After a brutal start to the year for cryptocurrency investors, Bitcoin bounced back big time in April. Is it here to stay? Time In some cases, fraudulent websites have used photos of popular personalities. The Texas State Securities Board shut down one initial coin offering site in early May that regulators claim used photos of Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities as part of fake endorsements. Joe Rotunda, NASAA Enforcement Section vice chair and director of Enforcement for the Texas State Securities Board, said fraudsters often use false claims that a well-known public figure or a celebrity is associated with an initial offering as a way to encourage potential investors to send money. One fraudulent effort, he said, even used a photo of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to sell cryptocurrency. Some signs of a scam: Promoters promise lucrative returns tied to cryptocurrencies but manipulate photographs, possibly using stock photos available elsewhere online, in seemingly professional, polished presentations online. Christopher Gerold, NASAA Enforcement section chair and New Jersey Securities bureau chief, said state regulators used some old-fashioned detective work, including undercover tactics, to try to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency schemes. Gerold said most, if not all, promoters do not have the proper licenses for selling such investments. Contact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.

Also, during the boom of late 2017, there were supposedly huge backlogs of new investors trying to get onto exchanges, they all anounced restrictions on new accounts in a seemingly coordinated way, and since then, there has been nothing, no public updates from exchanges regarding new sign ups etc... The CEO of Binance claimed they signed up over 100,000 new accounts in a 4 hour window at one stage. If all this was true, how is it that more money has left crypto than has entered?\n submitted by /u/censorship_notifier\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:25:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "883421b9f572c418a42f6c0eeac4460adff4d520", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSqtjEFW08Pt54olUnSujhI1BZuwaB9yWE8mlfrgWlN02uCU1Xw29dBMjs0eJTPjKoVh2su7r.ZtZ3Vk3TYzODkXPCY4ayfQTddpp0IUlFrI5E20ISmHwzlw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "reddit: the front page of the internet", "title": "Pre-Market Update - Bloody Markets / PayPal Interested in Bitcoin / Ashton Kutcher Donates w/ Ripple : ethtrader", "title_full": "Pre-Market Update - Bloody Markets / PayPal Interested in Bitcoin / Ashton Kutcher Donates w/ Ripple : ethtrader", "published": "2018-05-23T17:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.075, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "883421b9f572c418a42f6c0eeac4460adff4d520", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSqtjEFW08Pt54olUnSujhI1BZuwaB9yWE8mlfrgWlN02uCU1Xw29dBMjs0eJTPjKoVh2su7r.ZtZ3Vk3TYzODkXPCY4ayfQTddpp0IUlFrI5E20ISmHwzlw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DarkestChaos", "published": "2018-05-23T17:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pre-Market Update - Bloody Markets / PayPal Interested in Bitcoin / Ashton Kutcher Donates w/ Ripple : ethtrader", "text": "submitted by /u/DarkestChaos\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/a9G7a2zkaLY"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:27:40.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a30fe29f608118dee59997f9480934194d68e523", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaG9b9uEKRwuN5AL8lvZJSzSq0Sm0GE6XiydE0lRztCDVfAMnmlRPQSpTKynSgKko0bdpIAT8Bp80saNvY_yoriQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "reddit: the front page of the internet", "title": "Bitcoin drops because of ICO regulatory fears : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin drops because of ICO regulatory fears : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-23T17:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a30fe29f608118dee59997f9480934194d68e523", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaG9b9uEKRwuN5AL8lvZJSzSq0Sm0GE6XiydE0lRztCDVfAMnmlRPQSpTKynSgKko0bdpIAT8Bp80saNvY_yoriQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Babad00k123", "published": "2018-05-23T17:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin drops because of ICO regulatory fears : CryptoCurrency", "text": "Recently I've read quite a few articles, presumably written by people who don't know much about Crypto, that Bitcoin dropped, or has seen pressure due to \"new ICO regulations\" in some country somewhere:\nI've no idea how they connect a diving BTC price with ICO regulations.\nI for once would appreciate the idea quite a lot to cut down on ICO's. ICO's are no good to Crypto. Funny thing is that we can one day see 1.000.000.000.000 market cap and still every coin is in loss..\nWhy? Because ICO's prevent money from going into the market. If there is 1.000.000 going into the market as USD or USDT, people can buy quite a lot of different coins with that. --> Good.\nIf Shitcoin A does an ICO, collects 1.000.000, a few things happen.\nMoney flows OUT of the market, to the adress of the Shitcoin creators.\nShitcoin creators wanna make big bucks and sell thei ETH or BTC on the market, creating pressure on other coins prices\nShitcoin holders are - sometimes - stuck with their coins, unable to trade, for quite a while --> Money is away from market.\n--> Two negative effects.\nA new shitcoin enters the market, diluting the total amount of cryptocoins out there --> Also taking away possible volume from other coins.\nPeople wanna sell their shitcoin because they realise its shit and therefore prices of Shitcoin falls, turning the 1 million people initially invested, into maybe half a million.\nSo how about we cut down on the ICO's and yall do it like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg did it. Start with a few bucks, build a product and then convince investors, instead of collecting 100 million dollars for a half decent business idea that doesnt even need a blockchain.. remember, not everything needs a blockchain.

Basically there is no regulations for btc trade that I know of outside of exchanges protecting their servers. – marshal craft Oct 7 '17 at 11:28 up vote 0 down vote\nIf you have a lot of purchasing power (relative ) it is possible to manipulate the price. Say you wanted to sell btc. You could put up limit orders to buy btc at the highest price possible, every time a market order to buy btc comes in it will match with the lowest open sell limit order until it buys up the size it was for and is instant. So if you saw that market order come in and it uses up all the lowest price sell limit orders and there is remaining size left, it goes up to the next lowest order and begins matching with that one. This opens it up to now place a buy limit order at the same price of what that sell order was.\nIf you have the capital to spend, the price goes up and up. Now most of your orders don't actually have to complete they are just place holders grabbing spots when available. You can probably get more complex to guard against your buy limit orders actually completing, and if they do well your driving the price up so you can sell at a higher price just detect possible ponzi scheme environment where you have to buy more btc than you can sustain and sell in driving upwards.\nThis is what actually is driving btc price I'm willing to bet most times. Some of the problems which make this possible I think is gdaxs slowness to add or remove btc and fiat. This creates inter market boundaries which greatly reduces the capital necessary to influence the market. With out these boundaries, people would make the markets as efficient as possible. They would take advantage of local market price differences and be able to have profitable arbitrage position. And this controlling the btc price would require large enough capital investments to drive all btc prices up and in the mean time people profit in matching those markets.\nAlso the markets units of time in my opinion are the market orders. The extent to which the market can be persuaded and how long it takes is determined by market cap and volume traded. This is less susceptible to manipulation because there are fees for market orders.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gdax", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T22:47:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b02971aa661bc22f0432d1b8058b6ec8fcd1e66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC.lrE1sxj9KdXyWLsDz4d6JYQ8stmaF9ku.URCwssa75o52k6.aDwrrZ9h5JobBh675H9q9THJk0Kt26QI7C5gGutl1aZa5FJ3CAsBh7GUn_y8f6XAiCQJw-", "site_full": "www.newsr.in", "site": "newsr.in", "site_section": "https://www.newsr.in/latest/Markets.htm", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Markets: newsR", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 23", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 23 - newsR", "published": "2018-05-23T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.033, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsserve.net/700/i/20180523/3744-Bitcoin-Ethereum-Ripple-Bitcoin-Cash-EOS-Litecoin-Cardano.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b02971aa661bc22f0432d1b8058b6ec8fcd1e66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC.lrE1sxj9KdXyWLsDz4d6JYQ8stmaF9ku.URCwssa75o52k6.aDwrrZ9h5JobBh675H9q9THJk0Kt26QI7C5gGutl1aZa5FJ3CAsBh7GUn_y8f6XAiCQJw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsr.in", "published": "2018-05-23T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 23", "text": "Wednesday, 23 May 2018 ( 11 hours ago )\nPrices are fluctuating.

A note of warning", "text": "Even the street entertainers in London are now accepting bitcoin – but cryptocurrency, like blockchain, can be a frightening concept. At yesterday’s Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) meeting in Atlanta, an accountant from Acuity brought things back to basics, asking: should your company be using cryptocurrencies for payment?\nCryptocurrency exchanges are able to replace SWIFT payment transfer in the banking system, and there are already several accounting tools companies can usefor this.\nBut Matthew May, founder and COO of Acuity, a financial services and book-keeping company, said there were other factors to look out for when considering offering or receiving payments in cryptocurrency.\nThe first is perhaps the most obvious: volatility. In a four-month period, bitcoin values have ranged between $20,000 and $6,500. How can accounts departments manage a large range in value, and one which can change so rapidly?\nMr May said: “Our company accepts cryptocurrencies as payment, but we add a premium; and I think that’s how companies will deal with it in the short term. We are accountants, not speculators.”\nAnother factor: “skyrocketing fees”. Bitcoin now charges $28 per transaction, significantly reducing its attractiveness for small payments. (So before you consider throwing the bitcoin equivalent of a pocketful of change at a street musician, consider transaction fees.)\nOther companies, such as Dash, an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, and Ripple, a cryptocurrency limited to crypto-to-crypto exchanges, are trying to build better platforms for transaction fees. But Mr May warned that companies must constantly check the transaction fee environment in cryptocurrencies.\nAnd among the more frightening of the challenges of using cryptocurrency is the counterparty risk.\n“There is no recourse, no regulation, no rules,” he said. “If they are not your keys, they are not your coins.”\nEssentially, when cryptocurrencies are in the hands of exchanges such as Bittrex, Binance or Shapeshift for transactions or currency exchange, they hold the “keys” to your money. If they go bankrupt, or choose not to uphold their end of the bargain, there is no recourse to get the money back – no insurance, no ‘bank’ guarantees.\nMr May warned: “If you are holding cryptocurrencies, you should do so on a private network. You only use exchanges for their express purpose, and then put the money back in your company’s treasury.”\nThis lack of recourse extends to regulation in general, which Mr May said was also something of a minefield.\nThe US regulatory environment has four relevant authorities – all of which treat cryptocurrencies in different ways.

And all those who thought their bitcoin was invisible to the IRS are getting a rude awakening these days.Bitcoin was the classic bubble. Market bubbles are nothing new. In the 17th and 18th centuries we had the Dutch tulip bubble, the French Mississippi bubble and the U.K.’s South Sea bubble.The 19th century saw bubbles in canal building (1830s), gold (1869) and railroads (1890s). In the 20th and 21st centuries we have seen bubbles in Florida real estate (mid-1920s), stocks (late 1920s), dot-coms (2000) and mortgages (2007).All of these episodes of investment mania crashed, causing enormous losses for investors. As always, some investors got in early and got out before the crash and walked away with their winnings. But most did not.Analysts should remind themselves that those bubble winnings of the lucky few represent not wealth creation or rewards for hard work, but a simple wealth transfer from a mass of latecomer losers to a lucky few winners.That’s hardly a desirable model for finance in particular or society as a whole, not least because the end result destroys confidence in markets and retards normal financial functions for a full generation.The latest bubble, of course, is bitcoin. Last December as bitcoin was making its way higher from $8,000, I said that bitcoin might go to $20,000 (it did), but that it would surely come crashing down sooner rather than later.I based this forecast on a Nasdaq chart showing the dot-com bubble of 1996–2000. The hyperbolic rise in the price of bitcoin and dot-com stocks was a close fit, which made the subsequent crash easy to see coming.Now that bitcoin has crashed more about 70% based on recent lows, the resemblance to the Nasdaq dot-com episode is even more dramatic.The biggest difference is that the bitcoin rise and fall happened 15 times faster than the Nasdaq collapse. A projection of bitcoin at $2,000 is easily justified.My own projection is much lower, but either way economic historians will look back on the bitcoin episode as the greatest bubble since the Dutch tulip bubble, maybe greater.At least with the tulip bubble, the last investors got to keep the tulips. With bitcoin, investors will end up with nothing.Goldman briefly flirted with cryptocurrencies but eventually came around to the view that cryptos like bitcoin suffer from too many problems.All of the cryptocurrencies that rely on clunky “proof of work” to validate their blockchains, such as bitcoin, are heading for the scrap heap. They are too slow, too cumbersome and too expensive to compete with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal in the payments space.The only use case for bitcoin is to support criminal transactions, and even criminals have moved to some other cryptos because they have better security and privacy features. Bitcoin also suffers from slow processing times and other inefficiencies.Goldman’s assessment is mostly right. However, some coins will survive. And as I’ve argued before, blockchain technology has a bright future.Goldman also admits that blockchain technology has a future, but caution is indicated because processing speeds are still not as fast as existing systems. The bottom line is don’t invest in cryptocoins but invest in blockchain technology instead.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

bearish.\nNotably, the five-month moving average (MA) has rolled over in favor of the bears and looks set to cut the 10-month MA from above â a bearish crossover that hasn't been seen since June 2014.\nIf that occurs it could be a worrying signal for the long-term price outlook. Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015.\nGMO Launches Mobile App That Lets Gamers Earn Bitcoin\nThis time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark.\nMonthly chart Currently, the five-month MA is seen at $8,916 and the 10-month MA is located at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. Meanwhile, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 â down almost 5 percent in the last 24 hours.\nDaily chart This Long-Term Indicator Could Complicate Bitcoin's Price Recovery\nThe observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked by circles) and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs indicate a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs.\nFurther, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough room for a sell-off towards $7,000.\nWeekly chart Acceptance below the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,620, would only bolster the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the odds of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover.\nThe 50-week MA worked as a strong support in April, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off.\nView BTC risks deeper pullback towards $7,000. In such a case, the 5-month MA will cross the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover and opening doors for a drop to $5,000. Bullish scenario : A solid rebound from the 50-week MA at $7,620 and a convincing break above $8,644 would signal a bullish reversal. Down arrow Going Up?

What is Bitcoin Pizza Day? On May 22nd of 2010, a computer programmer made the first recorded real-life bitcoin purchase – two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. Today, that 10,000 BTC is worth over $80 Million dollars. A year ago, it was worth $25 Million.\nWe gathered at Little Zoe’s Take and Bake and ordered several pizzas. However instead of paying with BTC, as we did last year, this time we paid with DASH. Why DASH? Last year during the dramatic spike in fees on the Bitcoin Core network, several local businesses began accepting DASH as an alternative to BTC, to give their customers a choice.\nIn order to spend cryptocurrency, it’s the buyer who pays the network fee for processing the transaction (this is the opposite of the credit card system, where the merchant takes the fee out of their profit). Given that today fees to send BTC are typically about $0.40 and to send DASH about $0.01, it’s a no-brainer. No one would choose to spend BTC when a better option is available.\nThat better option is DASH , aka “Digital Cash”, a cryptocurrency that confirms four times faster than BTC and has really taken off at retail locations across southern New Hampshire. It proliferated because NH-based crypto point-of-sale merchant processor Anypay introduced DASH first with its release of their POS software in 2017. In fact, in an interview with Albert, the operator of DiscoverDash.com , a website that shows the physical locations of DASH-accepting businesses across the world, he told me that Keene is number three in the world for real-life DASH acceptance, behind Caracas, Venezuela at number one and Portsmouth, NH at number two!\nSo, happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price dropped by around 4 percent from $8,300 to $7,850. Bitcoin Price Trend As CCN previously reported , the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to three major factors: Mt. Gox sell-off in early May, Bitfinex taxation policy, and scandal involving South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb. These three factors led investors to lose confidence and trust in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. By targeting a small portion of their user base to forfeit tax IDs and personal identification, Bitfinex led large-scale investors to become fearful of a potential government intervention and withdrew big sums of funds from the exchange. In South Korea, due to the controversy surrounding UPbit and Bithumb, local investors have become bewildered, not knowing whether the local cryptocurrency market can be trusted or not. Despite the drastic improvement in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency industry and the entrance of major financial institutions, the overly strong downtrend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies have disallowed the market to rebound and initiate a corrective rally. It is likely that in the short-term, the BTC price drops to the lower end of $7,000, as cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo suggested on May 22. “Pretty sure $8,000 support on BTCUSD is gonna fail. Next support, low $7,000s (though that could fail too). Then I’m expecting another dead kitten taking us into July – September period when BTC unwinds completely from mania phase and is ready for an accumulation phase,” said Woo. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin has already started to show oversold conditions, which would normally result in a strong rebound for BTC. But, due to the strong downtrend of the bitcoin price, the low RSI of bitcoin will likely be dismissed and bears will continue to push the price to the lower end of $7,000. Bitcoin has successfully minimized its downtrend at the $7,700 mark, recording a slight bounce back to $7,850. However, if the bitcoin price declines below $7,700, it is likely that the bitcoin price stabilizes in the $7,300 region in the short-term. Tokens In the cryptocurrency market, trading tokens is similar to leverage trading, because tokens often increase or decline in value by larger margins in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies. Ontology, Aelf, ICON, 0x, Decentraland, Ziliqa, and AirSwap, all of which have recorded over 20 percent gains against bitcoin over the past week, have recorded losses in the range of 4 to 12 percent against bitcoin and 8 to 16 percent against the US dollar. If the BTC price fails to rebound to the $8,000 region and remains in the lower end of $7,000 throughout this week, it is highly likely that tokens will continue to drop against both bitcoin and US dollar. https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rewinds-to-7800-as-cryptocurrency-market-drops-27-billion-overnight/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bithumb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:59:21.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "728af75073c1790aaa1b97997703cfb664c5c9fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWYYp9mkozImFeGDhbLHH_c-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin can change economic?", "title_full": "Bitcoin can change economic?", "published": "2018-05-23T16:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "728af75073c1790aaa1b97997703cfb664c5c9fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWYYp9mkozImFeGDhbLHH_c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "andriw", "published": "2018-05-23T16:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can change economic?", "text": "one of the things about the effects of bitcoin on the economy is that people can buy product goods and services with cryptocurrency,\nand the impact of bitcoin in the future is the possibility of adopting its bitcoin in most of the world's nations because of its existence which began to be count in the world economy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:26:20.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbc49c99669df12b659460e4957745e85ef0d073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sR1bvh7GupbPglZPmCiL_QcPawShLpXktxbzp1WxNHobQH9Cm_pA9uQ_ojLGzhnSNgZOsL_0_PN9qXG1ICgQYhNrJzzZTf2V1eJ8WG1nt8S8KgGna4TFHP47kLzTit.0-", "site_full": "www.newser.com", "site": "newser.com", "site_section": "http://rss.newser.com/rss/section/1.rss", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "media", "photography", "hobbies_and_interests", "apartments"], "section_title": "Newser", "title": "Bitcoin Used in 2010 to Buy 2 Pizzas Now Worth $82M", "title_full": "Bitcoin Used in 2010 to Buy 2 Pizzas Now Worth $82M", "published": "2018-05-23T16:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img2-azcdn.newser.com/image/1181375-12-20180523091036.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6043, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbc49c99669df12b659460e4957745e85ef0d073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sR1bvh7GupbPglZPmCiL_QcPawShLpXktxbzp1WxNHobQH9Cm_pA9uQ_ojLGzhnSNgZOsL_0_PN9qXG1ICgQYhNrJzzZTf2V1eJ8WG1nt8S8KgGna4TFHP47kLzTit.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jenn Gidman", "published": "2018-05-23T16:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Used in 2010 to Buy 2 Pizzas Now Worth $82M", "text": "Bitcoin Used in 2010 to Buy 2 Pizzas Now Worth $82M The cryptocurrency has gone up in price just a bit since then By Jenn Gidman , Newser Staff Posted May 23, 2018 8:56 AM CDT 36 comments Comments You could buy 6.5 million pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins today.

Tuesday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, or what Business Insider calls \"the most celebrated day in crypto,\" marking the eighth anniversary of when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made what's thought to be the very first purchase with bitcoin. That purchase, per Quartz : two large pizzas from Papa John's for 10,000 bitcoins, an amount worth about $30 back then. Hanyecz sent his hoarded cryptocurrency to a fellow \"bitcoiner,\" who then placed the order. The price of bitcoin has spiked just a tad since then. If Hanyecz had kept those 10,000 bitcoins, they'd be worth $82 million or so—an amount Bloomberg has figured out would buy about 6.5 million pizzas. \"If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many bitcoins today, they'd rise to outer space,\" it notes. If you're going by the slice for those original two pizzas, each portion would be worth about $5 million today.

It’s early to speak about it but the break through this zone will indicate the intention of the market to move lower to $7100-$7000. Shortly before the start of US trading session, the digital currency is trading at levels of $7877.\nOver the past 24 hours, capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency market has decreased by 21 billion dollars to a level of 348 billion - the minimum value for the last two weeks.\nAs we noted earlier, the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market can be connected with three main factors: large-scale sales of MT Gox in early May, Bitfinex taxation policy and scandal involving the two largest exchanges UPbit and Bithumb.\nThese factors forced investors to lose confidence in the cryptocurrency market in the short term.\nProbably, in the short term, the BTC price will drop to a lower level at $7000. The relative strength index (RSI) of Bitcoin has already begun to show overselling conditions, which usually leads to a strong rebound for BTC. But due to a strong downtrend in the market, the RSI signal is likely to be ignored, and the bears will continue to push the price to the $7000-$7100 zone. However, if the market can show a day close above $7745-$7800 this will also indicate that sellers are exhausted and further downward movement may change to consolidation at current levels.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bithumb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:49:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3980e3e4db0b08473e646f21aa3bcf0cce303100", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTQzKC7hqQp9b0J0VVr.i9Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Can ethereum replace bitcoin?", "title_full": "Can ethereum replace bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-23T16:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3980e3e4db0b08473e646f21aa3bcf0cce303100", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTQzKC7hqQp9b0J0VVr.i9Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "icemantaurus", "published": "2018-05-23T16:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can ethereum replace bitcoin?", "text": "Altcoins replacing btc?

The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, East London, also known as Masjid Ramadan, partnered with local Blockchain startup Combo Innovation to set up a Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet for the Ramadan practice of Zakat, or almsgiving. The UK’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell Lane is going against the rulings of various Islamic scholars and the Turkish government , who previously determined cryptocurrency to be “incompatible” with Islam. Interpretations are far from unanimous, however, with other sources suggesting cryptocurrency is indeed suitable for use by Muslims due to its global nature. Gurmit Singh, CEO of Combo, which provides “Islamic compliant blockchain financial solutions,” is among those adhering to this more permissive stance. “If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 percent of bitcoins – or £1.04 bln ($1.39 bln) – then £26 mln ($34.6 mln) in Zakat contributions is due,” he told the Hackney Gazette, financially-able Muslims being obliged to donate 2.5% of their wealth during Ramadan. “It’s likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency. They are potentially losing out on millions of pounds.”\nThe mosque hopes to raise around £10,000 ($13,300) for repairs to the building. So far, its Bitcoin address has received funds worth around $2000.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/dalston-mosque-becomes-first-in-the-uk-to-accept-bitcoin-and-ethereum-crypto-currency-1-5529910", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-not-suitable-for-muslims-says-turkish-government", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/uk", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://blockchain.info/address/1BKVeFPC4ma3WkWQ7BDY4NS4ecTtKeFSbW", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/fintech-startup-report-concludes-bitcoin-is-generally-permissible-under-sharia-law"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shacklewell lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurmit singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masjid ramadan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:12:35.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b9e48c5a4f668817995e90326a2d1847ece9ca0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmct_wG1GS7YpLEV6SRumSNc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Price prediction", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price prediction", "published": "2018-05-23T16:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b9e48c5a4f668817995e90326a2d1847ece9ca0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmct_wG1GS7YpLEV6SRumSNc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satwantkaur", "published": "2018-05-23T16:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price prediction", "text": "What will be Bitcoin price prediction in 2018?

Traders were pleased with the news on some progress in the trade dispute between the US and China. Yesterday, the Chinese government said that it will cut import duties on passenger cars as of July 1st to 15% from the current 25%. Besides, levies on some spare parts will be reduced to 6%. The news was certainly bullish for the US dollar. Its index rebounded to nearly 93.55. However, market participants are in the wait and see mode amid expectations for the minutes of the latest policy meeting of the Federal Reserve. On Tuesday, the US dollar gained ground against its Canadian counterpart. The USD/CAD pair breached 1.2780. Earlier, the Canadian currency fell in value as a result of speculations that the US could insist on tougher trade relations. Meanwhile, the macroeconomic background in Canada provided its national currency with support. According to the official data, wholesale sales rose 1.1% in March. The fresh reading surpassed expectations for a more moderate advance by 0.8%. Another bullish factor of the Canadian dollar is a steady rally of oil prices, which allows the line to show resilience to its American counterpart.

And in a perverted twist, he declares Bitcoin useless as a currency/payment system:\nSPIEGEL ONLINE: Stiftet der Bitcoin nicht auch Nutzen als alternatives Bezahlmittel?\nDe Vries: Im praktischen Leben kann man wenig damit anfangen. Die Transaktionskosten sind enorm hoch. Hätte man Ende 2017 einen 5-Dollar-Kaffee mit Bitcoin bezahlt, wären etwa 50 Dollar Kosten obendrauf gekommen. Das ist völlig ineffizient.\nWhich roughly translates to\nSPIEGEL ONLINE: Isn't Bitcoin also useful as an alternative currency/payment system?\nDe Vries: You can't use it in real life. The transaction fees are tremendously high. If I bought a 5 dollar coffee at the end of 2017, I would have had to pay a 50 dollar fee on top. This is absolutely inefficient.\nCouldn't they at least try to be more subtle? Does the strategic partner of Blockstream directly have to scream for mining regulation? Couldn't they at least put a few layers (They love layers!) in between so that the attack on Bitcoin wouldn't be so obvious?\nReally, you can't make this up:\nStrategic Partnership between Blockstream and PWC. Blockstream hinders any progression in Bitcoin and makes it useless as a currency, transaction costs explode as does the energy consumption per transaction (obviously). PWC starts a crusade against Bitcoin because it is dangerous for the climate and a single transaction consumes to much energy and also the system is useless as a currency. ...

The higher the price the less likely it would be manipulated.\nOr the distribution of supply of bitcoin? More people holding bitcoin, the harder for the whale to move the price.\nWhat do you think?\nI think the biggest factor is stability. If the transactions would be standard, and the support it gets would be stable, coupled with a more standardized price point as well. That would surely keep the volatility at bay because it will be neutralized by the stability it would be getting if all of the factors would converge. However, at the current point, it's hard to actually do that because the reality is that it may be difficult to actually have all that factors meet at one point.\nThe volatile nature of the bitcoin is the key factor in favoring the crypto currencies to this much extent and this is the only thing which is helping the bitcoin investors to make this much of money and that too in no time. the only thing which you need to take care of is that you need to be careful while dealing at time when the market value of the bitcoin is fluctuating as one wrong move can take away all your money from you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T11:44:13.061+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b05e9c287a6692214ee0d15b88ca7f348d71d746", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc8w5aWdKJP3ERSRdMyxdsw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How do people get their bitcoins?", "title_full": "How do people get their bitcoins?", "published": "2018-05-23T16:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b05e9c287a6692214ee0d15b88ca7f348d71d746", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc8w5aWdKJP3ERSRdMyxdsw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "muneeb.zain", "published": "2018-05-23T16:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "How do people get their bitcoins?", "text": "a person can get its bitcoin from the bounty or by some trusted person who transfer bitcoin in its wallet.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:11:07.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64f27d78cfdaa921bb887c29e734f782b48b1f3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZKQLiwkSSkH1bZkAHMhT2E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?", "published": "2018-05-23T16:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64f27d78cfdaa921bb887c29e734f782b48b1f3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZKQLiwkSSkH1bZkAHMhT2E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Raja_Salman", "published": "2018-05-23T16:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?", "text": "Quote: from: Raja_Salman on May 23, 2018, 08:22:44 AM indeed bitcoin mining it requires a considerable cost and a long time before doing mining thinking more and smart in making decisions in mining investment\nAnd that is the reason why it is worth it.

CNBC’s Fast Money tweet.\nWith regards to Bitcoin [BTC], Mr Neu-Ner stated that:\n“I like bitcoin a lot, but I’m going to FODL.”\nAlthough he believes that Bitcoin’s price will go up, it’s currently low and it’s a slow and stable process. He focused on the more exciting cryptocurrencies out in the market and he will put his money in something more exciting. However, he will HODL on to Bitcoin Cash. He thinks that there is a potential and since the team consists of old Bitcoin members, he prefers them.\nHe says:\n“I think there’s a lot of potential for Bitcoin Cash, I like the team, that are driving. it’s all the old bitcoin people. I love both Bitcoin Cash [BCH] and Bitcoin [BTC] equally, but if you ask me where I put my money right now, Bitcoin Cash has more potential.”\nMr. Neu-Ner also states:\n“there are more exciting cryptocurrencies out there, and if you’re going to ask me whether I’m going to put my money in bitcoin, or something more exciting, I’m going to go with something more exciting.”\nThe ICO frenzy has taken highlight in this current cryptocurrency market world, Mr. Neu-Ner believes that the institutions will go to Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] before anything which in turn leads the market to rise.\nHe says:\n“There’s this frenzy happening which is not on the markets, where hundreds of millions of dollars are going into ICOs, where’s that money coming from? It’s not coming from fiat, it’s people cashing in their bitcoin and their Ethereum, and when they cash in the markets are going to go down.”\nOn a different cryptocurrency, Ethereum [ETH], the Onchain Capital Founder says that will HODL as the community of Ethereum is big in the industry of cryptocurrency market. He is bullish on Bitcoin Cash [BCH] and Ethereum [ETH].\nMr Neu-Ner states:\n“Thousands of people, the smartest people in the room. They’ve got used cases and they’re solving their scaling issues. So I’m holding Ethereum.”\nWhen it comes to Ripple [XRP], Ran Neu-Ner is not quite certain on the token and how it works, although he states that the Ripple [XRP] company is the best he knows.\nHe concluded:\n“So as far as I know, I can’t find a use for the token, so I’m out. It’s centralized, and that defeats the whole purpose of the blockchain.”\nHe is the founder of Onchain Capital and the host of CNBC’s Africa’s ‘Crypto Trader’ show. In this interview, he discusses his views for the several top-leading cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offering [ICOs] and the outlook of the major cryptocurrencies on the trading list.",

Explainer Trained By Real BTC Guides Gets It All Wrong May 23, 2018 5 Views An AI compilation published on Youtube Tuesday that used pre-existing Bitcoin (BTC) explainers to come up with its own “basic stage training” on Bitcoin has resulted in almost complete nonsense, Mashable reports May 22.\n</p> <p></center></div> <p dir=\"ltr\">Created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/botnikstudios\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Botnik Studios</a>, which describes itself on Twitter as a “human-machine creative force,” the Youtube video is a voice over of the texts generated by an AI that used “predictive keyboard trained on dozens of Bitcoin explainers.”</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In order to introduce the viewer to the coin, the video first explains that “Bitcoin is the most valuable form of electricity.” The AI explainer then teaches the viewer exactly how Bitcoin transactions work according to its generated text:</p> <blockquote readability=\"6.6477987421384\"><p dir=\"ltr\">“Randomly pick a number between one and 30,000. Now spend that amount of money on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. This is known as hashing the code to get some of that Bitcoin.”</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">The video also touches on the topic of <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain\">blockchain</a>, which a user can gain access to by installing “exploit.bin, and it will remind you every day of your biggest nightmares.”</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Having Bitcoin &#8211; whose most popular form is the “Wild Richard” which can be used to pay for “counterfeit coffee” &#8211; is described as having advantages despite its risks:</p> <blockquote readability=\"9\"><p dir=\"ltr\">“One benefit of Bitcoin is that you can upload a version of your future self on the darknet, but it will kill your retirement account, because it is over 1,000 years old.”</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">The video ends with two warnings to all viewers, the first being that the “safest way to protect your Bitcoin wallet is simply to lose it,” and the second touching on a more personal subject:</p> <blockquote readability=\"7\"><p dir=\"ltr\">“Caution: the last time I mined a fresh Bitcoin, billionaire killer Mark February tried to patent my life.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Cointelegraph has its own series of explainers that were not created with AI, including ones on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-mining\">Bitcoin mining</a>, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-blockchain-technology-works-guide-for-beginners\">blockchain</a>, and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-wallets-explained\">crypto wallets</a>.</p> </p></div> <br /><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-based-youtube-bitcoin-explainer-trained-by-real-btc-guides-gets-it-all-wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source: CoinTelegraph</strong></a></p> </div><!-- .entry /--> <span style=\"display:none\"><a href=\"http://www.xbt.money/tag/bitcoin/\" rel=\"tag\">#Bitcoin</a> <a href=\"http://www.xbt.money/tag/btc/\" rel=\"tag\">#BTC</a></span> <span style=\"display:none\" class=\"updated\">2018-05-23</span> <div style=\"display:none\" class=\"vcard author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"><strong class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"http://www.xbt.money/author/mpatmpat-gr/\" title=\"Posts by xbt.money\" rel=\"author\">xbt.money</a></strong></div> <div class=\"share-post\"> <span class=\"share-text\">Share</span> <ul class=\"flat-social\"> <li> </li> <li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AI-Based Youtube Bitcoin Explainer Trained By Real BTC Guides Gets It All Wrong http://www.xbt.money/?p=60474 \" class=\"social-twitter\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-twitter\"></i> <span>Twitter</span></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en&url=http://www.xbt.money/?p=60474&name=AI-Based Youtube Bitcoin Explainer Trained By Real BTC Guides Gets It All Wrong\" class=\"social-google-plus\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-google-plus\"></i> <span>Google +</span></a></li> <li> </span></li> <li> </li> <li> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clear\"></div> </div> <!-- .share-post --> <div class=\"clear\"></div> </div><!-- .post-inner --> </article><!-- .post-listing --> <div class=\"e3lan e3lan-post\"> <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <!-- under post --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4667345015737995\" data-ad-slot=\"4662859865\" data-ad-format=\"auto\"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

As I expected, the price tested the level of $7.772 and met my yesterday's target. The Chilean president, Mario Marcel, has made comment seemingly in favor of developing a regulatory apparatus for virtual currencies. The apparent openness to regulating cryptocurrencies contrasts significantly from the recent banking embargo targeting virtual currency, recently witnessed in Chile. The technical picture on Bitcoin looks bearish.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that the price broke support trendline in the background. I also found a breakout of intraday bearish flag, which is another sign of weakness. The MACD oscillator is showing weakness. My advice is to watch for potential selling opportuinties. The downward targets are set at the price of $7.566 and at the price of $6.962.\nSupport/Resistance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mario marcel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T07:08:52.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "085356211980776cab539f51cd43ed32ed018ebd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhEciOm54ncQ3rKhPbwq35ko-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T16:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "085356211980776cab539f51cd43ed32ed018ebd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhEciOm54ncQ3rKhPbwq35ko-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T16:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 23, 2018 NEWS London mosque becomes first to accept cryptocurrency after bitcoin declared halal The Independent A London mosque is thought to be the first in the world to accept bitcoin donations, one month after an Islamic scholar declared the cryptocurrency ...

We have met several times (in London, Tokyo and Hong Kong) to share insights and collaborate. This announcement demonstrates how we are working together to make Bitcoin Cash widely used and trusted”, said Centbee CEO, Angus Brown and co-CEO Centbee, Lorien Gamaroff.\nWhen asked whether this partnership will actually enable customers to access Bitcoin Cash at a till-point, Brown and Gamaroff said that it is exactly their intention.\n“That is absolutely our intention, that any retailer can accept payment in Bitcoin Cash. We envisaged this being primarily a mobile phone payment- either by scanning a QR code or tapping an NFC-compatible phone on the merchant’s POS terminal”.\nPicture: In Hong Kong this week for the Coingeek.com conference are nChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen, Lorien Gamaroff, co-CEO Centbee, Dr Craig Wright, Chief Scientist nChain and Angus Brown, Centbee co-CEO. (Supplied).\nBrown and Gamaroff also said that this toolkit will make access to Bitcoin much easier. The merchant will not need to install new hardware or software. They will receive settlement in Rands in their existing bank accounts. They will also not have to worry about the exchange rate of Bitcoin Cash to Rands, said Brown and Gamaroff.\nThe toolkit is essentially a set of software modules that allows retailers to integrate their existing Point-of-Sale software and hardware to the Bitcoin Cash network.\nJust last year, Centbee piloted the acceptance of Bitcoin payments at retail points of sale. The pilot project provided a Johannesburg based merchant with a QR code and made a payment by scanning the QR code from the Centbee app on a mobile phone. “The merchant received Bitcoin immediately, and chose to hold the Bitcoin and not convert to Rands”, said Brown and Gamaroff.\nBusiness Report then asked Brown and Gamaroff whether Bitcoin will be stable in coming years, giving its volatility over the past few months. They said that Bitcoin has grown exponentially over the past 10 years.\n“We think that Bitcoin Cash will be viewed in due course like the foundation layers of the internet- and most of the applications that provide value to customers are still to be uncovered”.\n“We encourage everyone to do some research, and try it out.

Since 2014, the IRS has made it possible to do this by classifying cryptocurrencies as personal property for tax purposes. However comma before you start a bitcoin IRA , you need to make sure that you know what you are doing so that you don't get taken advantage of.\nHow to Start a Bitcoin IRA\nEven though the IRS has allowed cryptocurrencies for 4 years now, a lot of people continue to think that the only asset classes allowable in an IRA are things such as mutual funds and stocks. The reality is that the IRS allows all types of asset classes, prohibiting only collectibles and life insurance. Cryptocurrency is not a collectible nor is it life insurance, which means it is allowable in a retirement account.\n However, the reality is also that the fact that something isn't prohibited by the IRS does not mean it is explicitly endorsed either. This is why they are now quite a lot of companies out there that engage in deceptive marketing techniques comma stating for instance that the IRS has approved there investment offerings. This is a fraudulent and entirely false statement, as the IRS does not approve any Investments, only listing what is prohibited.\n There are three important steps to be aware of if you want to start a bitcoin IRA. Those are:\n To use the correct type of IRA. You must open a self directed IRA, meaning that you can invest in anything allowed by law. Do not accidentally open a captive IRA, which means that you can invest solely in the assets offered by the IRA company. It is up to you to decide whether you are interested in a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. To open a bitcoin wallet . Once you have put money into your self directed IRA, you will need to have a crypto wallet as well. This is almost like a safety deposit box in which all the necessary information is held enabling you to purchase, sell, and use cryptocurrency. There are many vendors that offer wallets, and you should consider there degrees of security in particular. Sometimes, the IRA custodian will only agree to offer you cryptocurrency IRA Solutions if you are registered as an LLC, and that the IRA is the owner of the LLC. If this is what you have done, then it is important that your digital wallet is named after the LLC. You must fund your bitcoin wallet using funds only from your IRA. You cannot use IRA funds as well as other capital sources. This is unambiguously prohibited, in fact. The tax problems you would get if you were to ignore this rule are cataclysmic. The reason for this is the exclusive benefit your received by having an IRA in first place.

How Bitcoin ATM works? May 23, 2018\nThe bitcoin ATM looks like a normal one, but it doesn’t work the same. Unlike with ATM for fiat currency, where users can make cash deposits or withdrawals. Bitcoin ATM only enables users to buy and sell Bitcoins for fiat cash. Though some of these ATMs do not allow withdrawal option for bitcoin, as it’s not a physical currency, and only accepts cash i.e. buy bitcoins on them.\nUsing the Bitcoin ATM can be more expensive than the online transactions, this is because of the high cost of infrastructure associated with Bitcoin ATM, that is erecting the actual ATM and the required procedures to actually transfer the money and Bitcoins.\nThe first step involved in using a Bitcoin ATM is to first scan one’s identification which will then be validated by the ATM. To buy bitcoin, the user generates a QR code (a large square of black and white pixels) for his/her wallet address from his/her wallet. The user inserts some cash into the ATM, the cash is immediately converted to Bitcoin equivalent which the user can then sends to his/her wallet via the address presented in the QR code. In case of a withdrawal, some Bitcoin ATMs generate a paper wallet, others generate an offline wallet, basically an instrument bearing the Bitcoins.\nSince Bitcoin ATMs are basically money transmitting tools, they come under FinCEN rulings and have to comply with Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Registering for such money transmitter status can be expensive, this means Bitcoin ATM providers have to pay up high fees.\nUsually, these fees are about 5 percent, while quoted fees are taken from large exchanges on a live basis. The ATM provider will endeavor to manage its Bitcoin and cash exposure by balancing its inputs and outputs through live trading with its exchange because holding a lot of Bitcoin without hedging can possibly result in large profits or losses. Another problem comes with banking facilities. Getting traditional banking facilities have been extremely difficult for bitcoin-related businesses, hence, moving cash in and out can be challenging. However, hedging using various Bitcoin futures is a method of alleviating the risks posed by Bitcoin’s volatile price fluctuations.\nOne important use of the ATM is for travelers when they are faced with high fees at traditional bureau de changes, so buying bitcoin before the journey and selling it afterward, though with 5 percent fees each way and large volatility this is quite risky. Another potential use of the ATM is that it allows the unbanked to gain access to Bitcoin and partake in international e-commerce. Basically, this gives these people the chance to become their own global bank as Bitcoin spreads all over the corners of the world.\nThe post How Bitcoin ATM works? appeared first on Cryptomartez .

Crypto markets are seeing significant losses across the board, with all top ten coins by market cap in the red, as Coin360 data shows. Market visualization by Coin360\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading around $7,846 as of press time, down more than 4 percent over the 24 hour period. Trading volume for BTC has hovered between 5 and 6 bln for the past week, significantly down from volumes earlier this month. Bitcoin price chart.

The dip brings the altcoin’s monthly value change into the negative, threatening to reverse what had been astonishing monthly gains of over 100 percent in early May. Ethereum price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Ethereum Price Index\nOther major altcoins - including Cardano , IOTA , TRON , and EOS - are all seeing 24 hour period losses of between 8 and 11 percent, as data from Coinmarketcap shows.\nHaving rallied as high as $1800 in early May , Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) has failed to sustain higher valuations, falling almost 9 percent in the 24 hour period and trading around $1039 to press time. The dip comes despite last week’s upgrade to increase BCH’s block size from 8MB to 32MB and reactivate formerly disabled Op codes , suggesting the coin’s performance is mirroring a broader market decline. Bitcoin Cash price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Bitcoin Cash Price Index\nThe markets’ negative performance suggest that despite increasing provisions to facilitate mainstream investment in the crypto space, notably with a recent trend to provide custodian solutions for institutional holders, more robust regulatory guidelines and clarity are still needed for traditional financial sector capital to come in.\nAt the beginning of this week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced it plans to provide tighter guidance for the crypto market. Futures on CBOE and CME are both in the red this morning, May 23, with CBOE’s June contract XBTM8 down 3.79 percent to $7,865.00, and CME’s May contract BTCK8 down 4.10 percent at $7,845.00.\nIn Asia meanwhile, a new report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, reiterated the Chinese government’s concerns about “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraud, with a new government-led study detecting 421 fake cryptocurrencies in China’s crypto space. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

BMV statements read:\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries. The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries”.\nThe principal shareholder of Masventas, Jose Humberto Dakak, explains that, the approach proposes to fortify the bank’s smartphone and digital based services. He adds it will also helps to reduce the service costs of bank. He said,\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad”.\nUnder the provision of new approach, BMV customers are allowed to send money to 50 different countries. Thus, helps to cut off the transfer times up to 24 hours. Due to security issues and letdowns, BMV moves away from Swift, clearing network used by many banks.\nFurther, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitex’s, Manuel Beaudroit, this approach marked the first time in the world that the bank using bitcoin for cross-border payments . He Beaudroit;\n“The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider. For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin”.\nAt the end, if BMV and Bitex payments approach succeeds then Argentina will greatly achieve heights in crypto adoption.
