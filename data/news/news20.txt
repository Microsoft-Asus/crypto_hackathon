June 7, 2018 “Bitcoin is becoming the new VIX,” said Brian Stutland, President of Equity Armor Investments on CNBC’s Options Action segment as the markets were taking a tumble last week. His evidence? The very short 6-month window showing the correlation between the VIX Index and Bitcoin, as well as the assumption that investors that are pulling their money out of the market and putting it into Bitcoin:\n“If you want to know what the market is going in the next 30 days, look at what bitcoin did 30 days ago. When we overlay the two together, there is huge correlation between VIX and Bitcoin 30 days ago.\nBitcoin is a way for investors to move money off the balance sheet of banks and into their own wallet. Essentially, they are storing them money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency. You’re worried banks are going to have some sort of credit risk. As credit risk increase, we get more volatility.” Is it that investors are actually taking money out of the market (pushing stocks down and VIX up) and into Bitcoin (pushing Bitcoin up), or is it that Bitcoin has marketed itself as the antithesis of markets and every chink in the armor of the establishment (markets) is a feather in the cap for the anti-establishment (Bitcoin)? Or is it that the blue squiggly line just happens to overlap the red squiggly line (with a 30-day lag) in a purely coincidental curiosity? We’ll take the latter. Just consider the following MarketWatch chart from this Josh Brown blog post showing the high correlation between the Dow “now” and before the great market crash of 1929. READ Tim \"Drake\" Draper - The Bitcoin [BTC] hustler Scary indeed… but now look back at the fine print on the X-axis. That’s the 2012-2014 period… not now. Updating that chart with current data would show we’re up several trillions of dollars in market cap, or about 73%, since then. Jeff Bezos himself has made more money since the end of that chart than probably 90% of all of humanity has made in the entirety of the world before that time. So, color us a bit skeptical that Bitcoin and VIX lining up for a short stint mean anything significant.

He waxed lyrical about the subject, noting that there’s a huge transformative potential in the technology that everyone should have some sort of exposure to it.\n“Start small, as I always say, educate yourself, get used to the tech and, once you’re familiar, if you still think this thing has legs, increase your exposure,” he wrote.\nFrisby then went on to the story of Bitcoin, along with the much-touted Satoshi Nakamoto invention and that famous quote: “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”\nHe said that it’s important to distinguish between cash and money and that in the physical world, cash is being used far less than before, noting that the recent breakdown of the VISA network is an important development that made the dangers of relying on third parties all too apparent.\nOn the birth of Bitcoin Cash, Frisby outlined the fact that Bitcoin developers had felt that the original currency had strayed too much from its original goal and that transaction times were too expensive as well as too slow for certain payments.\nAccording to Frisby, “Bitcoin (BTC) has morphed into a speculative asset, more like digital gold than cash.” He pointed out that gold was once the backbone of the global monetary system, but its use in payments has been limited.\n“People preferred to hoard gold and pay with copper, nickel, silver or paper. Bitcoin’s role in the crypto eco-structure is similar,” Frisby wrote.\nThis is not entirely correct since if something has to be a store of value, it has to have a purpose and, at present, there is no purpose to BTC since carrying out transactions with it remains prohibitively expensive as well as very slow.\nBitcoin Cash , according to Frisby, has proved to be far better for payments given its quick processing time as well as its low transaction fees. Interestingly, Frisby also revealed that there have been efforts to get the Edinburgh Festival, the third largest event after the World Cup and the Olympic Games, to support Bitcoin Cash as a means of payment for its ticketing services.\n“I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want Bitcoin Cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used,” Frisby noted.\nHe also said that Bitcoin Cash is more likely to go up ten times from its current prices than BTC will. That means that it could hit $10,000 by the end of the year which would be quite an incredible boom for investors. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

Chanos believes that as bull markets in the crypto industry keep advancing, there will be a rise in the number of questionable blockchain and crypto companies. Food Would Be Better Than Bitcoin In Worst-Case Scenario\nChanos is most famous for having predicted the fall of American energy giant Enron Corporation before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. When asked to share his thoughts on cryptos, Chanos minced no words as he tore into cryptos, terming them a libertarian fantasy. While he has no doubt that the fiat currencies which Bitcoin seeks to replace could one day bring the world to its knees, Bitcoin is still the last thing he’d want to own if the grid went down.\nAnd what is Bitcoin good for?\nBitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\nCrypto enthusiasts hail the blockchain and cryptos as revolutionary, yet these proponents still turn to old technology, Chanos claims. Giving an example of an early crypto enthusiast who made money from crypto trading in 2017 but was still using a fax machine to cash in on his earnings, Chanos reiterated his belief that cryptos were nothing but a security speculation which is touted as a technological breakthrough that will transform the current monetary system.\nSomeone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a “monetary Somalia.”\nThe crypto craze of the past year fits the classic fraud cycle, the man who also teaches a course on financial fraud at Yale University stated. In the cycle, people’s caution and skepticism gradually fade away as the financial markets improve, and they begin to invest in projects they ordinarily wouldn’t have. This makes it easier for fraudsters to carry out their activities. Once the financial cycle dies down, those fraudsters become easy to spot.\nChanos also believes that cryptos would work the least in a worst-case scenario, contrary to many people’s belief. Many crypto enthusiasts believe that a fiat apocalypse is on its way and that cryptos will save the day, but they would not – especially not as a store of value.\nFood would work the best!\nChanos echoed the sentiments of fellow economist and renowned crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini. Roubini has vocally expressed his skepticism on as many platforms as have been available to him. A favorite at many financial industry discussion panels, he has referred to cryptos as the biggest bubble in human history and a “colossal pump and dump scheme.” Roubini has also called out crypto projects, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, for claiming that they are decentralized while the mining of these digital assets is controlled by big companies that can afford expensive mining equipment.

This signals that bulls continue to defend the bottom and that the uptrend could stay intact. Technical indicators, however, show mixed signals as the moving averages are bullish while oscillators suggest another drop.\nBitcoin price has resumed its climb after another dip to the bottom of its short-term channel, indicating that bulls are not letting up.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the upside or that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. These moving averages are also close to the bottom of the channel to add to its strength as support.\nHowever, RSI is starting to turn lower to signal a return in bearish pressure. Stochastic is moving up but in the overbought region to reflect slowing bullish momentum and a potential drop back to support.\nIf bulls continue to stay in the game, bitcoin price could resume the climb to the top of the channel near the $8,000 mark. An upside break could lead to a steeper climb while resistance holding could spur another pullback to the bottom around $7,700. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price suffered another dip in recent sessions but pulled up for a strong bounce when the SEC announced that it is not changing the securities rule to accommodate ICOs. It did not mention anything negative on bitcoin, however, as it cited:\nCryptocurrencies: These are replacements for sovereign currencies, replace the dollar, the euro, the yen with bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security.”\nMany read this to mean that the group will not be regulating bitcoin in the near future or have those entities registered under their jurisdiction.

The largest cryptocurrency by market cap appears to have settled in the mid to high $7,000 levels of late, but there is some talk of a push towards the $8,000 level in the near future. Bitcoin Cash maintained its level of around $1,150 at press time on Thursday with very little movement either way, although that there might be a considerable push forward in the coming days as the currency has consolidated well at this level.Ethereum also maintained the $610 level after having briefly dropped below $600 in a small retracement on Wednesday afternoon. Ripple has consolidated around the $0.67 level with a possibility of moving towards the $0.70 mark very soon. EOS continued to be rather volatile post main net and was trading at around $13.70 at press time, with a spike above the $14 level at one point.Dash was basically static at the $315 mark, whilst Ethereum Classic did not see much movement either and traded at the $15 level for most of the past 24 hours.

Without an official public announcement, enthusiasts have precious few concrete details on which to hang hope. However, combine the retail legacy asset management company’s long time bullish attitude on bitcoin with what has been revealed this week through internal documents, and the spectre of a whale entering the ecosystem appears to be promising.\nAlso read: Bitcoin ETF: Firms Team, Reapply, $200,000 Price Targets Wall Street Institutions Fidelity Flexes Muscles in Possible Crypto Exchange Move\nWithin the corporate world, if there is hesitation on a rollout, or a new product is particularly innovative, novel, trial balloons are floated in circuitous ways, and often to the financial press. Leak the idea to a well read reporter, and watch the broader reaction and reception.\nThe above planted, note how Business Insider (paywall) let loose juicy tidbits this week regarding an assumed move of Fidelity Investments into the cryptocurrency exchange space. Over two trillion dollars of muscle with closing-in on finishing its 8th decade of operations, it doesn’t come much more whale, much more legacy than Fidelity. Considering too the broader community’s Crypto Winter extending into Spring and not much more happening as it enters Summer, with huge price drops and stubborn lack of real recovery, news of this sort is very much coveted.\nCrypto beat reporter, Frank Chaparro, reveals Fidelity internal documents point to the giant financial institution being on the hunt to fill a newly created development operations engineering position, helping to “engineer, create, and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud.” There’s also rumor the firm has been mulling such a move for the better part of a year. Documents also mention positions offering “first-in-class custodian services for Bitcoin and other digital currencies.” Ecosystem press has run wild with speculation on these tasty morsels.\nFidelity CEO Abigail Johnson, 56, caused a stir after assuming the formal helm of its 45,000 employees last Spring. In one of her first public addresses, she openly praised bitcoin. A billionaire many times over in her own right, Ms. Johnson declared, “I love this stuff,” while sporting a Vote Nakamoto President pin. Fidelity Has History of Supporting Crypto\nShe went on last year to explain the company has Fidelity Labs largely dedicated to the tech, working with universities such as its hometown MIT Digital Currency Initiative. “Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities. It will fundamentally change market structures, and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself,” Ms. Johnson urged. “I am still a believer. It’s no accident that I’m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services firm that hasn’t given up on digital currencies,” she reminded at the time.\nFidelity presently has an arrangement with crypto bank Coinbase, which allows links between users’ two accounts respectively. The reported move in creating an exchange, if implemented, would immediately place Fidelity against Coinbase. It would also signal to the broader retail investment community how cryptocurrency will be a standard part of the speculative economy, and soon. Abigail Johnson\nOn many levels, crypto has sought a kind of mainstreaming for its assets. Fidelity brings that immediately on the first day it establishes an exchange, assuming rumors are true. Coinbase, not to be outdone, has recently announced its overt effort to embrace formal regulation and registration, something Fidelity has long held of course. Susquehanna International Group is also mulling a bitcoin futures move. Goldman Sachs is often linked to crypto desks being contemplated.\nAs to whether all this at Fidelity’s end is just a trial balloon, Barron’s quotes a company spokeswoman as responding, “It’s no secret that we are actively exploring cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and other digital assets in our Blockchain Incubator at Fidelity. We see the future of financial services taking place on open and permissionless ledgers, with technologies like digital assets, currencies and Blockchains and we are very actively exploring what this may mean for Fidelity. We are hiring to meet the demand for this exploration, but we have nothing to announce today.”\nWill Fidelity open a crypto exchange? Let us know in the comments.\nImages via the Pixabay, Fidelity.\nVerify and track bitcoin cash transactions on our BCH Block Explorer , the best of its kind anywhere in the world.

What are the next targets?\nThe Technical Confluence Indicator shows that the initial resistance awaits at the $ 7,750 level which is the convergence of the 1h-high, the 4h-high, the Fibonacci 23.6 percent one-month, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, and the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 1.\nNext up, the $ 7,965 number defends the round $8,000 level. It is the meeting point of the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 3 and the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 2.\nYet the most prominent target is at $ 8,181 which is the confluence of the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-month, a powerful line, and the Simple Moving Average 200-4h. Evsen higher, $ 8,301 , $ 8,396 , and $ 8,458 .\nOn the downside, strong support awaits at $ 7,627 which is the congestion of the Simple Moving Average 100-1h, the one-week high, the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-day, and the SMA 5-1d. Further down, the $ 7,412 price level is the convergence of the Bolinger Band 1h-Lower, the Fibonacci 38.2 percent one-week, and the Pivot Point one-day Support 2.\nHere is how it looks on the tool:\nThe Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels , Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\nThis tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.\nLearn more about Technical Confluence\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-top-price-prediction-upside-targets-after-the-coinbase-sec-news-boost-confluence-detector-201806071000", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators#howtouseit", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin", "https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/pivot-points", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/crypto-market-cheers-coinbase-move-to-obtain-secs-license-bitcoin-ethereum-and-ripple-recovering-from-wednesdays-losses-201806070338", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators", "https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sec news boost", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:47:46.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a504173b3056d2def775cc2c134e793a72c2c9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwqDFJUQA0n0JLXPO2uBllg-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "bitcoin wallet", "title_full": "bitcoin wallet", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a504173b3056d2def775cc2c134e793a72c2c9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwqDFJUQA0n0JLXPO2uBllg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin wallet", "text": "------------------\nSelling blockchain account with 50 bitcoins (or just private key from this wallet).\nScreen: https://gyazo.com/bd8fe40e8a82e5376cbe75c3db11965a\nEmail me with your offer nxnteam@gmx.com\n------------------", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T12:52:16.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "684c554eae00d7b7f36628d5fa7c28955178d6e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS82qmZTtDghLlSvlzE3gqk0-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

That value is based on the company’s assets and future earnings power. When you buy bitcoin, you’re betting that someday, for some reason, you’ll be able to unload your bitcoin to someone else at a higher price — assuming that it doesn’t get stolen first .\nYou could play the bitcoin “greater fool” game, and it might work out if you get lucky. But buying shares of high-quality companies is a much better strategy. Which stocks should you buy? Take a look at International Business Machines ( NYSE:IBM ) , Canopy Growth ( NYSE:CGC ) , and SolarEdge ( NASDAQ:SEDG ) . Image source: Getty Images. A blockchain company\nTim Green (International Business Machines): If you want some exposure to blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underlies bitcoin, without taking a ton of risk , IBM is your best bet. While IBM rarely leads the pack when it comes to new technologies, blockchain is an exception. The company has already worked with more than 400 clients on blockchain projects. The most notable example: A joint venture with shipping giant Maersk to build a global trade digitization platform.\nWhile IBM’s blockchain business has plenty of potential, there’s not much downside if the technology doesn’t pan out. The company has bet on cloud computing and artificial intelligence to drive its turnaround, and blockchain is more icing on the cake than anything else. IBM doesn’t need blockchain to succeed. If you buy bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, which have no intrinsic value whatsoever, all you have is downside.\nInvesting in IBM does come with some risk. The company is still working through its transformation, and revenue only began growing again at the end of 2017. The company’s cloud business is growing quickly, but its various legacy businesses are shedding sales fast enough to offset that growth. And while AI is a key component of IBM’s strategy , the company doesn’t disclose much about how much revenue its Watson AI system is generating. If IBM’s growth businesses slow down, or if they prove less profitable than what they’re replacing, the stock may remain stuck in the doldrums.\nBut IBM is a lot less risky than buying bitcoin. With the stock trading for just 10.5 times the company’s adjusted earnings guidance and sporting an 4.4% dividend yield, there’s plenty of upside if IBM can deliver. This stock made investors more money than bitcoin in the last one year\nNeha Chamaria (Canopy Growth): The anticipation of minting dizzying amounts of money easily overshadows the strong possibility of not making a safe landing, often leading many to make irrational investing decisions. Buying bitcoin is one of them, as the insane level of volatility and other risks associated with the cryptocurrency make it nothing short of a speculative investment, at least for now.\nInstead, how about looking at stocks that give you bitcoin-like thrill but are still proven businesses with big growth potential if things fall into place? Marijuana stock Canopy Growth is what I have in mind right now.\nYou see, Canada-based Canopy Growth is already the largest pot stock in the world today, so you’d have actually made more money in Canopy shares than bitcoin in the past one year. Of course, Canopy Growth’s valuation now feels like bitcoin at its peak, but there’s a difference. While bitcoin had no visible catalyst to run higher, recreational cannabis could be on its way to legalization in Canada after medical marijuana that’s already legal in the nation for several years now. If that happens, it would open the doors to a huge market for Canopy, which already has a solid foothold in the pot industry, massive production capacity, and a distribution channel and partnerships that have been the envy of other producers.\nLet me warn you: I still believe Canopy is an expensive and risky bet at current prices, but if bitcoin is luring you today, Canopy is an equally thrilling yet a relatively lower-risk substitute simply because the marijuana business is still real, unlike cryptocurrency. You don’t need to buy a cryptocurrency to earn huge profits\nRich Smith (SolarEdge): What stock is a better buy than bitcoin? If you ask me, almost any stock is — inasmuch as a stock represents a percentage ownership in a business, a business has the potential to grow over time, and that growth has the potential to produce more profits every year from now to infinity.\nA bitcoin… doesn’t. It’s just a piece of notional currency that may or may not have scarcity value, depending on whether it proves useful in the future or is abandoned as useless. Granted, bitcoin does appeal to some investors because its notional value can grow rapidly — but then again, so can the value of stocks, including my pick today: SolarEdge.\nFor example, bitcoin has risen roughly 220% in price over the past year, but SolarEdge stock is up 254%. It’s literally been a better investment than bitcoin already.\nAs you may or may not know, SolarEdge makes solar inverters — the electronic widgets that transform direct current energy collected from solar panels into alternating current electricity that can turn on the lights at your home. It’s a valuable business that generates substantial profits — $106 million in GAAP earnings over the past 12 months alone and an even more impressive $144 million in free cash flow.\nSolarEdge is also a growing business. As solar power gains broader acceptance around the globe, analysts believe SolarEdge’s profits will grow 22% annually on average over the next five years. Ordinarily, I’d ballpark a stock with these characteristics at roughly $3.2 billion in value. But today, SolarEdge stock costs less than $2.8 billion — $2.5 billion ex-cash.\nAt better than a 20% discount to intrinsic value, I think SolarEdge is a much better investment than bitcoin.\nNeha Chamaria has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Proposes New Protocols to Decentralize Bitcoin Mining\nPublished 8 hours ago Bitcoin Mining BetterHash bitcoin core Matt Corallo Stratum News Bitcoin Technology\nThe New Yorker via newyorker.com Published by Corallo — perhaps better known by his social media handle TheBlueMatt — on his personal GitHub repository this week, the “BetterHash Mining Protocol(s)” seeks to address one of the many “pressures” in bitcoin mining that push the ecosystem toward centralization: Stratum, the most widely-used mining protocol. As Corallo explains, deficiencies in the design of Stratum, combined with the fact that most bitcoin miners point their hashpower toward mining pools, limit the diversity of block templates used across the network. Corallo seeks to replace the Stratum protocol with a new system that divides block construction and payouts into two protocols — Work and Pool — collectively known as BetterHash.This will allow individual miners to select the transactions they include in blocks, rather than letting mining pool operators make that choice for them, while still benefiting from the stable payouts that connecting to a pool provides. At present, miners who want to use their own block templates must either solo mine or connect to small decentralized mining pool p2pool, which increases their autonomy at the cost of being unable to receive stable payouts. Under BetterHash, pool operators would not be able to use their position to tell miners whether to adopt particular network upgrades.Moreover, giving miners more control over block templates also helps mitigate the risk of a government ordering a locally-operated mining pool to censor particular types of transactions. Notably, BetterHash does not force miners to construct their own block templates if they do not want to, but it does give them the option to utilize the Work protocol to connect to another pool’s block template — even if they want to direct their hashpower somewhere else. In addition to decreasing centralization within the bitcoin mining ecosystem, BetterHash also introduces some performance improvements over Stratum.

Cindicator’s Hybrid Intelligence combines collective forecasts from over 105,000+ analysts, 5,000+ traders and AI. Over a period of eight weeks, an experiment was conducted where 45 traders executed 1,170 trades based on Cindicator’s Hybrid Intelligence Indicators. On average, the traders generated a return of 21.53% in BTC or 21.54% in USD in eight weeks. The traders outperformed the HOLD 10 Private Index Fund, the common crypto benchmark, which was up 12.97% in USD over the same period. Together, the 45 traders achieved a cumulative return of 16.26% over the period, or a 166% annualised return in Bitcoin, i.e. 2.66x. Within six months of the launch of Cindicator’s analytical product, the experiment validated Hybrid Intelligence as a profitable tool for trading and investing in the highly volatile crypto markets. Contest rules From 19 March until 13 May, 45 traders and investment professionals competed in a contest that invited them to test different strategies using Hybrid Intelligence indicators. The group of 45 traders was selected from over 5,000 of Cindicator’s token holders who use the analytical products on a daily basis. All traders started new accounts on the same crypto exchange. Traders were also required to record every trade in a spreadsheet and provide access to their trading accounts for results verification. Traders were invited to a private Telegram chat, where they could freely communicate with each other, discussing different approaches and strategies. They could choose any strategy as long as their trades were based on Hybrid Intelligence indicators. Cindicator’s indicators Cindicator’s indicators combine human insights from the collective mind and AI to predict the likelihood of market events. First, 105,000 independent analysts use Cindicator’s mobile app to answer questions about prices for specific assets and various financial and economic events. Over 20 machine learning models then aimed to isolate systematic biases by assigning different weightings to answers, taking into account analysts’ past performance and other data. Finally, a neural network identifies non-linear relationships between different models. The resulting indicators show the probability of different events, for example whether a specific asset will reach a certain price by a given date. Since Q1 2017, indicators have achieved an average accuracy of over 60% and it continues to improve as the neural network learns from additional data . Trading strategies As the experiment showed, indicators are flexible instruments that could be creatively applied to a range of different strategies. Some traded based on indicators with a high likelihood. “What I did first was to start with 100% ETH stack, on general principles, then trade 10% of my stack to a long position whenever any indicator was above 65%,” said one of the top 10 traders. Others preferred more nuanced indicators. “On indicators, I should avoid high percentages: they mean everybody is seeing a big green candle… I prefer seeing the potential in the future than in the past. I’m more interested by indicators between 50 and 65%, if possible with a goal above 10%.” One of the top traders, Vyom Mahadevia, decided to join the Cindicator team after the experiment, so we asked him about his strategies. “My trading strategy is based on wave theory which is loosely based on the mass psychology of traders depicted through charts. Cindicator’s indicators are a perfect compliment to this style of trading (or any style of trading actually) as you get direct access to the psychology and sentiments of market participants. You can gauge the sentiments of the entire market based on the indicators provided by them,” he said. However, the indicators could be used by themselves, without any technical analysis, Vyom explained. And indicators could also be used to find new ideas. “Their internal team of analysts does a really good job in finding the right opportunities and catching the pulse of the market,” he added. As an early supporter and token holder, Vyom was already contributing to the ecosystem, but the experiment finally tipped the scales in favour of joining the team. “Being a trader in traditional as well as cryptocurrency markets, once Cindicator’s Hybrid Intelligence came out and showed promise, my mind was racing with possibilities. I felt really invested and engaged with their vision and the project and I wanted to do more to help.” Findings show top traders made +66% in BTC in eight weeks By the end of the contest, 29 traders turned a profit, five ended with losses, and 11 didn’t trade. On average, each trader made 30 trades. The average return per single trade was 0.70%. The top trader made a return of 96.33% while the worst individual result was -39.22%. The top five traders made over 66% each. On average, traders made a total return of 21.53%. The return was measured in Bitcoin, which means that it’s isolated from fiat/crypto exchange rate fluctuations. These results were generated during a time of significant volatility but with no prevailing market trend. On 19 March, the first day of the experiment, Bitcoin was trading on Bitfinex in the range of $8,085–8,717 and on the last day, 13 May, it was trading between $8,318–8,760. Theoretically, strategies based on indicators would work in any market. On average traders generated a simplified alpha of 8.57% in USD over eight weeks. This is calculated by subtracting the 12.97% return of the HOLD 10 index from the total average return of 21.54% in USD generated by the traders. The HOLD 10 is used as benchmark since it’s a basket of the largest crypto assets, priced in USD, weighted by five-year diluted market capitalisation and rebalanced monthly. Here is how Cindicator Co-founder and CTO Yuri Lobyntsev commented: “These results are phenomenal. We already knew that our technology was delivering a high accuracy. Now our token holders have also figured out how to apply indicators in their trading to increase profits. Yet this is only the beginning — we have over 5,000 traders in our ecosystem and we’re going to make more experiments to spread the knowledge between them. The value everybody is extracting from Collective Intelligence will rise significantly when these insights are further verified, refined, codified and available for all of the contributors to the ecosystem.” Key outcomes and insights The experiment validated the value of Cindicator’s existing products and the ecosystem’s technology. It confirmed the benefits of integrating the ecosystem’s traders with the team’s internal analysts. Trading records and discussions gave valued materials for creating new, even more interesting approaches for training the entire Hybrid Intelligence to manage capital. The experiment built the foundations for a new socio-technological part of the ecosystem: traders and token holders who use hybrid indicators to manage a hybrid fund in a decentralised manner. “We see how the ecosystem gives rise to the newest form of hybrid approach to collective market analysis and decentralised capital allocation. This has enormous potential for disrupting the asset management industry in the new economy. We now plan to test indicators with a group of collective microfunds. We’ll select teams of traders and each group will jointly manage assets that we’ll allocate to them. This is a whole new paradigm in asset management where we blur the boundaries between technologists, clients, and traders,” said Yuri Lobyntsev, Cindicator Co-founder and CTO. “With this second stage of our experiment, we’re essentially modeling a new format of a decentralised investment fund that in future could successfully compete with traditional funds. In this new format, diverse individuals with different unique professional skills are united in a decentralised structure for effective asset management. Their unique intellectual skills are utilised with maximum efficiency without any centralised oversight. In the long-term, this structure could not only deliver a superior return, but could also have a decentralised model that is more resilient to various risks and changing market conditions, such as financial crises and artificial bubbles,” added Mike Brusov, Cindicator Co-founder and CEO. Experiments in traditional markets A year and a half ago the group validated a similar model for decentralised asset management. In a single “investment fund” Cindicator united diverse motivated traders and a collective mind of tens of thousands of analysts. The analysts generated data for traders’ decisions. While the Cindicator team has deep expertise in crypto markets, earlier experiments also proved that the technology could also be effectively applied to traditional assets. In early 2017, Cindicator carried out a pilot study with the Moscow Exchange during which 863 participants made forecasts for futures contracts for USD/RUB, oil, gold, and silver. It’s noteworthy that 40% of participants had no prior trading experience. Based on collective forecasts, Cindicator’s robot modeled 27 trades, generating 47% return per annum. That experiment attracted significant attention from professional and institutional investors. Future development Today we are witnessing the birth of a new entity in the world of investments and distributed autonomous organisations — a symbiotic decentralised hybrid investment fund. It’s inspiring that our team and active community are right at the heart of these tectonic shifts. Risk disclosure: Everything we post and release is for analytical and educational purposes only.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count.

Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .

BTC/USD is dancing with $7,000; the level we explored in an earlier publication. The 61.8% Fib retracement level with the last swing high of $8,770 and a low of $7,090 is offering immediate resistance above $7,000.\nWhile on CNBC’s \"Squawk Box\" segment, Wall Street’s own Warren Buffet and the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon warned investors to be wary of virtual currencies. Warren Buffet said, “Just beware” while Jamie reckoned, \"I don't want to be a Bitcoin spokesman,\" The two have been Bitcoin’s critics for a while now, for instance in May this year, Warren said that Bitcoin is \"probably rat poison squared.\"\nBitcoin has suffered the biggest slide from the near $20,000 highs it traded last year in December. The crypto has been unable to break past the long-term resistance at $10,000 for a while now, however, there is a weak bullish trend that began earlier this month. But the general trend is still bearish. The multi-week descending trend is approaching a breakout that could see Bitcoin finally attack $8,000 for the first time in June.

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

cryptocurrency. Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

That value is based on the company's assets and future earnings power. When you buy bitcoin, you're betting that someday, for some reason, you'll be able to unload your bitcoin to someone else at a higher price -- assuming that it doesn't get stolen first .\nYou could play the bitcoin \"greater fool\" game, and it might work out if you get lucky. But buying shares of high-quality companies is a much better strategy. Which stocks should you buy? Take a look at International Business Machines ( NYSE:IBM ) , Canopy Growth ( NYSE:CGC ) , and SolarEdge ( NASDAQ:SEDG ) .\nImage source: Getty Images.\nA blockchain company Tim Green (International Business Machines): If you want some exposure to blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underlies bitcoin, without taking a ton of risk , IBM is your best bet. While IBM rarely leads the pack when it comes to new technologies, blockchain is an exception. The company has already worked with more than 400 clients on blockchain projects. The most notable example: A joint venture with shipping giant Maersk to build a global trade digitization platform.\nWhile IBM's blockchain business has plenty of potential, there's not much downside if the technology doesn't pan out. The company has bet on cloud computing and artificial intelligence to drive its turnaround, and blockchain is more icing on the cake than anything else. IBM doesn't need blockchain to succeed. If you buy bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, which have no intrinsic value whatsoever, all you have is downside.\nInvesting in IBM does come with some risk. The company is still working through its transformation, and revenue only began growing again at the end of 2017. The company's cloud business is growing quickly, but its various legacy businesses are shedding sales fast enough to offset that growth. And while AI is a key component of IBM's strategy , the company doesn't disclose much about how much revenue its Watson AI system is generating. If IBM's growth businesses slow down, or if they prove less profitable than what they're replacing, the stock may remain stuck in the doldrums.\nBut IBM is a lot less risky than buying bitcoin. With the stock trading for just 10.5 times the company's adjusted earnings guidance and sporting an 4.4% dividend yield, there's plenty of upside if IBM can deliver.\nThis stock made investors more money than bitcoin in the last one year Neha Chamaria (Canopy Growth): The anticipation of minting dizzying amounts of money easily overshadows the strong possibility of not making a safe landing, often leading many to make irrational investing decisions. Buying bitcoin is one of them, as the insane level of volatility and other risks associated with the cryptocurrency make it nothing short of a speculative investment, at least for now.\nInstead, how about looking at stocks that give you bitcoin-like thrill but are still proven businesses with big growth potential if things fall into place? Marijuana stock Canopy Growth is what I have in mind right now.\nYou see, Canada-based Canopy Growth is already the largest pot stock in the world today, so you'd have actually made more money in Canopy shares than bitcoin in the past one year. Of course, Canopy Growth's valuation now feels like bitcoin at its peak, but there's a difference. While bitcoin had no visible catalyst to run higher, recreational cannabis could be on its way to legalization in Canada after medical marijuana that's already legal in the nation for several years now. If that happens, it would open the doors to a huge market for Canopy, which already has a solid foothold in the pot industry, massive production capacity, and a distribution channel and partnerships that have been the envy of other producers.\nLet me warn you: I still believe Canopy is an expensive and risky bet at current prices, but if bitcoin is luring you today, Canopy is an equally thrilling yet a relatively lower-risk substitute simply because the marijuana business is still real, unlike cryptocurrency.\nYou don't need to buy a cryptocurrency to earn huge profits Rich Smith (SolarEdge): What stock is a better buy than bitcoin? If you ask me, almost any stock is -- inasmuch as a stock represents a percentage ownership in a business, a business has the potential to grow over time, and that growth has the potential to produce more profits every year from now to infinity.\nA bitcoin... doesn't. It's just a piece of notional currency that may or may not have scarcity value, depending on whether it proves useful in the future or is abandoned as useless. Granted, bitcoin does appeal to some investors because its notional value can grow rapidly -- but then again, so can the value of stocks, including my pick today: SolarEdge.\nFor example, bitcoin has risen roughly 220% in price over the past year, but SolarEdge stock is up 254%. It's literally been a better investment than bitcoin already.\nAs you may or may not know, SolarEdge makes solar inverters -- the electronic widgets that transform direct current energy collected from solar panels into alternating current electricity that can turn on the lights at your home. It's a valuable business that generates substantial profits -- $106 million in GAAP earnings over the past 12 months alone and an even more impressive $144 million in free cash flow.\nSolarEdge is also a growing business. As solar power gains broader acceptance around the globe, analysts believe SolarEdge's profits will grow 22% annually on average over the next five years. Ordinarily, I'd ballpark a stock with these characteristics at roughly $3.2 billion in value. But today, SolarEdge stock costs less than $2.8 billion -- $2.5 billion ex-cash.\nAt better than a 20% discount to intrinsic value, I think SolarEdge is a much better investment than bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim green", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cgc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T16:00:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cca05f46bd30a7114770e707a20a4d7fb26a5982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS250baFYShHb2A0UT9WJ0TM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cca05f46bd30a7114770e707a20a4d7fb26a5982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS250baFYShHb2A0UT9WJ0TM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nWe are going to pay you for each invited user and for friends they will lead.

Auctioned for Cryptocurrencies June 7, 2018 Visit the original article *\nCryptocurrency adoption has progressively spread to new industries in order to disrupt their markets. The art trading business is the new sector looking to use Bitcoin et al. in order to expand payment options available for investors in works of art. A London art gallery has announced it will auction a portion of Andy Warhol’s work for cryptocurrencies. Art World Accepting Bitcoin on Andy Warhol Auction\n’14 Small Electric Chairs’ (1980), by Andy Warhol, will be the world’s first high-value, blue-chip art auction using Maecenas’ distributed ledger technology. Maecenas, a blockchain platform dedicated to democratizing the access to the fine arts has partnered with Dadiani Fine Art to make Dadiani Syndicate the first fine art gallery in the U.K. to accept payments in cryptocurrency.\nThe art gallery will put 49% of the Warhol work up for sale on June 20. Valued at $5.6 million (729 Bitcoin), the reserve price is set at $4 million (520 Bitcoin). The auction will be compliant to the laws in the U.K. and all buyers will be subject to full Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.\nEleesa Dadiani, the founder of Dadiani Syndicate, aims to render the future of fine art investments to global reach with cryptocurrency being capable of broadening the market as the world opens its arms to the new wealthy people that emerged from the digital currency market.\n“Beyond this, Maecenas and Dadiani are launching the world’s largest and first tokenised art fund through the blockchain. This will simplify and expand art investment even further. Our shared vision is being implemented in the most exciting way – now we both look forward to embracing the resulting evolution of art investment.”\nThe final price for Warhol’s painting at the auction will be determined by a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain. The art business could, however, be a trap for many cryptocurrency holders as fraudulent pieces of art on the market are estimated to be as high as 40% and costs could go up to $6 billion a year, according to blockchain identity company Codex Protocol .\nThe auction of Andy Warhol’s ’14 Small Electric Chairs’ will help transform the art market, Maecenas CEO Marcelo García Casil said. “We’re making history. This Warhol is the first artwork of many more to come.”\nIn January, four paintings were bought with cryptocurrencies at Art Stage Singapore through a partnership with Aditus Pay, a distributed ledger technology platform that brings the world of luxury to the cryptocurrency world.

How does this happen? When support breaks down and a market moves to new lows, buyers begin to hold off. This is because buyers are constantly seeing cheaper prices being established and want to wait for a bottom to be reached. At the same time, there will be traders who are selling in panic or simply being forced out of their positions. The trend continues until the selling is depleted and belief starts to return to buyers that the prices will not decline further. Trend-following strategies buy markets once they have broken through resistance and sell markets once they have fallen through support levels. Trends can be dramatic and prolonged, too. Because of the magnitude of moves involved, this type of system has the potential to be the most successful Forex trading strategy. Trend-following systems use indicators to tell when a new trend may have begun but there’s no surefire way to know of course. Here’s the good news. If the indicator can distinguish a time when there’s an improved chance that a trend has begun, you are tilting the odds in your favour. The indication that a trend might be forming is called a breakout. A breakout is when the price moves beyond the highest high or lowest low for a specified number of days. For example, a 20-day breakout to the upside is when the price goes above the highest high of the last 74190\nhttps://www.x-crypto.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T00:16:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79f6c861d41e79f96c8581b613e1b097c3b62464", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY7SLT07unSi4PcPaqEmUF0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Selling items online for Bitcoin or crypto", "title_full": "Selling items online for Bitcoin or crypto", "published": "2018-06-07T02:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79f6c861d41e79f96c8581b613e1b097c3b62464", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY7SLT07unSi4PcPaqEmUF0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mersal", "published": "2018-06-07T02:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Selling items online for Bitcoin or crypto", "text": "Quote: from: olubams on June 05, 2018, 05:23:49 PM Quote: from: Walrus1 on March 06, 2018, 12:35:42 AM Hey dudes hope you are well.

SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services. The two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.”\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” added van Eck.\nVanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a\nseries of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF.\nSolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\n“In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.”\nThe ETF is expected to list on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.vaneck.com/?abp2=noid&amp;country=us&amp;utm_source=veg&amp;utm_medium=press-release"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan van eck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T03:18:28.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c24ee84529cec14dd653da7b52ee9b650f64f353", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLw7zqIY5r5RKQicMM49k3XsRHl1pEm61mk5sFI6IopymQR8Q5xn1P9lFuICP1jZQAn3MoYrnQew--", "site_full": "www.prweb.com", "site": "prweb.com", "site_section": "http://www.prweb.com/rss2/daily.xml", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "PRWeb - Daily News Feed", "title": "Countdown to BCI Summit in New York City on June 11-12, 2018: Making Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Investment More Accessible, One Person at a Time", "title_full": "Countdown to BCI Summit in New York City on June 11-12, 2018: Making Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Investment More Accessible, One Person at a Time", "published": "2018-06-07T02:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10842, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c24ee84529cec14dd653da7b52ee9b650f64f353", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLw7zqIY5r5RKQicMM49k3XsRHl1pEm61mk5sFI6IopymQR8Q5xn1P9lFuICP1jZQAn3MoYrnQew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T02:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Countdown to BCI Summit in New York City on June 11-12, 2018: Making Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Investment More Accessible, One Person at a Time", "text": "Countdown to BCI Summit in New York City on June 11-12, 2018: Making Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Investment More Accessible, One Person at a Time Share Article BCI Summit is making cryptocurrency investment education more accessible.

Jun/06/2018\nWILL KENTUCKY OR TENNESSEE WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nKentucky legislators will already have missed the boat on legalized sports betting this session.\nThis is the state that years ago prompted the online gambling industry to descend upon Frankfort after former Governor Steve Beshear attempted to confiscate over 100 domain names from companies taking action from Kentucky citizens. Ultimately, the Court there prevented him from doing so.\nThere have been plenty of newspaper editorials in the state suggesting that legalized sports betting could help the state's deficit.\nThis is home, too, to Churchill Downs and they have expressed interest in offering sports wagering. Obviously, Churchill Downs has plenty of clout.\nAlex Rankin, chairman of the board of Churchill Downs Inc., said in an interview with Kentucky.com before this year's Kentucky Derby that the casino and racing company is deeply interested in the prospects of sports betting.\n\"Obviously the regulatory environment has to change. It would be something we'd take a hard look at, and we're doing a lot of thinking about,\" said Rankin. \"I think real-money gambling on the Internet (is) a subject we're paying great attention to. I would think, depending on how it sorts out, if it's a possibility we'd take a look at it.\nThe Kentucky legislature had its chance earlier this year to act on a sports wagering bill and did nothing.\n\"I told them so,\" said state Sen. Julian Carroll, D-Frankfort, when reached Monday about his bill to provide a framework for sports betting in Kentucky if the high court allowed it. \"They didn't even take it up in committee.\"\nAs for Tennessee, State Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Collierville was hoping to introduce legislation that would allow sports betting in the state with K-12 education reaping some of the benefits, according to the senator's Twitter account. That was mid-May, so far nothing. And there won't be any action until the next legislative session in 2019 the earliest.\nNashville Democrat House member Jason Powell is on board though, making for a truly bipartisan effort.\n\"I am all for sports gaming and looking at those changes, but the fact remains that is just a small percentage of the revenue we can tap into if we allow casino gaming in the State of Tennessee,\" he told News 2.\nNeedless-to-say, Kentucky and Tennessee gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex rankin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve beshear", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kentucky derby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "churchill downs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "churchill downs inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfort", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:53:36.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1b8138232a1f96aa9324a64f35a98f630b4054a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZO5TufI3Y8agwHjs.St7pY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin Hit $ 40000 in 2018...??", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin Hit $ 40000 in 2018...??", "published": "2018-06-07T02:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1b8138232a1f96aa9324a64f35a98f630b4054a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZO5TufI3Y8agwHjs.St7pY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ogman22", "published": "2018-06-07T02:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin Hit $ 40000 in 2018...??", "text": "Quote: from: bparkash09 on March 25, 2018, 09:38:45 AM Everybody want to see the price of Bitcoin above $50000\nbecause in 2016 we see the price of Bitcoin near about $250 to $300\nbut suddenly in 2017 Bitcoin growing very fast so that all crypto lover in waiting can Bitcoin Touch $40000 in 2018.\nWhat you think about it.

Jun 7, 2018\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak calls Bitcoin [BTC] ‘pure’. In addition to this, Steve also mentions that he is not a Bitcoin [BTC] investor but only bought Bitcoin [BTC] to experiment.\nSteve Wozniak talks about how much he is intrigued with Bitcoin and mathematics. He also mentioned that he currently owns one Bitcoin and two Ether. He also constantly emphasizes on how similar Bitcoin is to the internet and expects Bitcoin to bring across the revolution internet has brought across.\nThe Apple Co-Founder talks about his strong belief in mathematics, purity, and science as defining the world. According to him, Bitcoin is mathematically defined as a circle and there’s a way that it’s distributed. He considers Bitcoin [BTC] pure as there’s no person or company running it despite which it continues to grow and survive and this to him is ‘something that is natural… and more important than human conventions.’\nHe also says that the main reason he sold his $700 BTC was due to the overwhelming price fluctuations in the market. He says:\n“I never invested in Bitcoin, I was actually a little worried. Once, all of a sudden the price went up and I had a lot of money in Bitcoin, I said, wait a minute, I only bought to experiment.”\nWhen asked whether Bitcoin will continue to dominate the market with the rise of other platforms like Ethereum and Ripple, he replied:\n“We’ve seen a hundred sort of Bitcoin copies, some are faster, some are centralised control, some have other advantages, only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… I totally buy into that…How the math on Bitcoin that it was so correct that it still works.”\nHe also talks about Bitcoin [BTC]’s price in the future and says that because of Bitcoin’s regulated quantity, the value is down to the demand and supply, and Bitcoin saw a hike to $20000 for a period because ‘more and more people want it.’ He adds:\n“So if the demand increases and becomes more and more popular for more things and people start using it, there is no supply; it’s limited. In terms of dollar, yes bitcoin will go up and up in time… things might be sloppy at first and things that change that much in life take a long time to change, they tend to go slowly. We had a crash in the internet age and I see that going on with a lot of blockchain things including Bitcoin itself right now.”\nSteve further says that it’s going to take about 10-15 years for Blockchain to become the next widespread technology. He compares blockchain to the internet and says that just the way internet had promised to provide so many services online like bank reservations and airplane reservations, it faced a big crash as all the companies had competed. He continues:\n“And here it is, in 2018 all of our life, everything we do with these third-party apps to this day, oh my gosh, this saved me, such a wonderful world. It was the world we talked about than but it just doesn’t happen instantly because people will have to have their mind set changed, culture and tradition and status quo and the way things are doesn’t change that rapidly/ instantly when it’s that huge.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T11:40:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72cbfc93b1b6f8b519d240bda4f8c7b40741278e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz6tqUIJgu8Pt1lxiG2bCnz1is4xNAjN5ld_kD8Wb7Ce6Oz1Jvb125yU2Y59fpv9G.c0cqyNZkp.JJZg957cgHBQKO2_Lqn1hIckSMw5sMtZL2Ds2xRahiO", "site_full": "fortune.com", "site": "fortune.com", "site_section": "http://fortune.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Fortune", "title": "On Earnings Calls, ‘Fortnite’ Is Now Mentioned More Than ‘Bitcoin’", "title_full": "On Earnings Calls, ‘Fortnite’ Is Now Mentioned More Than ‘Bitcoin’", "published": "2018-06-07T02:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-957063534.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72cbfc93b1b6f8b519d240bda4f8c7b40741278e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz6tqUIJgu8Pt1lxiG2bCnz1is4xNAjN5ld_kD8Wb7Ce6Oz1Jvb125yU2Y59fpv9G.c0cqyNZkp.JJZg957cgHBQKO2_Lqn1hIckSMw5sMtZL2Ds2xRahiO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kevin Kelleher", "published": "2018-06-07T02:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "On Earnings Calls, ‘Fortnite’ Is Now Mentioned More Than ‘Bitcoin’", "text": "By Kevin Kelleher June 6, 2018\nThe business world loves a good buzzword. Witness the number of big companies that have started talking about Bitcoin, ICOs, and all things crypto. But now there seems to be a term buzzing even louder than Bitcoin: Fortnite .\nCorporate executives discussing their financial performance on their quarterly earnings calls used “ Fortnite ” a total of 54 times during the past earnings season, according to an analysis by business news site MarketWatch of transcripts collected by FactSet. That topped the 45 times executives mentioned “Bitcoin” or other cryptocurrencies in those calls.\nFortnite is a multiplayer action shooter game from Epic Games that has become wildly popular this year. The game has 14 million monthly active users around the world and, since launching on iOS in March, has often been the top-grossing game in Apple’s App Store.\nSome sports teams have grown worried their star players are growing addicted to it. Many parents are feeling the same way. But the game is not only promising to bring new gamers into the market, it’s helping to mainstream streaming-video services like Amazon’s Twitch .\nSome of the executive comments came from Epic Games’ rivals, who generally spun Fortnite’s success as an overall plus for the industry. “If you look back over the 20 or 30 years, the innovation that one game team has done has been going through the whole industry,” said Electronic Arts chief financial officer Blake Jorgenson. “It’s fantastic, and we welcome innovators like Fortnite .”\nOthers discussed the game’s impact on their families. “My son who is eight years-old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend,” said Snap chief strategy officer Imran Khan, assuring an analyst that Fortnite fans weren’t using Snap less. Owen Mahoney, CEO of game maker Nexof, made a similar admission : “I played Fortnite last weekend with my 14-year-old and 5 of his buddies from school.”\nCompanies in other industries are seeing a benefit from Fortnite’s popularity. Logitech said demand from new gamers is boosting demand for its gaming hardware. And chipmaker AMD said the trend is helping sales of its graphics processors, which are used to power many video games.\nIt’s rare to see a single video game have such a broad impact, but if Fortnite and other multiplayer action games continue to catch fire, the business world could be buzzing about them for some time.

Jun/06/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from The Dakotas, Iowa and Nebraska will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. Last month the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of legalization of sports betting on a state-by-state basis. This means that each state will need to decide whether they wish to offer the activity with the required legal framework occurring after this year's World Cup. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL THESE STATES WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nRemarkably, North Dakota was very forward thinking back in the day ahead of all other states with legislators considering the legalization of online poker as far back as the early 2000's. So it should come as no surprise that this state is already contemplating offering legalized sports wagering. Little more is known beyond this point.\nSouth Dakota is also open to the idea though no serious steps have been taken at this time. An amendment would be required. If an amendment would clear all its hurdles, the outh Dakota Department of Revenue would recommend that betting occur only at places licensed by the state’s commission on gaming.\n“We’ve all been watching this for a long time,” said Joe Massa, former chief operating officer at Grand Falls Casino & Golf Resort, who spent more than two decades in the casino industry in South Dakota and Iowa. “(Gambling on sports) is something a lot of people are interested in and a lot of it goes on now. It would need to be regulated, but right now governments are missing out on the opportunity for tax revenues.”\nThe Iowa state legislature drafted a house study bill in February that would allow for establishing wagering accounts at Iowa casinos – the state has 19, including Grand Falls – with access to online betting. It’s a bill that will be waiting for policy-makers the next session. Legislation would be reintroduced next January.\nAs for Nebraska, that state has no plans to offer legalized sports betting any time soon despite the rabid College Football fans that reside here.\nTherein lies the problem. Omaha plays host to the NCAA College World Series and NCAA Basketball Playoffs each year and fears upsetting the NCAA.\nThe current NCAA policy says no session of an NCAA championship “may be conducted in a state with legal wagering that is based on single-game betting or the outcome of any event ... in a sport in which the NCAA conducts a championship.”\nIn response to the court’s ruling, NCAA Chief Legal Officer Donald Remy said the organization was still reviewing the decision to understand overall implications for college sports.\n“We will adjust sports wagering and championship policies to align with the direction from the court,” he said in a statement.\nNeedless-to-say, gamblers in these states will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south dakota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the dakotas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north dakota", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:53:49.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1fcfaf5d98270437ba61a345679d1a8b5800b15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQroXyUnpLvnfJ3wk2RbGiOlWxQaev6Tbv1NveKj4xj8Eg8ZHKLavqlIRQcRj0bu7w-", "site_full": "mountainmodernlife.com", "site": "mountainmodernlife.com", "site_section": "http://mountainmodernlife.com/home/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Comments on: Home", "title": "By: bitcoin calculator uk", "title_full": "By: bitcoin calculator uk", "published": "2018-06-07T02:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://326sn8ptvla193461rea09tj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diy-painted-globe-for-wedding-guestbook-table-decor-mountainmodernlife.com_.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1fcfaf5d98270437ba61a345679d1a8b5800b15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQroXyUnpLvnfJ3wk2RbGiOlWxQaev6Tbv1NveKj4xj8Eg8ZHKLavqlIRQcRj0bu7w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin calculator uk", "published": "2018-06-07T02:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "By: bitcoin calculator uk", "text": "Print out of letters/silhouette you want to use/You could also use stickers Step 1: Clean your globe\nI clean just about everything with mineral spirits, especially stuff I pick up from thrift stores but you can even use a lysol wipe or wet paper towel. Step 2: Tape off any sections you don’t want to get paint on\nI used frog tape to cover up any area I wanted to avoid accidentally splashing paint on, but you could use any kind of painter’s tape. Step 3: Print out the letters to whatever word you want to spell on the globe\nYou can use a font you already have or could check out some free fonts at dafont.com. I actually found a font I really liked at LostType.com which you can get here . I then opened it in Adobe Illustrator to remove the thinner outline, re-sized the letters to make them 300% larger and printed them out. You could also use a silhouette machine or even large stickers. Step 4: Cut your letters out\nI’m working on getting a steadier hand so don’t worry if you don’t cut each letter perfectly, just try to cut as close to the outline as possible. Step 5: Tape your letters to the globe\nI used double-sided tape but you could use whatever you prefer, I actually think a thicker tape would have been easier when removing the letters later. Just decide where you want your letters to be positioned and then tape them in place. I wanted to make sure part of a letter covered up Ventura, CA since that’s where Eric and I met, and that way when I removed the letter later that part of the globe would show through. Step 6: Paint your globe!\nI decided to paint mine white but the sky is the limit so paint it whatever color you like! Step 7: Remove your letters\nI would recommend removing the letters right after you paint – maybe use some tweezers to help lift up the edges. I actually had to meet the (future) in-laws for dinner so my letters sat for a few hours and then they stuck to the globe a bit when I tried to remove them. I think that if I would have removed them right away it would have been easier, that and using a thicker tape. If yours ends up like mine though, no worries, just clean up the edges with a razor blade, old tweezers, small flathead screwdriver, etc. Step 8: Enjoy your new DIY painted globe!\nWe placed the globe on our wedding guestbook table as decor, but you could even use it as your guestbook, or display it in your home {which is where we have it now}.\nSo, what do you think of the DIY Painted Globe?

VanEck will provide marketing services whereas SolidX will act as the sponsor.\nSend this to a friend Hi, I thought you might find this interesting:SEC Receives Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Filing Cancel\nThe dream is still alive for a potential bitcoin ETF.\nOn Wednesday (June 6), VanEck announced a partnership with SolidX to list a “physically-backed” bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) that “will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin.”\nThis is the third attempt made by VanEck for a bitcoin ETF who first filed for a bitcoin futures ETF in August 2017 before withdrawing the application a month later as requested by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). In this attempt, the companies will base the fund on physical bitcoins instead of futures. Looking for Blockchain Stocks? Get My Free Report\nVanEck will provide marketing services towards the ETF while SolidX will act as the sponsor while both companies will work together with regulators.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold ’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck said in the release.\nAccording to the SEC filing done by the companies on Wednesday, if approved shares of the fund will be priced at 25 bitcoins per share, which totals just under US$200,000, as means of attracting institutional investors.\nAs the fund will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin held by the trust, the filing states that the insurance will cover loss of bitcoin, theft, destruction, bitcoin in transit, computer hacks and loss of numerical codes (private keys), which are required to access bitcoin held by the trust.\nBloomberg reported that no fees have been set yet for the fund, but that it’ll be pricey compared to other ETFS due to the “risk and hassle” when it comes to trading cryptocurrencies.\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” van Eck said in Wednesday’s announcement. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nIndeed, it’s been a volatile year for the bitcoin price: since the start of 2018 the digital currency has tumbled from US$13,625 to a low of US$6,182.50 on February 5. As of 6:58 p.m. EST on Wednesday bitcoin was priced at US$7,657.56, representing a 0.50 percent increase over a 24-hour period.\nDon’t forget to follow us @INN_Technology for real-time news updates!\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Jocelyn Aspa, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.

suggests its best is yet to come, UK entrepreneur Alistair Milne suggested June 6 as prices inched towards $8000.\n2017 'Just A Warm Up' For Bitcoin Summarizing arguments on social media, Milne, who is known for his bullish long-term views on Bitcoin, forecast last year could be a \"warm up\" for growth between now and 2020.\nThe views capitalize on growing faith both within and beyond the cryptocurrency industry that Bitcoin will return to its recent former glories, this time with additional regulatory and mainstream investment support.\nMilne picked out Bitcoin as being \"still pre-mainstream\" as a key factor which could propel it to beat 2017's figures.\nIn addition, he noted, last December's all-time price highs came about with \"almost no institutional money\" present.\nAdditional regulation, the plethora of \"bubble\" claims made about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's \"tiny\" maximum market cap formed the remainder of the evidence.\nReasons 2017 might have been just a warm up for Bitcoin vs the next 18-24 months:\n– still pre-mainstream\n– almost no institutional money invested in 2017\n– new (regulated) gateways to crypto opening\n– $300bil is tiny\n– everyone was screaming bubble the entire time\n— Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) June 6, 2018\nA Slow Return To Top Form Despite BTC/USD losing in excess of 70% versus its all-time highs in 2018, preparations appear to be well underway for traditional finance to integrate cryptocurrency to a greater or lesser extent.\nHaving previous panned Bitcoin as a niche phenomenon, heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs are now actively pursuing offering Bitcoin futures trading , just six months after the first contracts launched to mixed success.\nAs Bitcoinist reported this week, other, more sympathetic players are catching up, with Susquehanna revealing it would begin operating not only futures but direct trading of Bitcoin and a selection of altcoins.\nFinancial firms meanwhile are undecided as to what extent such entries into the market will push up prices.\nA survey by pro-Bitcoin Fundstrat Global Advisors in April saw the majority of respondents claim BTC/USD would finish 2018 not significantly higher than current levels – between $10,000 and $20,000.\nWhat do you think about Alistair Milne's forecast for Bitcoin?
