Why? Because if you would imagine bitcpin keeps on increasing and we can't control that on and as well as the transaction it will be inevitable too to control. Hope you do understand now.\nIncreasing in transaction fee means good the demands of Bitcoins is growing so that's it .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:33:20.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "842754629ac66c93a27246f1c6ac9a7786e0e64b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5qLBMr9cZcdifkAXW6dQCin4EsmB27EeBxSi0Ltg.5h1XryP7XWjw.l2j2D8srOyrIguO7LOp4JvS_3rLlWOgBWYUoloLvg9.EZfhGFLrC2VrYn88bzaXro-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Goldman Sachs CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship", "title_full": "Goldman Sachs CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship", "published": "2018-05-20T14:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "842754629ac66c93a27246f1c6ac9a7786e0e64b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5qLBMr9cZcdifkAXW6dQCin4EsmB27EeBxSi0Ltg.5h1XryP7XWjw.l2j2D8srOyrIguO7LOp4JvS_3rLlWOgBWYUoloLvg9.EZfhGFLrC2VrYn88bzaXro-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-20T14:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Goldman Sachs CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blankfein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T15:19:54.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc83f20482b4e42d91594f19ca97039ace30e2e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbq5Qww9MxgeNI1Un7PKLLc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin current situation", "title_full": "Bitcoin current situation", "published": "2018-05-20T14:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc83f20482b4e42d91594f19ca97039ace30e2e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbq5Qww9MxgeNI1Un7PKLLc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MinerHQ", "published": "2018-05-20T14:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin current situation", "text": "Quote: from: zhanghoqi5 on May 08, 2018, 07:48:34 AM Bitcoin will not disappear or be banned because of the supervision of some countries.

Bitcoin Trader Review, SCAM Bitcoin Trader Is a Cryptocurrency Fraud! Posted on May 20,\nThe Bitcoin Trader software (not to be confused with Bitcoin Code) is a SCAM trading robot and we blacklisted it in our fair and impartial review and investigation. First a word of caution, we have warned our members about the recent surge in Bitcoin scams which are riding the recent wave of endless success stories about new Bitcoin Millionaires. It’s imperative you understand that the Bitcoin Trader Scam has nothing to do with legitimate or genuine Bitcoin Trading, and it is merely another get-rich-quick scheme designed to steal your money. Furthermore, the affiliate marketers and thieving brokers pulling the strings behind this filthy app are conspiring against you in a brazen attempt to defraud and steal your hard-earned money. It should also be noted that these online promoters usually employ stealthy SPAM email marketing tactics that penetrate your inbox. You should also be made aware that clicking on any of the links in your emails or spammy pop up message you may be receiving puts your computer or device at immediate risk of getting contaminated with a Trojan Horse or various forms of malware and spyware. This has been confirmed after our scam alerts center received multiple virus complaints related to the fraudulent Bitcoin Trader app. In short, this bogus system is an extremely piece of technology which was designed with pure malice and the deliberate attempt to defraud unsuspecting opportunity seekers looking to cash in on a trustworthy app. Keep reading to cheaters behind Bitcoin Trader and why our staff or researchers has ascertained that it is a confirmed financial scam.\n This Domain is Constantly Changing to Spoof and Trick You\nProof of SCAM Below you will see the Bitcoin Trader primary sales page. You should know that the commentary by Jake Tapper from CNN, Bill Gates, and Sir Richard Branson are completely and intentionally taken out of context and used as a form of fig leaf in order to hide and conceal the true intention of this filthy scheme.\nHere you will find the testimonial page of the Bitcoin Trader titled as “Hear From Our Members Who Rely On Our Software to Fund Their Luxury Lifestyles”. Again, these are all image bank actors, or alternatively just people who have had their pictures stolen without giving prior consent.\nAnd for the final nail in the coffin, here we have the Bitcoin Trader FAQ section which boasts a 99.4% level of accuracy . That is just not possible and a complete lie and fabrication. Any system with that level of accuracy would create instant millionaires, and we all know that is detached from reality and totally fallacious.\nBitcoin Trader Review – SCAM Software “Bitcoin Is Making People Rich And You Can Become The Next Millionaire” That is the first thing you see when looking at the sales page. This software is being marketed as an exclusive club for opportunity seekers looking to make insane returns and make fortunes. They claim they have retreats across the world and all you have to do is work a few minutes every day. That is their dirty sales pitch and how the software is presented.\nKey Differentiating Factors (More Lies) Laser-accurate Performance : Double or even triple your original investment with a 99.4% accuracy level.\nSuperior Technology : Advanced programming precedes market rates in 0.01 seconds so you have an “edge”.\nAward Winning Trading App : Awarded Number 1 in the trading software category for the US Trading Association.\nHow Does the SCAM Work? They give you the famous three steps about signing up, funding your account and immediately profiting. Behind the scenes what really happens is that you have unethical online promoters peddling the dirty software and then splitting the loot in what is commonly referred to as a revenue share scheme.\nIs it Free? Of course it is not. Access to this sham (for the lack of a better word) will cost you at least $250, and that money will be charged to your credit card by rogue offshore brokers looking to get their dirty fingers on your credit card.\nIn Reality What we are witnessing here is a complete farce and has nothing to do with real bitcoin or bitcoin trading. This is a classic get-rich-quick scheme with all the trimmings, so expect to get your wallet fleeced by thieving brokers. We have all the tell signs evident, namely hyped up or exaggerated claims of easy money, heaps of fake testimonials, inflated bank accounts, and outright lies. There is no narrative or any person who is presented as the person behind the software. Its just a pack of lies wrapped up in hype and hot air designed to bait you.\nOther Viral Scams Trending The ones to watch out for are Bitcoin Code and Auto Crypto 247 . Most likely the same fraudsters are behind both scams.\nForex EA Signals Versus Options Trading Robots If you are deliberating and not quite sure about what kind of trading app is best for you then it is perfectly normal. Our staff has compiled a short yet reputable list of consistent money-making machines. These are all showcased in our recommended section.\nBitcoin Trader Review Summary and Conclusions This software is a farcical scam and therefore entirely blacklisted in our revealing review and investigative report. For those of you who have already taken the bait and tested the waters by depositing or funding a real money trading account, you should know that Bitcoin Trader is a verified investment scam and you should not reinvest at any point and time. You should also be made aware that the con artists behind this fake trading robot are convicted felons with a checkered past and an extensive criminal history.

Click here to find out how to get R250 in a live account now.\nTt’s a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and the market become offers you to create a Bitcoin as well but first before we before we carry on maybe one of you can give us a fine if we readable and or if you can hear me so this makes us sure that’s that we we don’t talk for nothing you have from the right hand side you have got a little chat function hearing you loud and clear that’s that’s lovely okay they’re coming to us because we have many new names of participants and my name is Daniel fearing and beside of me and is my collective cationic yeah good evening also from my side I say good evening because for those of you who know us already we are in Germany we’re sitting in Germany and here we have already evening but as I can see where people from all over the world work which is of course awesome to us and we’re happy to have you in our session tonight today wherever you are and I would like to welcome you yes Dani said before we have today that session will be divided in two parts the first part where weeks with a bit theory about cryptocurrencies the modern expression and then we will do as usual life training and we will take a look at the market and we will just see what’s going on today the session is quite interesting something happen you’re always getting stronger again so we have much to talk about and before we go further maybe here you have okay we do it in later so we just start with our bit comes now we prepare the nice presentation to you and we just started we had a Bitcoin the first time when I’ve read this name it was about 2010 also the first article I wrote about the Bitcoin because we always write about new things and just to mention new things so you get sensitive is sensible for these things and I wrote an article about Bitcoin on the first price I have seen at this point was five dollar fifty three and now we can see the actual price a little bit later on and so the development was quite long commander here as well and as you can say and why what is the reason for this the Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency it’s just the opposite it’s just the opposite what we know about our monetary system so our money is losing the words and the Bitcoin diss gaining it and so it’s just the opposite and that’s the fantastic thing about it and then the cryptocurrency is yeah it’s nothing you can you can hold in your hand or it’s it’s just little Alec it’s digital and you have got a wallet but it’s more or less yeah online on any computer but and we explain more about this but it’s very hard for everybody to understand it from the very first beginning and begin one I had to think so much about it so and I’m still thinking about it and so it is really great though it’s something weird goddess and the crypto currency it’s a normal digital payment system and it was invented by an on that there’s nobody can be sure it was more or less installed by a programmer or maybe it’s more more like it was a programmer group and they called themselves Satoshi Nakamoto maybe even it was a company nobody really knows who or what is behind his name so it’s also kind of quick yeah so it is absolutely a blank box so Maya and this was in about 2008 in 2009 it was installed more or less the whole currency system they call it white paper but they sent out to the interested people and they are made a presentation more or less and the first price when the women the Bitcoin came out was about six cent Wow so is somebody of you who is got a take you later can work out in the moment we have prices about $2,300 okay yeah we have fun consolidation in Romania and we will take a look later on your life chart because Marcus does come offers trading for crypto currencies most of you have seen probably already and will go to this later and the good thing is it’s restricted from the amount of bitcoins which can be produced in at the end when you gather all together it will be about 21 million not more this can make you sure that the Bitcoin won’t be loose once yeah worth it will gain so if it gets more and more common what happened in the past in the past two three years yeah it gave and on God and and so I think it’s more good uptrend yeah without any big interruptions and now you see that it’s really everywhere everybody is talking about bitcoins and of course there is also important information you don’t have to buy and really the whole one and depends of course where you buy it buy a pendant you don’t have to buy all of it we just can also buy this and part of it yeah if you don’t have enough money for so instantly but what is so special about the Bitcoin also it’s it’s an independent and a currency so we have no consistently election to the banking system directly yeah it is a peer-to-peer solution so if the users make the exchange to each other without any regulation in between so it’s absolutely independent and it’s more or less nobody knows who paid whom that’s why it’s so fascinating and wide so a fastness the whole world because you really have possibilities which were not known until now and it’s growing especially in the last year’s and it now imagine what’s going on or what will going on when young people who grew grow up now and maybe in in five years or whatever when there will be much more cryptocurrency is probably not only Bitcoin because we already have now many more and they are growing so something is going to change dramatically yeah and the whole monetary system in the world because it loses the main stations I would say they lose the control over and transactions and what people are doing so now everybody wants to have Bitcoin and yeah I’m I’m really curious how this well the bellman so it and all these transactions if somebody pays a private person or let’s say by some buttons or some drivers act but all these transactions they are we call it that’s the only thing which is known from everybody and these transactions are more or less in a public letter it’s called blockchain so it’s stored and recorded there the people know and somebody changed to bitcoins in the USA or whatever which this number who knows that I mean only the Central Station probably and I would say that not everybody know everybody can know what everybody is doing everybody L know without without know who it was yet what I mean they can only see it some transaction done yeah but it’s without any names behind it’s like a it’s like a banknotes friend my my notes Morris virtual session and I am sure this will really change everything in the future so now you see it’s really growing and yeah interesting and development yeah and the last point all almost we mention it already they’re connected to this blockchain let’s get a condition you have to download small software which gives you the connectivity to the blockchain and so everybody is connected to everybody and this makes it and of course they are and this is very exciting to trade it because there are of course possibilities for speculative or trader then I know people who really bought this some time ago and they’re really a lot of money invested and they made great games so it’s also very interesting Daria trading so you don’t really have to one thing is when you really buy it and the other thing is that you can also trade it like for example markets.com offers you the possibility to trade them it’s like kind of see if these get to trade them without buying them and so you can really also make money and it’s interesting it’s really exciting and we will show you on a trading platform how it works yeah but it’s not everything is so sunny we have also shadows yeah and monarchy yeah and the thing is you the bitcoin is only an algorithm and you have to store it some somewhere and normally you’ll leave it in in your personal wallet that’s how it is called and this personal wallet is a more or less banking account and but Hecker and these black guys they can they can primary hair break in steal the algorithm and have got the money and that’s what happened several times so far that’s why it took so long that the bitcoin came up more or less in the past and in the past few years I would say nothing happened really seriously but before there was a big robbery in Japan and some hackers have stolen bitcoins in the birthday occult mall and yeah only the culture yeah it fits on our us basic mourneth and they have stolen 125 million plus cool mmm that on USB stick that’s a modern way to rob a bank without any gun give me the keyboard that’s it yeah and then USB stick it so yes it is this isn’t another version so you just have to decipher it anyway everybody now is buying them and of course hoping to make a lot of money and there is Kent but you just have to be aware of what you are doing one thing M who is who is taking care for the for the blockchain for the whole network these are the – the – are the producers of the Bitcoin so far we have about 19 million so only two more million to go and then it will be over the whole game with the mining but they take care for the blockchain and discuss electricity discuss main power manpower energy thinking and breathing and therefore they get after a certain time to get the bitcoins so they get paid more or less from the whole system but the system is not paying for it it was created artificially so the secret system it’s like printing money and of course there but there are also other cryptocurrencies coming a newcomer one of them we showed you already this is a Bitcoin of course the most famous one but in nowadays because the most of the people they are looking now or the mr. train for the urban let’s say it in this place they miss the train and want to have a cheap another reservation in cryptocurrency was the same was the same the story for the future more or less and one of them is the etherium how to do English people say or in fact Jesus okay I think it sounds so cool eater yes because you really cannot really grab it or whatever and it’s like either it’s everywhere and one one more is the light coin but the last two ones are not so famous so far you penetrated this market yes I think yes it’s more an investment for the future I don’t think they’re so far they’re only a hundred and twenty thousand shops worldwide who accept the Bitcoin so mmm and they guess about two and a half to four and a half million people are owning Bitcoin so far well so but no exact exact figures you can get so if you think about it so you have here maybe some other solutions if you didn’t yeah I mean Bitcoin is now quite expensive we say it now it is expensive but we don’t really know how it will be in one year or two years sure we cannot we don’t have any glass bowl to look in but still there are new ones and I am sure there will be much more coming out growing because people like this solution like this idea and you see how fast it’s really spreading around the world so there will be much more to come but today we also want to tell you how to trade it by markets calm so then you can really trade it without buying it so you don’t really have to buy it but before we go to our trading platform here are our contacts when you want to have any questions or you want to know something more about trading or indicators whatever you can contact us at info at 4x – CENTCOM for example it’s our company we offer different when we offer default services and epics so now let’s go to the trading platform oh it’s not open it underneath here we have our trading platform you can see and so we are already locked in and you can see we have here our Bitcoin I changed time frame a little bit yes because place for hours already and more lately quite a large candle we will need to make it a little bit slowly or smaller to take a look and you see there are almost on green candles so you can see we have here early yeah uptrend and now a small consolation and now I’m really the indicators they are quite in extreme I would say we even have a divergence e MACD is down so we have here even starting to change the direction but we have here also it’s overdone for the moment but you never know it depends on your time frame of course it’s what a technical market it’s one a notion among a market sure and also and you have to get informed news from the mental market I would say because if something happens then you have to be informed so maybe we don’t have a smaller time frame and then you see the movements that’s quite enough action in it is not not a question but it’s more or less an emotional market for let’s say many many people who are buying bitcoins in wasting money and not trading the money so I want fast you can see this goes up and down a little bit in whatever but more or less is it stable for the moment so how can you trade it so it’s quite easy you trade the same as any other instrument at market calm you can see we have here you can see we have here our Bitcoin our window and you see here send by so it’s really typical how in the same way when you want to buy you going by and here you have here contracts and you can choose here the amount of your contracts you see the price here you can play stop-loss take profit so it’s really the same is training anything else so I think most of you what did you expected for currency yeah but we were supposed to show it and here we have also ether ether room as you can see we placed them already when you search for an instrument you go here under search and you can just write the name and you will see and where to find them we placed all of them where we can let’s take a look at the ether it’s much cheaper as you can see still at the moment it can be different and you can also here take this yellow star and place it to your favorite list if you have such one and if you want to read it on the red world basis so you have it and here the right coin or there is really cheap compared to there so it’s about the red coin so it could be a good idea but you can see it’s in one so I am sure there will be more and for us it’s cool of course because we get more to trade and we can have more possibilities to find something about as Danny said it’s nothing else in the currency because it’s the same with also here when you go Australia under waste over us or euro Japanese yen is the same the same principle how you trade it and market calm they are quickly faster offer you pretty early the possibility so now you have to change for yourself if you wish to to also be active in this sector well I think that’s all about our Bitcoin for the first time for now if you have any question you can as I said before write us an email or here in the chat function you can ask but I think that’s the most important thing you have to know so we explain it to you and now still we have some time so maybe we’ll take a look at the markets all together what was going on today or what is going on today and I would suggest we start with euro dollar because it was quite interesting today and we were also on the long sides before and make a nice window and we are quite happy and in a good mood now let’s say we were long yesterday already and I and we decided to cut the position with a small profit of 750 for years and 7 pips and after certain time we realized the market is not going down or there is no reaction on the downside so if a market is not falling then it must be very much is right yeah the first time is when you see that the indicators are moving down and you don’t see any movement in the price so that’s a sign that it doesn’t really want to go down or then it’s you have to be aware or should be aware and that the trend is still strong and it’s not over yet so that’s why we decided so at the level at fifty thirteen and 11350 and we went again long and then we closed a little bit below 140 it was our trade from today but now I can see I had the feeling that it will go even over 114 but I wasn’t patient enough and I said okay the market yesterday was really slowly so we had almost no movement maybe a range of 20 15 pips which is of course not that funny if you are a short time trailer so that’s why today and we decided to take the money and run and we did it but now afterwards you can see of course the price is still going up and the trend is still active level as but I don’t blame us because tomorrow the g20 everything will start and it will come out a lot of news a lot of news and and unexpected things so you never can be sure what happened I mean the talking tonight already air but yeah the nice dinner but that’s an important point and you should be aware about it because these are fundamental news which can really wait we don’t know what will happen there and we don’t know what they will really be talking about but sometimes they will come something out one sentence from somebody could be Donald Trump could be put in whatever and then it can really move the market and it can happen of course Friday is the day where we start the weekend so there is a little different law on the market so everybody tries to close their position for the weekend and when there’s such an unexpected message any unexpected message comes out then it will really move the market and it’s quite a risky game tomorrow to be in the market that’s why we decided to close the position and now I don’t know if we do something tomorrow we will see how the markets I think we also have two more the chocolate exam yesterday two ones just further in the money yeah exactly that’s the next thing so we have to you just have to be a little bit so you have it in your mind that there are some fundamental news coming out you can of course the profit of it if you decide to but you just have to be prepared and have to be informed it’s always important for this news yeah so I think okay I think that the euro it still has some power on the upside but not that much anymore and maybe until one fourteen thirty versus space where we take a look at our indicators because when we look at thirty minutes then you can see that we have here indicators where we cannot see here very well at the moment so let’s change maybe for one hour and then we can see no we cannot see sorry for that let’s take maybe we look five minutes ahead on the upside so you see those two lines moving averages they are running still up so it is still there is no no sign for the for the change of the direction so it could be that we’ll have a side weight strength afterwards but I can imagine that the 114 said they will be touched before we have weakened and it was of course a quite a big effort to to go through 114 because it was a really strong resistance but now it’s through we had a breakout so this level will be a support for the next time and we can see that there is as I said of course 114th now we lost somehow our indicators and our chart I’m sorry for this maybe we will change the frame will change the something with the trading platform we – of course demo version because we are showing you everything but we have here maybe we will have to login again we will see we have to close it first we can go here out maybe and then try to login again maybe it will help but you don’t have to close it this way you can then we try to login again to the trading platform we’re sorry for this issue but we had not in our power so we just try to do our best and login again and we will see if it works then and we will just log in again and see if the indicator is getting better or not so now we want to show you what thing with your daughter we are finished with our analyzes because there will be a range between 114 and 114 30 I would say four that’s what our indicator shows and of course always as we told you before this or education when we show you and it is just to explain you how our trading system works so now is maybe take a look at the different currency part and is its Australian dollar yeah we have here maybe first we take a look at a bigger timeframe like 30 minutes or one hour to take a look on the bigger trend and we have here falling trend as you can see so short trend the market is going up down sorry the indicators are also on the downside to hostak and there and MACD is also negative red color so there’s I think there’s some potential in a bigger timeframe when you change to five minutes or when we change to five minutes then we can see that there is still a little movement on the upside the indicators are still on the positives but I don’t think I would like to do anything here in Australian dollar because it’s not and really as a chart or or a situation where I can I feel comfortable it’s no signal for myself and if there is no signal for myself and I don’t know anything so let’s change maybe to something else or maybe your old Japan key and also quite interesting because we have here also a strong trend as you can see and maybe 30 minutes first exactly the way they can look at the bigger and now we can see that way they have really a strong movement strong move on the upside and that means that when you have such a strong move and there you need a lot of power to to have a consolidated consolidation so I think that there will also still be some potential on the the up side because yeah euro is getting stronger also against us Dora and it’s also always interesting to compare these both currency parse when you trade them because often we have their correlation that’s interesting to see and only 88.8% what Euro against the Japanese yen and ninety one salt I left two euros and it’s growing that’s the reason why it going oh here it is going up because they have to cover the positions but this gives also dynamically into the market but you can see the two lines here the blue one and the orange one these are you can read it here on top is as simple moving away from em exponential moving average mister in vista parameters of twelve and free and if they are walking beside quite clearly then you still in a bigger thread so so far till they are not crossing each other we are still in the long trend that’s quite simple okay well let’s go to five minutes but the picture should be the same more or less yeah the indicators are in extreme within five minutes there can be maybe only a little and move on the downside if at all but I think that there is the potential on the upside and we could take a look at the bigger timeframe to take a look where there will be the next resistance next important level when we take a look at the chart it’s no one No so we really have no house that we can compare that’s how we also read the chart chart this very important tool and it’s very important that you can read it and you know how to interpret it because it takes you a lot to define to find the highs and the lows and also the importance and supports and resistance but for getting long it’s too late if you see consolidation and I would say okay it’s nice to think over and to choose the no side but for the time being or for the moment and it’s a little bit too late to get in yes I would say no it’s not the right point right moment to get into the market so we take a look at the different currency we change the program well let’s go dependence we switch the channel like on TV that’s now British pound against US dollar well we had there a double top double high you can see and it was not possible for the market to go above 80 you can see attached 180 but it was not read was only a spike so and actually the real resistance is at about 120 970 and this area seems to be very strong resistance that’s why the market got the small disappointment and we had now falling prices again so now we are at 120 950 about this and five minutes are beginning to follow there Holden you are now in a big one it’s four hours so it doesn’t look to that it falls but in a smaller time frame the smaller time frame I agree hundred percent at least and I have a consolidation down to 129 something can be possible we have the next support where the first and the next support we have at 30 so there’s quite an important level and if the market goes through I 36:50don’t believe that it will happen in the next hours it can happen during the night so during that next 12 14 15 hours but not in the next two or three hours I don’t believe it because in England and Great Britain we have already closed the market in America yet they still trade but I think now it will be quiet immersive there won’t be much movement in the next hour so I think that there is a possibility for for the market to see one 29 30 that’s over tomorrow there could be more because when this we have the strong resistance and if it breaks then it can go down until the big figure 129 but it’s the future we cannot say now because it’s too we are short into it so one press conference couldn’t change anything can change everything more so it’s the risky thing with the facing for tomorrow but that’s our job yeah and of course you’ll see that the market doesn’t really want to go down it’s growing going up now quite quite fast I am a little bit surprised that we have now for the time being such a move it’s quite fast so we have like 10 tips with in I don’t know 15 10 seconds so it could be that we will the market tries to break through this 70 level as I told you which is a stronger resistance now it will be interesting so let’s stay here for a while because it will be very interesting to see live it would be if it goes through I can’t imagine I can’t but maybe they are already talking something at 3:20 we don’t know we don’t have to use on at the moment I just take a look in other currencies so it has nothing to do with euro because we have no movement at all nothing is changing and here this other I told you it’s the strong resistance so would be not easy to go through maybe you can hear our dog sorry for that if it’s too loud and but it is it’s always with us doing decisions I would like to see the singer put yeah let’s go there and take a look at this currency part will be short maybe it looks like a short here sorry for the quietness but sometimes before I say something I don’t like this picture really happens in this small time frame in a smaller time frame it’s definitely a short yeah I would say so because we have data stuff I think the indicators are falling and MACD is also falling but you have to take a look at this level and maybe we take a cross and show you that this lines is a support so we had two loaves the one is even deeper the first one here yes and then we have the other one which is not that deep but all this and they are support strong support so if somebody would like to go short now as to keep in his mind that there will be a support so the market will be stopped fast there will stop of course us dressing the whole era will be traded during the night so in the next 12 hours and that can be more movement more power in the markets we don’t know it No so not really an interesting we had interesting moves today already but now at the moment it’s a bit quiet and not that much is happening so we are not able to show you – how to make a trade because there’s nothing we can make you of course we control you a trade how to open the position make it for demonstration but maybe we take a look at gold that’s the real money oh yeah it’s obvious crypto unless money crypto things there all this time you go to trade in five minutes is not the best idea so we moved to a bigger timeframe 30 minutes but it goes more more or less right way so yeah it is strong sideways trend so when you take a look at it the whole picture the whole picture we have known our screen is just sideways not so easy and every trader nobody likes side westerns of course but the small colleagues silver even worse but now we can when we go back to the Singapore dollar now it’s really interesting but it’s going through so our I think our idea with the short is not this bad because our indicator Charlotte and the five minute is starting already so there’s potential yeah could be even during the night that it goes really thicker until the big figure and say let’s ocean it’s a short enough dynamic in the market so I guess he will carry on so you can see everybody is a little bit more quiet in the moment so I think you know what had not the best trading week or not the best week for trading America had a official of one of the biggest holidays monday was a British day more or less so if they lick was difficult to trade yeah because there weren’t that many chances it was quiet tried over were not the biggest and so I think everybody is waiting to be fresh on Monday again and then the markets will move a little bit we have two results from the g20 meeting and so on and so on it’s that’s why I think everybody is enjoying the fine weather and it’s not thinking about trading mini hands I think we will close the session for today because you see if nothing happens and if nothing happens we won’t don’t want to keep you there we have our sessions very often so we will have our next webinar take a look at the web page we have really on many webinars in English and in German language so we are we are always pleased when you join us when you will get in contact with us when you send us questions because so we get in touch with you and it’s always nice to us and as I

Whatever it is that you do to help adoption, for this week, you must dedicate yourself 100% to the cause. It's summertime, maybe host a Bitcoin BBQ, garden party, or any other sort of party. As July 4th falls in this week, for our American bitcoiners, maybe include Bitcoin in your independence day celebrations, as now you know what true independence is. Maybe shine a Bitcoin beacon light on your central bank, put up a Bitcoin billboard, or throw on your finest Bitcoin t shirt. Maybe set a goal to introduce 10 people to Bitcoin. Whatever it is you choose to do, make sure its fun, enjoyable, inclusive and not illegal. A few months ago I shared how I always offer my customers their change in Bitcoin in my taxi in Dublin, I'm still doing it and have introduced many more to Bitcoin since then.

Thanks to skyrocketing prices and rollercoaster dips, everyone and their dog are interested in learning how to buy and sell Bitcoin . As the most popular form of cryptocurrency ( and the blockchain technology that powers it), Bitcoin is now widely accepted around the world and has a growing number of applications . But before you can get into any of that, you need to first know where to go to purchase and store it.\nThere are a few steps you need to take to make your first purchase, but if you’re ready and willing to follow along, we’ll teach you how to buy Bitcoin in no time. Quick tips\nAlthough each step does take some consideration, these are the main points you need to think over when it comes to making your first Bitcoin purchase: Install an offline Bitcoin wallet and setup a strong password to protect it. Set up an account on Coinbase (and GDAX if you want additional control). Choose your preferred payment method. Buy some Bitcoin! Step 1: Find a good Bitcoin wallet\nDigital “wallets” are used to store Bitcoin until you are ready to spend them or exchange them for another currency. Wallets range in terms of features, platforms they can be used on, and security, so it’s important to choose one that works for you.\nTo get you started, your best bet is to use the wallet that’s automatically provided to you on our recommended exchange, Coinbase. However, it’s also a good idea to set up a wallet that’s not linked to an exchange as that way if the exchange ever goes down or becomes rammed with traffic, you still have ready access to your Bitcoin.\nHere are our recommended options:\nExodus An all-in-one offline application with support for a number of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Exodus is free to use, has built in shape-shift trading and some simple graphing tools to help you visualise your cryptocurrency portfolio.\nMycelium is a popular mobile wallet known for being compatible with more advanced tech, like Trezor hardware wallets (for maximum security) and Tor.\nFor a look at a few other of our favorite wallets, here’s a more in-depth guide to the best Bitcoin wallets .\nNote: Although an online wallet is fine for your first Bitcoin purchase, if you find yourself with a lot of valuable cryptocurrency because of trading or an upswing in value, make sure to store it in an offline “cold storage” wallet for maximum protection. Step 2: Choose the right Bitcoin trader\nThe best place to make your first Bitcoin purchase is on an exchange. There are a whole lot of exchanges out there, with varying performance. Some are less trustworthy than others and some can be quite limited, so it’s important to pick the right exchange to start with. We recommend using Coinbase , though there’s no harm in checking out the competition using a Bitcoin exchange comparison site .\nSigning up for a Coinbase account is easy, though you will need to provide some form of identification. That may involve sending a copy of your photo ID and potentially also sending a live image of your face using a webcam. These rules are important to follow as they allow the site(s) to comply with ‘know-your-customer’ regulations.\nAlthough Coinbase alone will allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin, it’s also worth signing up to its linked exchange platform, GDAX , which will give you greater control over your purchases.\nIf you would rather take a more direct route in buying Bitcoin, you can opt to use a peer to peer service, such as LocalBitcoin or BitQuick . They offer a wider array of payment options and let you purchase Bitcoin directly from a seller without the exchange middle man. That said, make sure to be safe if you plan to do a trade for cash in person. Step 3: Select your payment method\nExchanges accept a variety of payment options based on what they are willing to use. This is sort of a sore point for many exchanges, since some payment methods have been used to scam sellers for a quick buck in the past. Coinbase allows both bank account and credit or debit card transfers for payments and one payment solution must be linked to your account before you can make the trade. Paypal is not supported by Coinbase and with good reason .\nNote: Bitcoin ATMs allow you to exchange Bitcoin in compatible wallets for cash. These ATMs are available in a limited number of cities , but do provide an alternative to withdrawing money using an exchange. Again, most exchanges and online wallets will not deal directly with cash. Step 4: Buy some Bitcoin and store them in your wallet\nYou will notice that exchanges provide you with information on how many (or how much of a) Bitcoin you can buy for specific sums of money. However, due to its volatile nature, Bitcoin prices can vary dramatically by exchange and from moment to moment — especially lately . That means that even if you have a lot of money to burn, you’ll probably be buying a fraction of a Bitcoin. There’s nothing wrong with that and for most people is the route they’ll go down as few but the wealthy can afford more than that.\nTo make your first trade, input the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy in the provided field and click the buy button. On Coinbase or GDAX, this will be a basic “market” buy order, which will purchase Bitcoin at the best market rate. Alternatively, you can place a “limit” order, which lets you set a price you’re willing to pay for a certain amount and a trade will only happen if that amount shows up at that price.\nOnce you’re made your purchase, your new Bitcoin will be stored in your Coinbase wallet. You should then seek out the option to transfer these funds to the address of the Bitcoin wallet you have created that’s off the exchange. You will have to pay a small fee to do so, but that is part and parcel of Bitcoin transfers. Fortunately, the fees for such trades are far from their peak.\nImportant note: Bitcoin transfers can be a bit sporadic. Unlike other currency trades, when you buy Bitcoin funds. the transaction needs to be recorded in the blockchain and affirmed. This can take time, especially during busy trading hours. It’s not uncommon for a trade to take an hour or two to complete, so you may not want to immediately leap over to your account and start moving funds around. Step 5: Get ready to use it\nWhether you plan to ultimately sell your Bitcoin (hopefully at a profit) or use it to purchase something, be ready to do so at a moment’s notice. The way Bitcoin value fluctuates it’s important to have your end-game planned out early on. Be prepared by setting up a seller account now, or figure out how to buy what you want with it before you actually plan to. That way when the time comes, you’ll not have a panicked rush while everyone else is trying to do the same.\nFor a look at where you can spend your Bitcoin, here’s a list of compatible online stores . Always read reviews and fine print before making any purchase or exchange with your Bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/bitcoin-crash-10000/", "https://coinatmradar.com/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/topic/blockchain/", "https://localbitcoins.com/", "https://www.cryptocompare.com/exchanges/#/overview", "https://www.exodus.io/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-sell-bitcoin/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/bitcoin-exchange-loses-more-than-60-million-in-digital-heist/", "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Cold_storage", "http://spendbitcoins.com/", "https://www.bitquick.co/", "https://wallet.mycelium.com/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-buy-bitcoin-with-paypal/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/buy-with-bitcoin/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-bitcoin-wallets/", "https://www.coinbase.com/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-a-blockchain/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "tech bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T05:23:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c014be3d71c3a3f8580dbeaa0f6181a3657ada3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVUAwcQX.9h7A_rSrjeeF5Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Is the Bitcoin market going to collapse?", "title_full": "Is the Bitcoin market going to collapse?", "published": "2018-05-20T13:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.055, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c014be3d71c3a3f8580dbeaa0f6181a3657ada3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVUAwcQX.9h7A_rSrjeeF5Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EditorX", "published": "2018-05-20T13:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is the Bitcoin market going to collapse?", "text": "My opinion is that in time Bitcoin market share will keep reducing, as many other coins and tokens and platforms will keep surging.\nIn the long term, the blockchain technology is very disruptive.

Ideally, the bitcoin price is normally expressed as the exchange rate of the bitcoin in relation to other currencies. With an upsurge in the adoption and usage of this digital currency, the demand for bitcoins has significantly increased in the recent past.\nFactors that affect the price of Bitcoin include:\n1) Supply & Demand - At a basic level, the price movements of any cryptocurrency will be driven by its availability. The scarcer a digital coin is, the higher its price levels. In contrast, a virtual currency with an abundant supply will likely experience lower price levels.\n2)Mining Difficulty - In the case of proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin, the mining difficulty of a coin can also have a direct relationship with its price. A higher mining difficulty means that it is harder to mine an additional unit of a coin. This can have an impact on a coins perceived value, and subsequently its price, as increasing a coins supply will require more computing power to be used in the mining process.\n3)Utility - A key factor that will affect a cryptocurrencys price movement is its perceived utility. A virtual currency that possess no practical use will likely be viewed as having no value, which may be reflected with lower market price levels. For example, Ethers price movements can be attributed to its perceived practical utility, that being a users ability to build and launch their own decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform\n4)Market News - Market News can also affect a coins price movements. Positive or negative news reporting can be a heavy influencer of general market sentiment regarding a particular coin. Media reporting about a network hack for example is likely to drive prices down, whereas, coverage about a coins increasing adoption can result in positive market sentiment that drives a coins market price upward.\nHope this helps a little! Happy bitcoin-ing!!!\nThe most important factor that influence the price of Bitcoin is DEMAND of Bitcoin for sure. If the demand is more and the supply is less than Bitcoin will surely become more valuable.\nOther factors which also affect the price of Bitcoin is Bitcoin's status around the globe. Any favourable news can take the price of Bitcoin to new heights for sure.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T10:09:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31c688b3a6f38928cca4265363a98c3c3e413806", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf34xlMY2AsdYKUjrELcz8eNAYa8GDA51GHzW_HYPigooCUVUbPGgBa2FDyyD52eARSAAGpg7nJv4a", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "At the moment, 37.7% of bitcoin transaction are segwit and they are only paying 14% of total fees.

But that doesn’t mean mining has slowed down. Rather, the opposite has been happening, giving environmentalists (and anyone but the most adamant cryptobros) cause for concern.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware, and the outrageous, ever-rising energy costs needed to operate a bitcoin mining rig, the world’s Bitcoin network is expected to use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the end of 2018, according to new research and models . That’s one two-hundredth of all the electricity used on the planet. And that’s terrible.\nLet’s put that another way. According to that research, which is admittedly based on some imperfect assumptions and averages, the Bitcoin network currently uses about as much power as the entire country of Ireland (which uses 3.1 gigawatts) and is expected to grow to the same energy consumption level as Austria, which is currently at 8.2 gigawatts.\nThe world’s population is right around 7.6 billion people. If everyone used the same amount of energy (which they don’t but bear with me) that would put Bitcoin’s energy consumption — and toll on the environment — at the same level as that of 38 million people.\nNow, this certainly doesn’t mean that bitcoin should be cancelled. And while it seems like nothing can convince crypto fans that bitcoin is anything but the way of the future, these findings show just how much of an impact the cryptocurrency is having on the world. And not a “we’re gonna take back the financial markets and build a better tomorrow!” kind of impact. More of a tangible “oopsy-daisy, we’re accidentally scorching the planet” kind.\nIf cryptocurrencies are truly going to become the money of tomorrow, then we’ll absolutely need to grapple with the environmental damage caused by this major energy suck (assuming the price of Bitcoin continues to climb). Or, figure out how to mine more efficiently. Because again, in the next six months we may see Bitcoin using as much electricity as a major industrialized nation.\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

Izinkan saya seorang newbie di forum ini untuk berargumentasi berdasarkan sepengetahuan saya.\nSebelumnya mohon maaf atas sifat tread ini yang sempit, yakni diperuntukkan bagi member forum ini yang beragama Islam. Tread ini saya buat dengan maksud meluapkan ide/gagasan yang saya miliki serta mempunyai niat semoga ada senior-senior yang tergerak hatinya untuk memberikan merit kepada saya, karena setelah saya simpulkan untuk mendapatkan Merit diperlukan postingan yang berkualitas. Walaupun postingan ini tidak terjamin kualitasnya . Ya tidak apa-apa juga saya tidak rugi kok nulis postingan ini he he\nIslam adalah agama yang kompabilitasnya tidak terlekang oleh waktu dan zaman, tidak terbatas oleh cakupan wilayah, tidak terbagi menjadi beberapa golongan. Islam mengajarkan banyak hal yang dapat membuat kualitas hidup pemeluknya menjadi lebih baik. Sebagai muslim yang baik, tentunya harus juga mencerminkan perilaku yang benar-benar muslim, yakni orang yang menjalankan dengan benar segala tindakannya berdasarkan Alquran dan Sunnah Nabi Muhammad SAW. Salah satu aspek kehidupan yang diatur oleh Islam adalah ekonomi (muamalah).\nPada saat ini, muncul sebuah fenomena mata uang digital (Crypto-Currency) yang dapat dijadikan sebagai alat pembayaran, walaupun di Indonesia keberadaannya belum diakui sebagai mata uang. Salah satu crypto-currency yang merupakan penggagas serta nilai tukarnya tertinggi saat ini adalah Bitcoin yang pada forum ini juga agan-agan pasti sering bersentuhan dengannya . Proses mendapatkan Bitcoin tersebut bisa didapatkan dengan berbagai cara diantaranya investasi, trading, mining, dsb.\nDiantara berbagai hukum tentang bitcoin memang masih perdebatan diantara berbagai ulama. Namun, pada beberapa bulan silam, MUI mengeluarkan fatwa bahwa Bitcoin hukumnya mubah jika digunakan sebagai alat tukar bagi yang berkenan untuk menggunakannya dan mengakuinya, tetapi hukumnya haram jika dijadikan untuk investasi . Sementara itu, menurut Syekh Muhammad Al-Unbaby dan Habib Abdullah bin Abu bakar, uang digital serupa dengan fulus yang dicetak sehingga hukum bermuamalah dengannya adalah sah secara total. Oleh karena itu, mata uang digital wajib dikenakan zakat.\nBerdasarkan sumber di atas, kita meyakini bahwasannya Bitcoin dapat kita gunakan untuk jual beli. Kalau bisa sih, emang iya, jangan dijadikan sebagai investasi. #cmiiw. Dengan demikian, mari kita sama-sama untuk saling mengingatkan bahwasannya Bitcoin ini perlu dikeluarkan zakat. Agar harta dalam bentuk Bitcoin (crypto-currency) yang kita miliki dibersihkan. Mengenai perhitungan zakatnya saya belum tahu persis, belum sempet baca sumber yang kuat. Maklum saya masih awam yang hanya bisa saling sharing satu sama lain. Mudah-mudahan jika nanti sempat, saya akan membuat tulisan lagi mengenai perhitunngan zakatnya.\nKalau ada yang salah mohon koreksi gan, kita sama-sama belajar.\nRamadhannya semoga diberkahi, puasanya lancar.\nSekian dan terimakasih. Semoga bermanfaat.\nWassalamualaikum Wr Wb.\nsumber:\nhttp://www.nu.or.id/post/read/86225/hukum-transaksi-dengan-bitcoin\nhttp://khazanah.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-nusantara/18/01/14/p2iwco396-ini-pandangan-komisi-dakwah-mui-terkait-bitcoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://khazanah.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-nusantara/18/01/14/p2iwco396-ini-pandangan-komisi-dakwah-mui-terkait-bitcoin", "http://www.nu.or.id/post/read/86225/hukum-transaksi-dengan-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T11:56:13.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05c0ff117cabfdfbed6f6596302fddbc9c288e75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sv0IX19hoRSOZrx9Vuwx6mpPyUoIqlyuXFLLK_iW47Xup9cXDif4RQwVUB1SRaz1bQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Instead of spending $1000 to buy a new iphone every year, I am asking my friends to buy 0.1 bitcoin instead, to save their future.", "title_full": "Instead of spending $1000 to buy a new iphone every year, I am asking my friends to buy 0.1 bitcoin instead, to save their future.", "published": "2018-05-20T12:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05c0ff117cabfdfbed6f6596302fddbc9c288e75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sv0IX19hoRSOZrx9Vuwx6mpPyUoIqlyuXFLLK_iW47Xup9cXDif4RQwVUB1SRaz1bQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-20T12:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Instead of spending $1000 to buy a new iphone every year, I am asking my friends to buy 0.1 bitcoin instead, to save their future.", "text": "Instead of spending $1000 to buy a new iphone every year, I am asking my friends to buy 0.1 bitcoin instead, to save their future.\n/u/kadudu888\nSome listened, some didn't.\nEach one who listened is one person saved.\nsubmitted by /u/kadudu888\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T13:32:42.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fbdc32dc6c0bab7fd67f873056e4a045556bf23e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWPbI86qO0u153_65bIbZOI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "title_full": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-20T12:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbdc32dc6c0bab7fd67f873056e4a045556bf23e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWPbI86qO0u153_65bIbZOI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jihuny23", "published": "2018-05-20T12:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "text": "I think people who judge bitcoin, will not last for a long time without knowing its ability and understand that function, is a person who does not know bitcoin deeply.

Bcash implementation will be an addition to the already existing Bitprim, Parity, unlimited, Bitcoin ABC and XT.\nThey tweeted:\n“Announcing Bitcoin Cash coming to Purse! Plus: Launching now: ‘bcash’ – a bcoin (JS) implementation for Bitcoin Cash! AAANND we’re giving $10 #cashback to shoppers using BCH in the month of June! (with a prize pool for Earners!)”\nAccording to the official website of Purse, the update will go live by the end of May and is currently being tested. It further states:\n“once Bitcoin Cash goes live, users who missed the post-fork withdrawal period will be happy to see their balance restored.”\nHowever, they have also made it clear that ‘bcash’ is being introduced as an implementation and not a currency.\nWith a mission to ‘make crypto useful’, Purse allows its users to buy items at a discounted price from Amazon when the payment is made with Bitcoin. It has been popular for the same, since 2014. Majority of the developers at Purse believe in permission-less innovation and open source and contribute to it.\nOn 15th May, Andrew Lee, the CEO of Purse tweeted:\n“Purse has been paying everyone in Bitcoin since 2014. A few months ago, Purse changed the default salary from BTC to BCH to reduce payroll fees. Stay tuned for updates about native BCH.”\nEric L, a crypto enthusiast tweeted:\n“I knew it was only a matter of time Purse. I called this many many months ago! Glad to see you stuck to the only sensible solution despite the BTC trolls that might have disturbed you. I loved purse before but now I love it on a whole new level.

Genesis Mining has recently posted billboards in front of Buffetts office reminding him that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, and telling him that he may very well be wrong about bitcoin, as well.\nThe initiative has received a lot of support from the crypto community on social media. Genesis co-founder Marco Krohn posted on Twitter photos of the message to the investment guru with a short note saying: Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! \nEarlier this month, the American business magnate issued another warning in regards to bitcoin and the like. Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad ending, he said during the annual Berkshire Hathaways shareholder meeting, but he didnt stop there. If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, Id be glad to do it but I would never short a dimes worth, he said, concluding that bitcoin is probably rat poison squared. Needless to say, Buffetts comments provoked reactions and even inspired new business ideas. A tokenized marketplace called Ecoinmerce has announced the Rat Poison Squared clothing line. Т-shirts and hats are already offered online, but one can also order a mug with the winged phrase.\nmore about the article,\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-brief-saturday-warren-warned-by-billboards-coinbase-tempted-by-banking/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-brief-saturday-warren-warned-by-billboards-coinbase-tempted-by-banking/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:55:05.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad9b48e1aabcf480d564e1ea33beb978dee8520a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcOAXu8awfnOrGD774XHQLBjMf9ZkYCtFhuArXFmT6TR3gnSfcpw7gCnScD5WgKhjSFbSarVF1fNLEYyetOiVT0I-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Say hello if you have been banned from r/bitcoin", "title_full": "Say hello if you have been banned from r/bitcoin : btc", "published": "2018-05-20T11:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad9b48e1aabcf480d564e1ea33beb978dee8520a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcOAXu8awfnOrGD774XHQLBjMf9ZkYCtFhuArXFmT6TR3gnSfcpw7gCnScD5WgKhjSFbSarVF1fNLEYyetOiVT0I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mrtest001", "published": "2018-05-20T11:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Say hello if you have been banned from r/bitcoin", "text": "Hello.\n submitted by /u/mrtest001\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T07:48:39.195+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e81cd025dd6f35b653f19dc6f13634b3ecdd7ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZdc25oqgLPZQaZRXGlFnAQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Really?

The billionaire investor has consistently espoused the rhetoric that Bitcoin has no value. Recently, a crypto miner has taken to publicly calling out the Berkshire Hathaway chief for his negative comments. Warren Buffett Doesn’t Know It All\nAs far as Genesis Mining co-founder Marco Krohn is concerned, Warren Buffett is not an authority on Bitcoin. In fact, he doesn’t even know it all when it comes to investing. Despite a stellar investment career, the “Oracle of Omaha” hasn’t always called it correctly. By his own admission, Buffett regrets not immediately seeing the potential in Google and Amazon. He even only reluctantly invested in Apple after first dismissing the company’s stock for many years. With all of this in mind, Krohn is trying to show the public that Buffett’s rhetoric should be taken with a grain of salt.\nIn a tweet on May 16, Krohn showed photos of billboards reminding Buffett of his past investment mistakes. The sign reads:\nWarren: You said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you’re wrong about Bitcoin.\nWhat makes the campaign even more profound is that the billboard is right outside Buffett’s office in Omaha. It is a not too subtle diss to an individual who has spread much vitriol and FUD about Bitcoin. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO recently called the digital currency “ rat poison .” Many in the cryptocurrency community have disagreed with Buffett with some even going as far as saying that he doesn’t know anything about bitcoin. Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)\n— Marco Krohn (@mkrohn5) May 16, 2018 Genesis Mining Crypto Awareness Campaign\nThe Buffett-bashing billboard is part of a larger Bitcoin awareness campaign organized by the mining giant. The company, which also owns one of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland, is known for such public rebukes of crypto critics. During the just concluded Consensus conference in New York, the company organized a mock protest under the aegis of “Bankers Against Blockchain.” The rally was to enlighten people on what could become a reality in a few years’ time. The parody demonstration also aimed digs at people like Jamie Dimon and the Bitcoin bubble brigade.\nThe company has also come down hard on negative journalistic sentiments, especially those platforms fond of posting Bitcoin obituary articles. Apart from going up against critics, the campaign also strives to educate people about the practical applications of Bitcoin, especially in remittance. Part of the campaign’s mantra is that it shouldn’t cost money to send money. Thus.

The billionaire investor has consistently espoused the rhetoric that Bitcoin has no value. Recently, a crypto miner has taken to publicly calling out the Berkshire Hathaway chief for his negative comments.\nWarren Buffett Doesn’t Know It All As far as Genesis Mining co-founder Marco Krohn is concerned, Warren Buffett is not an authority on Bitcoin. In fact, he doesn’t even know it all when it comes to investing. Despite a stellar investment career, the “Oracle of Omaha” hasn’t always called it correctly. By his own admission, Buffett regrets not immediately seeing the potential in Google and Amazon. He even only reluctantly invested in Apple after first dismissing the company’s stock for many years. With all of this in mind, Krohn is trying to show the public that Buffett’s rhetoric should be taken with a grain of salt.\nIn a tweet on May 16, Krohn showed photos of billboards reminding Buffett of his past investment mistakes. The sign reads:\nWarren: You said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you’re wrong about Bitcoin.\nWhat makes the campaign even more profound is that the billboard is right outside Buffett’s office in Omaha. It is a not too subtle diss to an individual who has spread much vitriol and FUD about Bitcoin. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO recently called the digital currency “ rat poison .” Many in the cryptocurrency community have disagreed with Buffett with some even going as far as saying that he doesn’t know anything about bitcoin.\nSome new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)\n#GenesisMining #Bitcoin #BitcoinAwareness pic.twitter.com/MxuKLwRS8L\n— Marco Krohn (@mkrohn5) May 16, 2018\nGenesis Mining Crypto Awareness Campaign The Buffett-bashing billboard is part of a larger Bitcoin awareness campaign organized by the mining giant. The company, which also owns one of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland, is known for such public rebukes of crypto critics. During the just concluded Consensus conference in New York, the company organized a mock protest under the aegis of “Bankers Against Blockchain.” The rally was to enlighten people on what could become a reality in a few years’ time. The parody demonstration also aimed digs at people like Jamie Dimon and the Bitcoin bubble brigade.\nThe company has also come down hard on negative journalistic sentiments, especially those platforms fond of posting Bitcoin obituary articles. Apart from going up against critics, the campaign also strives to educate people about the practical applications of Bitcoin, especially in remittance. Part of the campaign’s mantra is that it shouldn’t cost money to send money. Thus. They regularly tell people that they can send money for free using Bitcoin rather than via remittance platforms like Western Union who charge high fees.\nShould crypto critics be given a taste of their own medicine?
