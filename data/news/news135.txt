It walled off capital from fleeing the system.\nAnd the response was a group of folks applied the teachings of Austrian Economics and Ludwig von Mises’ Regression Theorem to create a digital asset which became less resistant to fraud the more it was adopted.\nThe result was Bitcoin.\nBitcoin was a catastrophic mutation. A thing born out of necessity to free human beings from a central issuing authority of new monetary units. That relationship needs to be broken if we are going to free ourselves from the cycle of tyranny of the few at the expense of the many.\nThis isn’t to say that Bitcoin itself is the end of the story. No, in fact, it’s simply the beginning of the next story in human development. But it shows us where we are headed. What Goes Around …\nThe ebb and flow of the human generational cycle and its relationship to natural cycles is at the heart of the economic cycle with its booms and busts. They create the interplay of how the rate of wealth generation proceeds.\nIt’s not possible to end the business cycle, like the Utopian Marxists and their economic brethren the Keynesians believe.\nThe business cycle is tied to forces far beyond the control of any one person.\nThe central control of money is an accelerant of both sides of the economic cycle, the boom and the bust.\nExcess credit creation, an inevitability during boom times, without underlying assets pull forward production from the future. It does this by cheating the slower formation of capital through industry and savings.\nThe risk associated with that credit is almost certain to be under-priced via the loan’s interest rate because the lender didn’t earn the money it is lending.\nThe result is a high probability that the loan will not be repaid as the project was unsupported by the pool of real savings within the economy. Gene Callahan’s excellent book, “ Economics for Real People ” covers this brilliantly in the first few chapters.\nExcess credit creation thanks to the imperfect knowledge of all economic actors accelerates the boom and exacerbates the subsequent bust as the credit money is destroyed and the assets it was supporting fall in price. Misaligned Incentives\nCentralized money issuers have a vested interest in selling more monetary units. Because they make their wealth on the arbitrage between the price of what they buy now versus the higher price later.\nThey institutionalize the underpricing of capital risk by issuing money at lower interest rates than the economy can support. The result is a shift of the demand for money farther out in time because the most interest rate sensitive projects are the most capital intensive with the longest time horizons to completion.\nThis not only subsidizes uneconomic capital spending building roads to ghost cities but also crowds out investment in the projects the society actually needed because that capital was bid away from those projects.\nOnce the pool of real savings is exhausted because borrowers can’t generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the loans the whole system starts to collapse. Borrowers miss payments, the banks get caught short of cash and liquidations and bankruptcies rise.\nThe banks are leveraged up, having lent up to ten times the amount of money they have in their ‘vaults.’ Once the borrowers stop paying, the savers have to be paid their part of the interest on the loan and the bank runs out of cash.\nWelcome to a bank run. The Lobster Trap\nInflation is the result of more money chasing the same number of goods. And prices are a reflection of the knowledge of the two participants in the transaction. There is a mismatch between the two if there is a central issuer of new currency.\nFor example, say I’m a central banker who whips up $1000 for my weekly lunch tab. I know that $1000 will inflate prices later. New money gets spent at today’s prices because the restaurant owner doesn’t know where the money came from.\nHe just knows business is good and that I buy the most expensive lunches he offers. This gives him the false signal to up the price of that dish, say lobster. He knows he can then outbid his competition for lobsters, driving up the price.\nI’ll always pay the new, higher market price for the lobster.\nBecause why the heck not? I’m printing money out of ‘thin air’ and sticking taxpayers with the bill.\nThis form of income, unearned through honest labor, is called rent.\nAnd so on. With each transaction the new money raises prices along the way. The closer you are to the issuer of the new currency, the more of the total arbitrage between the original price and the final higher price you receive.\nThis is why wealth inequality is accelerating in the Age of Central Banking at an exponential rate.\nAs the central banker pay off Congress, the banks, the lawyers, the media and everyone else with my new money first to ensure I can continue foisting the costs of my life off on the taxpayers.\nThe old system was simply debasing the coinage by cutting down the amount of gold or silver in the coins. The modern system is to issue new money units as debt against someone else’s labor, i.e. the taxpayers.\nBitcoin and the blockchain say nuts to all that. They say new money units should be divorced from human desires and their capacity for corruption. Let’s have math govern that and let the humans figure out how to earn wealth through the system itself. Tying Risk Down\nSovereign consumers are always looking for ways to grind out arbitrage by bidding as little as possible for what they buy. Enforcers of control are always looking to earn rent by keeping prices higher than consumers want.\nBankers love inflation, consumers love deflation.\nBitcoin, alongside gold, is the ultimate weapon against the rent-seekers because its supply is not governed by humans. This small difference changes everything. There is certainty as to what the supply of money will be tomorrow or next week.\nAnd as such demand for it can be more predictably forecast by market actors. There is no guess work as to what the central bankers are going to do at the next meeting. There are no gonzo gold deposits that could radically change the supply of it on the horizon.\nWhile market forces guide the hands of the central bankers and the gold miners to some extent, nothing is changing how many Bitcoins will be available tomorrow. Yes, there is loss due to attrition and small, uneconomical balances lying around in wallets all over the world. But, there is a known maximum of coins, governed by math, that removes the human element from money creation.\nAnd because of that eventually Bitcoin, or some other suitable cryptocurrency or basket thereof, will form the reserve asset pool against which all other assets are measured. Because that stability of supply and its growth will grind out opportunities to collect rent created by the uncertainty and unfairness of the current system.\nIt simply costs too much to regulate dollars, euros, etc. Those lowered costs will now be passed to consumers who retain ownership over the value of their money.\nBitcoin returns sovereignty back to the consumer, the rights-holder, which is exactly where it belongs. It distributes (in theory) the ownership of the transaction network and pays them to maintain it. Consumers are the ones who have money to convert into goods. They should be the sole arbiters of their money’s exchange rate, not a President, Board of Directors or Banker.\nIf the market needs more money in the short term it will create it. Banks can issue credit based on its Bitcoin balances. But, they will be constrained in how they do this because no Federal Reserve stands behind them ready to bail them out.\nSo, be good at risk assessment or be driven out of business.\nHard forks and other blockchains can create new cheaper currency units and keep the owners of the older network honest through competition and potentially better service, e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Litecoin, etc. And So it Begins…\nAnd that’s why consumers will over time choose to do business in cryptocurrencies over debt-based ones. The value of their money is based on the operational excellence of the owners of the network not the needs of corrupt bankers and politicians.\nThe miners/witnesses/notaries update and improve it to meet consumers’ needs rather than sitting behind a wall of laws and dictating that inflation is too low and dumping a bunch of euros on the market, devaluing your wages and your savings.\nThe costs of paying the network operators will be regulated by the market far more efficiently than the current system. And those cost advantages will translate up and down the financial services industry to steal market share from traditional banks over time.\nThat arbitrage is what is fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency markets now. We’ll still see all the same things that happen today happen in a world governed by cryptocurrencies – bank runs, bad loans, too much or little credit, etc.\nBut all of those things will not be institutionalized and protected by laws. They will be isolated and far better contained as long as they are allowed to develop as companies free from government interference. The discipline of a crowded market will inspire innovation in risk management.\nAs we approach the moment in history when the confidence we have in central banks will be tested to the extreme, the timing of cryptocurrency adolescence couldn’t be better. When the monetary system seizes up and people look for new solutions the ‘cryptos’ will be there to keep things flowing.\nThose that are have cryptos in their portfolio of assets now are holding them as savings, hedging against this very risk. And in the process they are becoming their own central bank holding reserves to protect their wealth unwittingly ushering in the inevitable.\n* * *\nTo support more work like this and get access to exclusive commentary, stock picks and analysis tailored to your needs, join my more than 100 Patrons on Patreon and see if I have what it takes to help you navigate a world going slowly mad.

Hougan hinges his prediction on the cryptocurrency becoming an actual store of value and the blockchain permeating several facets of human life.\nIs Bitcoin a Store of Value? Finding a consensus on any argument related to Bitcoin is almost a futile effort at this point. There's the bubble argument , the economic definition argument, and of course, the store of value argument. Matt Hougan, in a recent op-ed for Forbes , examines the store of value debate for Bitcoin, drawing some interesting parallels with gold.\nRight from inception, the virtual currency has been compared with gold. Some proponents are even in the habit of calling the crypto \" digital gold .\" Critics, however, dispute this idea, saying that the cryptocurrency cannot be compared to gold because it is highly volatile and, as such, cannot be a store of value.\nOne of the most basic definitions of a store of value is an asset that is both tradable and can be stored for future use. By this definition, a store of value must maintain some stability over a reasonable period. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, no arguments there. However, is the volatility exhibited by the number one crypto a misnomer in the finance world? It turns out the answer is no, and Hougan provides hard evidence.\nA Little Bit of History Featuring the Post-1971 Gold Market Today, gold is not only solid based on its physical form, but as an asset, it maintains some level of price rigidity. However, it wasn't always so. In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon dropped the gold standard for the USD. The price of gold and the value of the dollar was no longer tethered together. What happened next? Well, the table below gives an idea of the wild volatility in prices of gold in the decade following 1971.\nToday's crypto critics would be bellowing that gold isn't a store of value if they examined these figures. However, today, it is universally accepted that the precious metal is indeed a store of value. So, what has changed? The answer isn't utility as some might point out. Gold has some industrial application use cases but that it is not enough to justify its current price. According to Hougan:\n[Gold] is worth $1,300 per ounce because people are willing to pay $1300 per ounce for it as a store of wealth.\nBitcoin Mirrors Post-1971 Gold Bitcoin is less than a decade old, which means it isn't yet a fully formed asset. Hougan believes that expecting the cryptocurrency to behave like a fully matured asset is an argument that lacks economic merit. According to the cryptoanalyst, Bitcoin is passing through the two-stage process of rapid appreciation and declining volatility over time.\n2017 saw a parabolic rise in prices that seem to have plateaued in 2018. The Bitcoin volatility, while still considerably high, is declining over time. This pattern exhibited by the number one crypto bears striking similarities to gold after 1971.\nSpeculative Investment Will Give Way to Real World Use If Bitcoin follows the pattern set by gold, then it is well on its way to establishing itself as a store of value . Right now, the crypto is held as a speculative investment, but within the next decade, as blockchain utility increases, Bitcoin will become an even more significant part of global finance. The current market capitalization for the virtual currency is $130 billion , which is approximately two percent of the $7.5 trillion gold market cap.\nIn ten years, Bitcoin could comfortably hold 10 percent of the value of gold, which would mean a conservative price estimate of $40,000. A lot of this depends on how quickly real-world utility applications can be implemented for the cryptocurrency and the assumption that it continues on a similar trajectory to gold.\nDo you agree with the argument that Bitcoin is like gold, and as such, a store of value? Will an increase in real-world utility drive the price of Bitcoin higher?

There is a good chance that you have heard about bitcoin. A smaller chance that you know litecoin or dogecoin. If you want to know the technical side or economic cryptocurrency - use google. For the needs of my retirement, it is enough to know that cryptocurrencies act as cash in a modern version. They have their value (they are listed on the stock exchanges, they have their course), they can be safely stored, they can be sent immediately to any distance, practically free of charge and - with a little effort - they are anonymous. And they are today at the initial stage of development. Everyone who touches them is still an early employer, and this means that - with a high probability - a long-term investment in cryptocurrencies will be very profitable. I chose 4 cryptocurrencies for my retirement basket and gave them percentages indicating their presence in the basket. When making my choice, I based my own - already several years - experience in the cryptocurrency industry, the capitalization value of a given cryptocurrency (market cap) and the features that distinguish it from other coins on the market. And so I chose:\nHow much do I put aside? I did not want to set any fixed amount. Because you know - inflation, fluctuations in financial markets, etc. ...

We're now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.\nFor instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system. Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene — such as digital identity verification fintechs — as new opportunities for innovation are discovered.\nSignificantly, incumbents are responding more proactively to the rising influence of fintech by making updates to their consumer-facing channels, back-end systems, and overall business operations. Most are realizing that the best way to adapt is to work alongside the fintechs that are transforming the financial services environment, either by partnering with them or acquiring the startups entirely. As fintech's power grows, incumbents will have no choice but to change in order to stay relevant and competitive. All around, fintech is becoming embedded in mainstream finance.\n , Business Insider's premium research service, has written the definitive Fintech Ecosystem report that looks at the shifts in the broader environment that fintechs operate in, including funding patterns and regulatory trends; examines the adaptations that some of fintech's biggest subsegments have had to make to secure a foothold in the financial services system; and discusses how the continued rise of the fintech industry is pressuring incumbents to make fundamental changes to their business models and roles. It ends by assessing what a global economy increasingly influenced by innovative fintechs will look like.\nHere are some key The fintech industry is far more than a group of digitally native, consumer-centric startups, although they are, in many ways, becoming the new face of financial services. It's increasingly clear that fintech no longer stands apart from financial services proper, and is morphing into an integral part of the financial system. To secure their position in the mainstream economy, some of the main fintech subsegments have had to adjust their business models. These include neobanks, robo-advisors, and alt lenders. Other fintech categories, meanwhile, have instead found that current conditions are well suited to their original models, and are seeing largely smooth sailing, like regtechs, insurtechs, and payments fintechs. Innovation and dynamism is still alive in fintech too, with new categories still emerging. The rising influence of fintechs is having a dramatic effect on incumbents, from banks to insurers to wealth managers, pushing them to respond proactively to stay relevant. Incumbents are reacting to changes wrought by fintechs on three key fronts: the front end, the back end, and in their core business operations. As such, incumbents and fintechs are converging on a digital middle ground. As this happens, the fintech industry is on the cusp of becoming an integral component of the broader financial services ecosystem. But it will likely first have to go through a complete credit cycle, and survive an economic downturn like the one that set the stage for its arrival in 2008, for this to happen.\n how the environment in which the fintech industry operates is changing, and what that means for the digitization of financial services. Gives an overview of the main subsegments within the global fintech industry, and discusses which categories have had to adapt to survive, which have reaped benefits from their original game plans, and which new segments have come to the fore in the past twelve months. Outlines the adaptations that incumbent financial institutions have begun making to adjust to an economy that's inevitably shifting to digital, and in which tech-savvy fintechs are increasingly setting the standards.

Rooting out Bad Actors in ICO Market Ferguson’s comments were said at a seminar recently held by the Bank of England, where he shared his support for Bitcoin, but spoke out against the associated, often unregulated fundraising method of ICOs. “I wish I had a Bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said according to Quartz . “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.” ICOs have been increasingly making headlines — especially following the astronomic rise in the value of cryptocurrencies that was seen toward the end of 2017. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) released an analysis of the fundraising method , but Ferguson believes the organization might just be scratching the surface. ICO Red Flags To research the industry, the WSJ combed the white papers — documents outlining the specifics of a company’s ICO — of 1,450 ICOs, finding 271 ‘red flags.’ These red flags include things like celebrity endorsements, promises of exceptionally high returns, and (false) claims of regulatory compliance.\nOf the projects that the WSJ singled out as suspicious, most were uncovered because of plagiarized texts, images of team members and/or investors taken from stock photography banks. In 111 cases, entire sections of company white papers were simply copied and pasted from competitors websites. Even more scary is that, put together, the 271 ICOs identified as having red flags they have garnered a combined sum of over $1 billion from investors. This is according to a review of company statements and online transaction records performed by the WSJ. Regulators Strike Back While some of the projects are still raising money, others have shut down or have been frozen by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal regulatory authority that has been tasked with investigating ICOs and other potentially fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency space. These moves by U.S. regulators come less than a week after the SEC created their own fake ICO website , which was developed in attempts to show potential investors the obvious signs of ICO scams. On the site , HoweyCoin — which takes its name from the 1946 four-part Howey test, created to determine what qualifies as a security — is presented as a way to invest in the luxury travel market. But it’s all a ruse, created to show potential investors just how easy it can be to fall victim to such scams. The WSJ is not alone in its scrutiny of ICOs. In fact, other reports signal even deeper problems in the market. For example, according to news organization Izvestia, who cited the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, half of the $300 million raised by ICOs in Russia in 2017 were pyramid schemes. Another source, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, was asked what the percentage of ICO fraud is, to which he answered: ‘Somewhere north of 50?’ While the numbers here are clearly hard to properly grasp, and although they may vary, they’re still indicative of a large problem. Moving forward, if regulators want retail investors to stop being scammed by unregulated schemes, they have to demonstrate the value of oversight, promote fairness, and emphasize the common adage that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is.

Look at These 3 Companies First", "text": " About to Buy Bitcoin? Look at These 3 Companies First\nBitcoin was a joyride for early investors, as the cryptocurrency surged from less than $100 earlier in the decade to more than $19,000 last December. However, the digital coin has fallen to around $7,500 since then as the hype and speculation around it seem to have peaked. At the same time, Google searches for “bitcoin” have also dropped sharply since December.\nWhile crypto fans may be unfazed, the majority of the market seems to have moved on. If you’re considering buying bitcoin for the high upside potential it exhibited last year, you may be better off with this group of stocks, which all have the potential to deliver big returns. Keep reading to see why our panel of Motley Fool investors recommendPayPal(NASDAQ:PYPL),Yelp(NYSE:YELP), and Trivago(NASDAQ:TRVG).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe pioneer in online payments\nLeo Sun (PayPal): PayPal, which was spun off of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015, popularized digital payments long before bitcoin became relevant. Unlike its industry peer Square (NYSE:SQ), PayPal refuses to add bitcoin transactions to its platform, saying that volatile prices make bitcoin unsuitable for payments.\nPayPal’s core business is rapidly growing. It’s posted double-digit sales growth every quarter since its spinoff, and analysts expect revenue to rise 17% this year (despite eBay’s decision to gradually part ways with PayPal by 2023). Its earnings are expected to rise 23% this year.\nLast quarter, PayPal’s revenue rose 24% annually, while its total payments volume (TPV) rose 27% to $132 billion on a constant currency basis — supported by 30% growth in merchant services TPV, 50% growth in peer-to-peer payments (thanks to its subsidiary Venmo), and 52% growth in mobile payment volumes.\nIts total number of transactions climbed 25% to 2.2 billion, as its total number of transactions per active account rose 8% to 34.7 over the past 12 months. Its new active accounts rose 35% annually. Those robust growth figures indicate that PayPal continues to gain steam as an international digital payments platform — which is now available in 202 countries and 25 currencies. PayPal also recently acquired Square’s rival iZettle for $2.2 billion to expand its reach into mobile point-of-sale systems.\nPayPal’s stock isn’t cheap at 35 times this year’s earnings. But it’s arguably a smarter play on a cashless and cardless future than bitcoin.\nTake advantage of Yelp’s pullback\nSteve Symington (Yelp): Bitcoin investors are all too familiar with unexpected pullbacks. So if you’re considering buying some of the popular cryptocurrency, you might appreciate taking a look at Yelp instead. When Yelp announced strong quarterly resultsearlier this month — posting higher-than-expected revenue and narrowing its per-share losses — it seemed strange at first to see shares of the local business-review website fall almost 8% in response.\nBut more important to Wall Street was the underlying source of that quarterly beat. While Yelp’s impressive results were driven by accelerating advertising revenue growth — ad sales climbed 20% year over year to $214 million, comprising the vast majority of its total revenue — that acceleration came as a result of the company’s adoption of non-term advertising contracts. Put simply, Wall Street wants to see whether newer advertisers will stick around, especially those that are trying Yelp for the first time precisely because of those more flexible contracts.\nTo be fair, Yelp’s co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman admitted during this quarter’s call that the company is going “through this change with a bit of caution about what we may see in the coming months.” But Yelp management also insisted the move is a concerted effort, preceded by nearly two years of testing, followed by a broader ramp up in the new contracts that began in the third quarter of 2017.\nTo that end, Yelp was comfortable enough with the sustainability of this shift to modestly increase its full-year guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Alas, the market would have none of it.\nBut if Yelp can prove to investors that its accelerated ad growth is good for more than just a single quarter’s outperformance, I think the stock will soar.\nA promising turnaround candidate\nJeremy Bowman (Trivago):Like bitcoin, Trivago shares have also tumbled in recent months. After the stock surged following its IPO in December 2016 as it was spun off fromExpedia, it’s now given up more than 80% since last July.\nThat decline has come largely due to Booking Holdings’ decision to scale back on advertising on the platform, focusing on profitability rather than market share, which had the effect of making Trivago’s revenue decline 3% year over year in the first quarter as comps were unfavorable, with Booking still on the platform a year ago.\nThe hotel-booking specialist is now projecting flat revenue for the year. However, the company should return to growth as it laps the issues with Booking Holdings, and it expects revenue to increase in the second half of the year.\nThe online travel industry is still growing steadily, and Allied Market Research projects it will grow at a compound annual rate of 11.1% from 2016 to 2022. Trivago’s exclusive focus on hotels should give it an advantage over more-diversified platforms, and as consumer awareness of the platform improves, it should outgrow the overall industry.\nAt this point, the stock looks oversold, as the current weakness is temporary. The stock could easily double from here once revenue growth accelerates again. This entry was posted in Best Stocks on by admin .

Here are 5 ways to short it", "text": "Don’t believe in Bitcoin? Here are 5 ways to short it L In this article, you will be introduced to the five easiest ways to short bitcoin if you want to bet on an upcoming price decline.\nOn May 7, Bill Gates proclaimed on CNBC's Squawk Box’ that he “would short [bitcoin] if there was an easy way to do it,\" as he considers bitcoin to be “kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment”. This statement is somewhat surprising as there are actually several ways bitcoin bears can short the digital currency. 1. Shorting bitcoin futures on CME/CBOE\nThe easiest way for institutional investors to short bitcoin is to sell bitcoin futures on the CME and CBOE . Futures are standardized exchange-traded financial derivatives that obligate an investor to buy or sell an underlying asset, such as a stock index, a commodity or a currency, at a predefined price and date in the future.\nIn other words, futures contracts enable investors to bet on the price increase or price decline of an asset without having to own it. Bitcoin futures contracts, on both the CME and CBOE, for example, are cash for delivery, which means that once the contract has matured or is closed out no “physical” bitcoins exchange hands. Instead, only the profit or loss of the trade is exchanged in US dollars. Interestingly, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggests that the Q1/2018 bitcoin price correction was partly due to the introduction of bitcoin futures on the CME and CBOE.\nThe report stated: \"Before December 2017, there was no market for bitcoin derivatives. This meant that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline in bitcoin price. [...] With the introduction of bitcoin futures, pessimists could bet on a bitcoin price decline [...]. They could sell a promise to deliver a bitcoin in a month’s time at a lower price than the current spot price and hope to buy a bitcoin during the month at an even lower price to make a profit.\nThe new investment opportunity led to a fall in demand in the spot bitcoin market and therefore a drop in price. With falling prices, pessimists started to make money on their bets, fueling further short selling and further downward pressure on prices.” 2. Shorting bitcoin CFDs on retail brokerages If you are a retail investor and do not have an account with a broker that supports CME/CBOE bitcoin futures contracts, you can also easily short bitcoin using an online CFD broker such as eToro , AvaTrade or Plus500 .\nCFDs (contracts for difference) function effectively the same way as futures contracts but are tailored towards retail investors. Using CFDs, investors can bet on a price increase or decrease of an underlying asset without having to own it physically. Furthermore, since CFDs are leveraged products, investors can go long or short bitcoin using margin . That means, investors only have to put down a percentage of the total amount of the trade in order to open a position. This allows investors to magnify their returns if their bet pays off but also carries increased risk as losses are also magnified if the price moves in the other direction. 3. Shorting bitcoin tracker funds European institutional and retail investors also have the option to short bitcoin using bitcoin exchange-traded notes. Currently, bitcoin ETNs can be found on the Stockholm-based Nasdaq OMX exchange and come with either EUR or USD denomination.\nAlternatively, if you are an accredited or an institutional investor in the U.S., you could also short the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) .\nHaving said that, bitcoin tracker funds usually trade at a premium to bitcoin, so shorting tracker funds may not be as effective as shorting using futures or CFDs for example. 4. Short selling on cryptocurrency exchanges\nFor more advanced crypto asset investors who are comfortable trading on digital asset exchanges, there are several platforms that offer “physical” bitcoin short selling on margin. Poloniex, Kraken, GDAX, and Bitfinex are examples of popular exchanges that enable their users to short bitcoin.\nShorting bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges functions in the same way as shorting bitcoin using CFDs — with the key difference being that you receive your profits in BTC as opposed to USD.\nWhen short selling bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange, an investor is selling bitcoin they do not own. To do that, investors can borrow bitcoin from margin lenders on the exchange for the duration of the open position. Once investors close out their bitcoin short, they gain or lose the difference from where they sold and where they are buying back minus the margin lending fee, which differs from exchange to exchange.\nExperienced cryptocurrency traders tend to prefer to short bitcoin on dedicated crypto asset exchanges. However, for investors who prefer to trade regulated financial products and are happy to receive their profits in fiat currency, bitcoin futures or CFD would be the better option. 5. Buying bitcoin put options\nFinally, bitcoin bears who are comfortable dealing in more complex derivatives also have the option to buy bitcoin put options as a way to bet on a bitcoin price decline. Options are financial derivatives that give an investor the right but not the obligation to purchase a specific asset at a predefined price on a specific date. Call options give investors the right to buy the asset, while put options give investors the right to sell the asset.\nOptions are most commonly used for hedging in the commodity and currency markets by large corporations. However, speculators can also use them to bet on their market views.\nFor example, if you believe the price of bitcoin will collapse in the summer of 2018, you could purchase a three-month bitcoin put option on LedgerX with a strike price of $5,000. Should the price of bitcoin collapse to trade below the strike price at maturity, your put option is “in the money” and you will make a trading profit. Should the price remain higher, you simply lose the option premium (i.e. the fee you paid for the option).\nHence, while options are definitely for more advanced investors, they offer a low-cost alternative for betting on a bitcoin price collapse.\nWhether Bill Gates will actually put his money where his mouth is and short the world’s leading digital currency remains to be seen, but if he really wanted to, he could.

A Guide To Digital Forex", "text": "by Gita Kushner on 6 minutes ago 3 views This venture goals to supply normal, secure good contracts and tools to create crowdsales for Ethereum blockchain. ICOs differ ico.echat.io by how the tokens are priced. Ethereum makes use of the immutable nature of blockchain and applies it to sensible contracts. Ethereum unleashed the ability of good contracts. For example, echat KoCurrency is a cryptocurrency price prediction platform where customers are required to pledge intelligence on intelligence contracts utilizing the platform's internal tokens. Some folks want to purchase a cool product for a cheaper price than its closing MSRP, for instance, whereas others have a real interest in seeing an organization succeed. However, some ICOs contain the alternate of fiat money as properly. Now ICOs scare away increasingly more people. Some of our token corporations will release tokens anynote.co over time to continue to supply tokens to the customers. Fondo: If you happen to do it in the U.S., you'll be able to nonetheless have your operations right here, and basically you possibly can have some people right here, however the primary pockets, primarily — the entity receiving the cash — would be in the Cayman Islands. SM: For the most part, they do. Generally, token sales involve dollars or different fiat currencies. With a view to have your tokens distributed to your private pockets, you will want to specify the deal with of your ERC20-compatible pockets. Most importantly do not use an trade wallet to obtain tokens. After you purchase ICO coins, it is advisable to make use of chilly wallet (offline) storage to carry the cryptographic data essential to money in echat for Investing on tokens. One of the simplest ways to protect your self towards fraudulent ICOs is to conduct research on the holder, checking to see if the corporate is registered and if there's correct identifying data. You will then obtain your tokens as soon because the sale ends. At the moment, however, most ICOs aren't promoting a coin designed for use as a general function forex, however quite a token related to a selected app, undertaking or enterprise. Here's the most important advantage of an ICO, nonetheless: in 2014, Ethereum sold cash via its ICO at a worth echat starting from $zero.30 to $0.forty per token. Then you definately had plenty of other milestone token gross sales, akin to Ethereum in 2014, then the DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Group, which was constructed on the Ethereum blockchain and that saved and transmitted Ether and Ethereum-based mostly belongings and that raised the equivalent of $one hundred fifty million final yr. Bitcoin was supreme on the time because it was the only blockchain with billions of dollars in cryptocurrency capital. So it is smart that every one token made on an Ethereum contract shall be registered on an open database clear for everyone to see. In the event you loved this post as well as you would want to receive more info concerning investing early chart kindly go to our site. There are a total 1,000,000,000 PROPS tokens being created, with 200,000,000 available during main ICO. Also referred to as a crowdsale\", an ICO is when a company releases its personal cryptocurrency with the aim of funding. An ICO, or preliminary coin providing, is a new phenomenon that has emerged from crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, and blockchain applied sciences. Think about this, if everybody designed their own tokens giving it their very own unique twist, it is going to be an absolute horror present to avoid wasting them in a pockets. This reflects a larger dynamic of ICOs, which is that they are almost completely utilized by technology initiatives — and principally blockchain-based tasks, at that. A shocking $1.1 billion has been raised in 89 ICOs to this point this year, 10 occasions as much as in all of 2016, and not less than 110 extra are planned this 12 months. During an ICO, companies often trade their cryptocurrency for Bitcoins. An Preliminary Coin Providing (ICO) for cryptocurrency is like an Initial Worth Providing (IPO) on the stock market, however as an alternative of buying stock in an organization you purchase digital cash. On the identical time, the amount raised by successful gross sales can be growing (see Coinist's greatest ICOs of all time graph). However it was with Ethereum in 2014 that the framework of the ICO and blockchain modified. But before we go forward and learn the way one can concern tokens for their undertaking, we must understand what a wise contract\" is. That is the principle topic for this put up in spite of everything. That is, depending on how a lot reserve the contract has excellent, it is going to robotically offer a price for the X tokens. The previous point was that Bancor makes use of its reserves to figure out where the market is, and units a worth accordingly. As long as the corporate behind the ICO does not misrepresent their coin or token as a monetary safety, and as long as traders comply with any and all native laws of their very own country concerning reporting of revenue, it's perfectly legal for everyone concerned. If the price goes to be performing some ups and downs around a single imply value, Bancor may also help facilitate trades by appearing as a market maker. All too often, whereas going via a token sale agreement, it's possible you'll discover out that an organization's investors usually are not really traders, and instead of providing corporate rights to ICO (crowdsale) participants, the tokens entitle them to hitch a undertaking (or a system). The first step in figuring out whether tokens make sense in your challenge or not relies upon upon what your undertaking's goal is and is there a approach that it may be tokenised.\" As discussed above, tokens aren't simply the forex used in the network, but they are a unit of the business mannequin on which the community is built on. It's known as ether, and we are able to use it no matter which token pairs we wish to trade, because those very tokens are, by definition, implemented on top of Ethereum and have been purchased with ether in the first place. You too can accumulate these tokens over time, as a guess that with more enterprise demand for storage capacity, the coins will turn into extra precious, after which you can sell your tokens to another person who needs to buy cupboard space.

The day before Bitcoin believers around the world celebrated the first Bitcoin transaction for two Papa Johns pizzas, a group of U.S. and Canadian regulators revealed Operation Cryptosweep, an extensive operation looking into nearly 70 inquiries of alleged cryptocurrency fraud. To add insult to injury, on Wednesday, the fourth largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash, dropped to its lowest level in a month, recovering slightly before the week's end. But it wasn't all bad news for blockchain on what might accurately be dubbed Bitcoin Pizza week. Also on Wednesday, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Coinbase, announced it has purchased an Ethereum startup with the potential to reimagine the way it serves many of its customers, and computer giant IBM unveiled new camera technology designed in part to give those using blockchain to track diamonds a way to ensure the diamonds really are what they seem to be.\nCurrent Price Of Top 5 Coins (by market cap)\nBitcoin (BTC): $7,495\nEthereum (ETH): $602\nRipple (XRP): $0.6112\nBitcoin Cash/BCC (BCH): $1,038\nEOS (EOS): $12\nSource: CoinMarketCap.

We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment” and BitCaw didn’t set up BTC Global, he said.\nBTC Global’s services are suspended, according to that company’s website.

The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network.

The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain.

One of its largest energy suppliers, Pražská Plynárenská, has announced that it will start accepting payments from customers in the form of cryptocurrencies. The first to be rolled out, will be Bitcoin (BTC) payments that will be available as soon as early June. This move brings the energy sector closer to the cryptocurrencies that use the valuable resource for mining.\nPražská Plynárenská is one of the largest Natural Gas suppliers in the Czech Republic with a customer base of over 420,000. The company is also actively engaged in solar P.V installations, electricity and home heating systems. The company further provides automated data processing, software delivery and IT training and consultancy services. The Czech company also has a hand in the telecommunications industry, real estate maintenance, motor vehicle maintenance and road passenger transport.\nIt is with this background of Pražská Plynárenská diversifying its business that it is no surprise that the company intends on embracing cryptocurrency payments. The CEO of the company, Pavel Janeček, was very emphatic about the new service and had this to say:\nIn June, we are opening a payment gateway, which will automatically transfer our bitcoin payments into regular currency, so that we don’t have to speculate with cryptocurrency.

Well, it is due to the fact that most of the altcoins are erc20 which is compatible to Ethereum wallet or myetherwallet(MEW).

The issue we all have is the failure of price,-value-to reflect the effort of the community. Not only do we have a robust network that can scale and settle transactions faster, there is wide adoption of the coin from different payment providers and merchants. As it is, Bitcoin Cash is down 14 percent for the week and two percent in the last 24 hours but these metrics would widen should there be a dip past $930 or May 24 lows. Today's price action is therefore important in my view.\nFrom the News A cryptocurrency would be useless if there it has no real user case encouraging retail or corporate adoption. This is why behemoths like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple for example are driving hard selling their products to the masses. Bitcoin Cash is doing the same and few days after forking, Revolut is listing BCH as a tradable asset or investment to their customers. In essence, the London based payment provider is making it possible for customers to integrate their fiat banking details and link it directly to their Revolut card.\nThis way, their users would enjoy instant fiat-crypto transfer via Bitstamp who charges 1.5 percent transaction fees via a simple dash board. Going forward, Bitcoin Cash would be an option for buyers and it's not a speculation or ifs because whenever a coin is available to the masses, market capitalization and liquidity follow suits. We expect the same to happen to Bitcoin Cash in the days to come.\nThousands of miles away, there is good news for Bitcoin Cash supporters in Colombia. Bitek might turn out to be their gate-away. As a payment provider, merchants spread throughout Colombia can now receive payment in Bitcoin Cash and convert them to Pesos should they want to liquidate. This is not the first such service as it is similar to what BitPay is doing. Services like these protect merchants from price volatility as they can sell their BCH stash anytime and get their Pesos in an instant. To facilitate this, Bitek will use BCH-Pesos approximates from local cryptocurrency exchanges and Bittrex.\nIt's official! We accept #Litecoin #BitcoinCash and #Dash and of course continue to take #Bitcoin ! Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans! https://t.co/WJG9GdW1sq\n— CheapAir (@CheapAir) May 22, 2018\nOn daily user case front, Cheap Air now accepts payment in Bitcoin Cash and a host of other currencies including Litecoin and Dogecoin.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nBefore this week, many enthusiasts thought Bitcoin Cash hard fork would jolt prices to higher levels as buy pressure flow back to the market. Disappointingly, that was not and hasn't been the case considering price action this week. What we are seeing is sellers pushing prices and printing new lows as days pass.\nIn the last seven days for example, Bitcoin Cash was the third worst performer in the top 10 after Cardano and IOTA. The question in everybody's mind is this: will this trend change or Bitcoin Cash liquidation continues despite better features in their new network update?\nIn my view, the general crypto sentiment is still bearish and any bear candlestick today reversing attempts of higher highs in the last two days might initiate another wave of sell pressure driving prices back to $850. On the same vein, any extension of that long lower wick this weekend could create a spring board effect propelling Bitcoin Cash back to $1500.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nAfter May 18 higher highs and fake bullish break out, prices broke below $1100 and now, we are trending at previous key support lines around $850. Our stops were obliterated and many more are likely to be hit if we maintain a bullish outlook in a yet to be confirmed bullish reversal.\nThe trend is down but market participants would be telling us a different story if we see higher highs building on May 24 bullish candlestick bouncing off from around main support at $850. Then again, on the back ground there is a divergence between prices and volumes. While the later increases, prices are going down. Regardless, we remain neutral at the moment and the only time I will recommend buys is when an up-thrust above $1300 happens. Otherwise, any drop below May 24 lows at $930 and BCH would likely test $850.\nThe post Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (May 26, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch) price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T03:14:58.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c22c942bf2beaa7ed527fca0501a52094e6c3770", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKFNld5wQ4o6vyB3xFP8aoU1OpyOvzBwwRwreKj_Z2.Kvkt7jEeD8ywF5F0Vxj8efa173ysKIiwkQ-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.ar", "site": "freelancer.com.ar", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.ar/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Add Bitcoin payment to existing Php script", "title_full": "Add Bitcoin payment to existing Php script", "published": "2018-05-26T03:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c22c942bf2beaa7ed527fca0501a52094e6c3770", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKFNld5wQ4o6vyB3xFP8aoU1OpyOvzBwwRwreKj_Z2.Kvkt7jEeD8ywF5F0Vxj8efa173ysKIiwkQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-26T03:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Add Bitcoin payment to existing Php script", "text": "Add Bitcoin payment to existing Php script\nI posted this previously and accepted a programmer.

Failure to do so, the letter claimed, would result in a trademark infringement lawsuit.\n“I didn’t believe it at first since I knew that bitcoin and the bitcoin logo are public domain, and even a similar trademark application in the US failed,” the user wrote.\nHowever, as the business owner soon found out, a company called A.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC successfully obtained a trademark for “Bitcoin” last month after initially submitting the application on Dec. 27, 2017.\nA.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC is listed as a subsidiary of Monolip LTD, whose mailing address appears to be a rented mailbox at a London branch of Mail Boxes Etc.\nThe firm has only applied for one other trademark, “Westworld,” presumably due to its association with the HBO show of the same name. The application for this trademark has been published, but it has not yet been examined by the IP office.\nContact information for the company was not immediately available, so CCN was unable to reach them for comment. The user who claimed to have received the letter did not immediately reply to an inquiry about how they intended to respond.\nIt’s unclear whether the threat-sender (presumably A.B.C. IPHoldings South West or Monolip LTD) will carry out its threat, and whether the threat would hold up in court remains to be seen as well.\nIn any case, it’s surprising that a company was able to successfully trademark the term, particularly since the flagship cryptocurrency has more or less achieved mainstream recognition over the past several years.\nAs CCN reported , a Moscow-based company unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a Russian trademark for “Bitcoin” in 2016. Previously, the US Patent and Trademark Office rejected a California company’s attempt to obtain a “Bitcoin” trademark, though US firms can register longer trademarks that include the word.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003279106"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "etsy store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T01:29:28.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebb6935b27e76707da80f4a23b73305817053861", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwr2YV2isIWc2H1x7b7z.8ZLTKEr_Pgjfl38lyBaUFlirmxUW3QLFXk0OftfiA5IwanDNUoeQoBoPlC0sDaVsBTg2gpnFdrpM07KCApE82janJ0Jkjf6d374pSGfh8IATPpUPX5pGlyDA--", "site_full": "freealt.co.in", "site": "freealt.co.in", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["contests_and_freebies", "shopping"], "section_title": "", "title": "Author Niall Ferguson: I Wish I Had a Bitcoin for Every ‘Phony’ ICO White Paper Received - Free Altcoins", "title_full": "Author Niall Ferguson: I Wish I Had a Bitcoin for Every ‘Phony’ ICO White Paper Received - Free Altcoins", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.326, "main_image": "http://tradecryptoco.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-best-source-of-free-altcoins.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebb6935b27e76707da80f4a23b73305817053861", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwr2YV2isIWc2H1x7b7z.8ZLTKEr_Pgjfl38lyBaUFlirmxUW3QLFXk0OftfiA5IwanDNUoeQoBoPlC0sDaVsBTg2gpnFdrpM07KCApE82janJ0Jkjf6d374pSGfh8IATPpUPX5pGlyDA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Author Niall Ferguson: I Wish I Had a Bitcoin for Every ‘Phony’ ICO White Paper Received - Free Altcoins", "text": "Niall Ferguson, author of ‘The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World’, has spoken out against initial coin offerings (ICO) because of the associated potential for fraud and scams. Rooting out Bad Actors in ICO Market Ferguson’s comments were said at a seminar recently held by the Bank of England, where he shared his support for Bitcoin, but spoke out against the associated, often unregulated fundraising method of ICOs. “I wish I had a Bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said according to Quartz . “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.” ICOs have been increasingly making headlines — especially following the astronomic rise in the value of cryptocurrencies that was seen toward the end of 2017. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) released an analysis of the fundraising method , but Ferguson believes the organization might just be scratching the surface. ICO Red Flags To research the industry, the WSJ combed the white papers — documents outlining the specifics of a company’s ICO — of 1,450 ICOs, finding 271 ‘red flags.’ These red flags include things like celebrity endorsements, promises of exceptionally high returns, and (false) claims of regulatory compliance.\nOf the projects that the WSJ singled out as suspicious, most were uncovered because of plagiarized texts, images of team members and/or investors taken from stock photography banks. In 111 cases, entire sections of company white papers were simply copied and pasted from competitors websites. Even more scary is that, put together, the 271 ICOs identified as having red flags they have garnered a combined sum of over $1 billion from investors. This is according to a review of company statements and online transaction records performed by the WSJ. Regulators Strike Back While some of the projects are still raising money, others have shut down or have been frozen by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal regulatory authority that has been tasked with investigating ICOs and other potentially fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency space. These moves by U.S. regulators come less than a week after the SEC created their own fake ICO website , which was developed in attempts to show potential investors the obvious signs of ICO scams. On the site , HoweyCoin — which takes its name from the 1946 four-part Howey test, created to determine what qualifies as a security — is presented as a way to invest in the luxury travel market. But it’s all a ruse, created to show potential investors just how easy it can be to fall victim to such scams. The WSJ is not alone in its scrutiny of ICOs. In fact, other reports signal even deeper problems in the market. For example, according to news organization Izvestia, who cited the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, half of the $300 million raised by ICOs in Russia in 2017 were pyramid schemes. Another source, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, was asked what the percentage of ICO fraud is, to which he answered: ‘Somewhere north of 50?’ While the numbers here are clearly hard to properly grasp, and although they may vary, they’re still indicative of a large problem. Moving forward, if regulators want retail investors to stop being scammed by unregulated schemes, they have to demonstrate the value of oversight, promote fairness, and emphasize the common adage that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is.

Not bad for a company whose primary focus isn’t digital currency trading. Revolut supports about 120 different fiat currencies, allowing people from different parts of the world to make use of its services. The firm differs from most traditional crypto exchange platforms in a few ways. Account holders cannot use the Revolut app to transfer or receive cryptocurrency tokens. The platform only enables the buying/selling and holding of cryptocurrency tokens. Revolut also has a vault service that allows users to save small amounts of cryptocurrencies. Recent Revolut Developments\nRevolut currently has a user base of 1.95 million customers with more than 20 percent of that figure engaged in the company’s cryptocurrency exchange service. The company wants to increase its user base to 100 million in the next five years. As part of these expansion efforts, Nikolay Storonsky, the CEO of Revolut announced recently that the firm plans to issue a new debit card. He went on to say :\nIn the next three months, we’re going to launch Platinum cards; it’s a metallic card that allows you to get 1% cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service.\nDespite being only three years old, Revolut is already a fintech unicorn valued at more than $1.7 billion. The company recently completed a $250 million fundraising round targeted at expanding its operations. The London-based fintech firm also plans to apply for a European banking license. The company is no stranger to successful funding rounds having already completed three of such rounds in the past.\nWill Revolut be able to meet its target of 100 million users in the next five years? Should the firm add more cryptocurrencies to its trading catalog?
