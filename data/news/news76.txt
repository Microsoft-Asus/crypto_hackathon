Bitcoin is a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. You might be interested in Bitcoin if you like cryptography, distributed peer-to-peer systems, or economics. A large percentage of Bitcoin enthusiasts are libertarians, though people of all political philosophies are welcome. Subscribe Guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link. Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.

Carney, known for his distaste for digital currencies as a means of payment, reiterated his interest in blockchain technologies and their transformative role in the future of finance.\n“Is our role going to be changing the payment systems and helping private providers of digital money, or will we go all the way to a central bank issued digital currency? This is one of the most exciting and important areas. And certainly the most important area to get right,” Carney said in an interview published by the Riksbank on Thursday.\nBitcoin’s technical picture\nOn the intraday level, BTC/USD is supported by $7,400, surrounded by a number of technically important levels.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,020 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move above the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels to gain further in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is consolidating below $1,040 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must gather momentum above $1,040 to accelerate gains.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance During the past few sessions, there were mostly ranging moves below $1,040 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price tested the $1,030 level recently, but it failed to move past the stated resistance. As a result, there was a slight downside reaction and the price moved towards the $980 level. During the decline, it broke the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $945 low to $1,033 high.\nHowever, the decline was limited as buyers appeared around the $980 support area. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $945 low to $1,033 high also acted as a support. At the moment, the price is trading nicely above the $980 level. Below this, the next major support is at $950 and the 100 hourly simple moving average . On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,020 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a monster barrier near the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels. A break and close above $1,040 is needed for buyers to take control. Above $1,040, the next stop for buyers could be around the $1,100 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently moving higher towards the 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Facing Crucial Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T07:40:39.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5c356c940c3bc7e66b138f7b6df3459220f80af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywOl5DShMMW5AtIyXMmRySGDGlkvrao6spTJrQtW8KxBg-", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Is That a Reversal Formation?", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Is That a Reversal Formation?", "published": "2018-06-01T07:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5c356c940c3bc7e66b138f7b6df3459220f80af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywOl5DShMMW5AtIyXMmRySGDGlkvrao6spTJrQtW8KxBg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T07:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Is That a Reversal Formation?", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\nBitcoin price could be due for a reversal as an inverse head and shoulders can be seen on the 1-hour chart. Price has yet to break past the neckline to confirm that an uptrend is in the cards. Technical indicators are showing signs of a return in bullish momentum. Bitcoin could finally be done with its slide as it forms an inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern on the 1-hour chart.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is still more likely to resume than to reverse.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages has narrowed enough to signal an imminent bullish crossover. Bitcoin price is also trading above these moving averages as an early signal of bullish momentum. From here, the 100 SMA and 200 SMA could hold as dynamic support.\nRSI is pointing up without even hitting oversold levels, suggesting that buyers are eager to return. Stochastic is also turning higher so bitcoin price might follow suit if this keeps up. A break past the neckline around $7,600 could lead to a climb of the same height as the reversal pattern.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin has battled with its fair share of positive and negative commentary over the past few days, but it looks like the cryptocurrency could regain ground. A bit of month-end profit-taking may have also been factored in.\nThe US dollar is on weaker footing owing the resurfacing trade war fears, with the government imposing higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. This has prompted retaliatory measures from its trade allies, which might then dampen global trade activity and growth.\nA fresh month could bring a new round of catalysts from the industry and investors appear to be looking a bit more optimistic so far.

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nBanks are more conservative than bitcoin when it comes to high risk high reward part, means btc is more volatile but that doesnt mean that banks are safer. It simply means that in bitcoin, it's riskier in terms of it's movement, it can move 20% in a matter of minutes and fall in a few seconds, but i'd rather hold my btc than invest in a bank, unless i have a good amount of money, then i diversify my investments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T04:29:26.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d7e9491dbad1b09788cf5bc805e0ca262ec0ce1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRz.nVwYnYW_.xO5Zj0H_f8yM2bzu5a_EVwFQsKoae0Mt5xzmfdfoeh7Q0VHAXQbr6HQGFs0ELDRf33HICTNjbjY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitcoin Core BTC dev Eric Lombrozo comes out publicly and says he supports the state regulation of Bitcoin to replace Bitcoin miners!!", "title_full": "Bitcoin Core BTC dev Eric Lombrozo comes out publicly and says he supports the state regulation of Bitcoin to replace Bitcoin miners!! : btc", "published": "2018-06-01T07:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d7e9491dbad1b09788cf5bc805e0ca262ec0ce1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRz.nVwYnYW_.xO5Zj0H_f8yM2bzu5a_EVwFQsKoae0Mt5xzmfdfoeh7Q0VHAXQbr6HQGFs0ELDRf33HICTNjbjY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "increaseblocks", "published": "2018-06-01T07:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Core BTC dev Eric Lombrozo comes out publicly and says he supports the state regulation of Bitcoin to replace Bitcoin miners!!", "text": "submitted by /u/increaseblocks\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/eric_lombrozo/status/1002292512109690880?s=21"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T04:50:30.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f0dc76fb131ac58311930b546d19f2611583379", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHUmprfmuwCp8IzfLxppXjNKUwcHJrnFuN0SchM0N_B4kE.fPo9LDF4x0P0GbN4lC8wIbn5mInYEMWGMYdj_7Ky77o06lVxCaPphTVLtp0aQ--", "site_full": "vpnwp.com", "site": "vpnwp.com", "site_section": "https://vpnwp.com/feed", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "VpnWP", "title": "Poysa – Bitcoin and Crypto Currency Bootstrap Template (Marketing)", "title_full": "Poysa – Bitcoin and Crypto Currency Bootstrap Template (Marketing)", "published": "2018-06-01T07:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/vpnwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/no-image1.gif?resize=400%2C330&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f0dc76fb131ac58311930b546d19f2611583379", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHUmprfmuwCp8IzfLxppXjNKUwcHJrnFuN0SchM0N_B4kE.fPo9LDF4x0P0GbN4lC8wIbn5mInYEMWGMYdj_7Ky77o06lVxCaPphTVLtp0aQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "danroo", "published": "2018-06-01T07:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Poysa – Bitcoin and Crypto Currency Bootstrap Template (Marketing)", "text": "Powered by GDPR plugin Privacy Overview\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

Private Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them A private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret.

To earn money from crypto you must only mentally fit. So crypto or bitcoin is perfect for disabled person.\nBitcoin is really a good support for disable person to become financially independent and it will be great help for him to support his family and get all the luxuries of life, so if he is mentally good and have good knowledge and digital skills he can earn more than able people who are now at regular job so bitcoin is best currency which helps all talented people where physical disability has no connection to it.\nRight.Bitcoin has open a wide opportunities for everyone so those people who still have good ideas to share,good eyesight and complete hands to do computer works are very much qualified to partipate into bounty or signature campaigns as this is the most common source of income here in bitcoin community.Bitcoin is not just more of a fast payment system,but it also offers a wide variety of works that even disabled persons can do depending on their disabilities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

for our money but here he is not telling about the transactions of the money but he is talking about the saving as he is saying that the value of it will drop. But even here I will not agree with him because every person have a saving for his longer time and he have a target for that and if he will have a,longer target then till that time the value of bitcoin will be higher and he will not feel any thing lost.

Learning how to securely archive records that hold private keys like a JSON file or exporting, importing, and sweeping can provide people with the basic steps towards really owning bitcoin.\nAlso read: Localbitcoincash.org Revamps Website and Adds New P2P Features Private Key Ownership Provides Financial Sovereignty\nEvery day someone new is learning about the fantastic benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency solutions. Many people will have acquired their first digital asset from an exchange like Coinbase or Circle Invest, but have yet to learn how to secure their private keys so they can really own those precious cryptocurrencies. The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners.\nIf you don’t possess your private key, you don’t own bitcoins. Private Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them\nA private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret.\nIf you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method.\nMnemonic Phrase\nIf someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings. An example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key.\nA Backup Keyfile or JSON File\nThere are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys. The Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping\nImport\nThere are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys.\nSweep\nEssentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden. Bitcoin: Be Your Own Bank\nAs we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency’s keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership. The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank .\nAre you sure you own your private keys?

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,020 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move above the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels to gain further in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price is consolidating below $1,040 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD must gather momentum above $1,040 to accelerate gains. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nDuring the past few sessions, there were mostly ranging moves below $1,040 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price tested the $1,030 level recently, but it failed to move past the stated resistance. As a result, there was a slight downside reaction and the price moved towards the $980 level. During the decline, it broke the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $945 low to $1,033 high.\nHowever, the decline was limited as buyers appeared around the $980 support area. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $945 low to $1,033 high also acted as a support. At the moment, the price is trading nicely above the $980 level. Below this, the next major support is at $950 and the 100 hourly simple moving average . On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,020 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a monster barrier near the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels. A break and close above $1,040 is needed for buyers to take control. Above $1,040, the next stop for buyers could be around the $1,100 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is slowly moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is currently moving higher towards the 55 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $950\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Facing Crucial Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T19:35:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77e9064a74b6fc0a0cdad371879c77cac650172e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRH_GumPSNQ5aKAfjBpMCDXVvknokNcTwdhrmpKREkOQN8AfPl0.39oqovJIp4e8sZG", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/daily-forex", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Daily Forex - Barchart.com", "title": "By: DailyForex.com BTC\\/USD Bitcoin rallied agai", "title_full": "By: DailyForex.com BTC\\/USD Bitcoin rallied agai", "published": "2018-06-01T07:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77e9064a74b6fc0a0cdad371879c77cac650172e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRH_GumPSNQ5aKAfjBpMCDXVvknokNcTwdhrmpKREkOQN8AfPl0.39oqovJIp4e8sZG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher Lewis", "published": "2018-06-01T07:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "By: DailyForex.com BTC\\/USD Bitcoin rallied agai", "text": "By: DailyForex.com BTC\\/USD\nBitcoin rallied again during the day on Friday, after initially pulling back on Thursday. The market looks as if it is trying to test the 7600 level, but quite frankly I think a lot of this is confusion based around the tariffs and the potential troubles that we are starting to see in global trade. People may be trying to use bitcoin as a bit of a safety trade, but quite frankly in the end I don’t think that’s going to work. I see significant resistance at the $8000 level, and it’s not until we break above there that I am overly impressed. That being said, the market did gain 2.7% during the day, which is one of the stronger moves that we have seen recently. Ultimately, if we did break above the $8000 level then I would be convinced to start buying. Until then, I’m looking for exhaustive candle to start selling.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin rallied against the Japanese yen as well, reaching towards the ¥825,000 level. The market still sees a significant amount of resistance near the ¥850,000 level, and most certainly at the ¥900,000 level. I think that the market will eventually find sellers, especially if the whole situation with global trade can calm down, or if we get some type of melt down in the USD\\/JPY pair, as it would send many looking for the Japanese Yen overall. The market would then go looking towards the ¥700,000 level underneath which is the bottom of the longer-term consolidation. I don’t have any interest in buying this pair, at least not right now while things are so skittish. If I was going to buying Bitcoin, it would probably be against either the US dollar or the Euro.\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

It has created a registry for multiple types of intellectual property such as books, songs, technology, and pictures. It uses a decentralized registry that is becoming common in today’s society.\nBy having multiple relays all across the country there is increased security compared to many other forms of intellectual property systems in the country.\nLike traditional blockchain systems, EDRID cannot be altered without confirmation from a variety of hosts. This insures that one user cannot alter the system without multiple people being involved.\nAs seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum this system works wonders in terms of security measures and in insuring multiple accounts of every interaction. It is an easily accessible system that should allow for millions of citizens to connect and get records of their intellectual property that cannot be tampered with. This heightened security will restore faith in intellectual property for many Russian content creators. Russian Copyright\nPiracy among Russian companies has been a relatively substantial and long-lasting problem. Since the advent of the internet online piracy has taken the country by storm. Violations of intellectual property are rampant in the country, and EDRID seems to be a step in the right direction for combating this serious issue.\nMany individuals lack faith in the traditional outlets for getting intellectual property confirmed because the possibility for abuse Is rife. Small content creators are hurt the most by the current state of intellectual property rights in Russia because there is little to no guarantee that their claim will not be altered or stolen .\nIt is unknown how major Russian corporations will take this technology. Traditionally, they utilize the usual outlets for getting their intellectual property confirmed, but as the world has seen, blockchain is likely the future of the world so it might be in these countries best interest to hop on the cutting edge of this newly developed and rapidly evolving technology if they wish to keep up with the increasingly digital society.\nRussia recently saw the advent of a similar digital registry in the form of IPChain which was an initiative sponsored by the government to create a unifying digital registry for Intellectual property claims. In most forms of intellectual property registry’s in Russia there is an influx of fraud and lack of transparency . IPChain turned to blockchain technology to solve this issue. Rather than a gradual increase in transparency they offer complete transparency where each transaction is not recorded by the company but by the individuals that make up the blockchain. Intellectual Property Revolution\nTop level officials are offering their support to blockchain technology for intellectual property. They see it as a solution that will make up for the laws and regulations that failed to properly address Russia’s intellectual property problem.\nEDRID seems to be a huge step towards addressing the intellectual property issues of the 21 st century. In an era where the digitization of most mass media has caused intellectual property violations to be rampant, this digital, blockchain registry offers a solution that may revolutionize the way intellectual property is handled all across the world.

Price has yet to break past the neckline to confirm that an uptrend is in the cards. Technical indicators are showing signs of a return in bullish momentum.\nBitcoin could finally be done with its slide as it forms an inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern on the 1-hour chart.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is still more likely to resume than to reverse.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages has narrowed enough to signal an imminent bullish crossover. Bitcoin price is also trading above these moving averages as an early signal of bullish momentum. From here, the 100 SMA and 200 SMA could hold as dynamic support.\nRSI is pointing up without even hitting oversold levels, suggesting that buyers are eager to return. Stochastic is also turning higher so bitcoin price might follow suit if this keeps up. A break past the neckline around $7,600 could lead to a climb of the same height as the reversal pattern. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin has battled with its fair share of positive and negative commentary over the past few days, but it looks like the cryptocurrency could regain ground. A bit of month-end profit-taking may have also been factored in.\nThe US dollar is on weaker footing owing the resurfacing trade war fears, with the government imposing higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. This has prompted retaliatory measures from its trade allies, which might then dampen global trade activity and growth.\nA fresh month could bring a new round of catalysts from the industry and investors appear to be looking a bit more optimistic so far. Looking ahead, the NFP report could still influence dollar price action before the weekend starts.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Is That a Reversal Formation? appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T19:35:47.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e79de74f52848c98f5a9b52629e76c89af567ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR_roMxChrv9OrMIaydBnnScyxnv_8gmi8hy1HqAls3ksUkwtBw6MHM2UOejFBRt2uQGSL7DtTmzVHqH7Up3d9rg-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Powerful quote from Andreas \"Sellout\" Antonopolos regarding bitcoin devs:", "title_full": "Powerful quote from Andreas \"Sellout\" Antonopolos regarding bitcoin devs: : btc", "published": "2018-06-01T07:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e79de74f52848c98f5a9b52629e76c89af567ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR_roMxChrv9OrMIaydBnnScyxnv_8gmi8hy1HqAls3ksUkwtBw6MHM2UOejFBRt2uQGSL7DtTmzVHqH7Up3d9rg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bambarasta", "published": "2018-06-01T07:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Powerful quote from Andreas \"Sellout\" Antonopolos regarding bitcoin devs:", "text": "This link was posted today.

I just wonder what/who make the price of bitcoin, and what does it depend on?\nNo one controls the price of bitcoin. Its price suddenly changes because of the supply and demand system. Bitcoin increases in price when many are using it, many needs it and many invest on it. But its value will go lower if many will sell it.\nSince it is a known fact that whales are able to manipulate the market, one might be inclined to say that some people do control the price of Bitcoin. What is fact, is that whales only go the far of jostling the prevailing market price by way of their huge volumes, but like every altered state of equilibrium, the market normalizes sooner or later, which goes to assert that market forces are what determines what price Bitcoin turns up.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T11:34:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb2f32fa02d88a513b3f47b39cb98cc1a04a0fda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaXOj.3R8RHaS2OyErIoJwEB4ZJ1nl81vwSjCgpZBXdRQcdjYS9mUio67GCuj2qbhNIQkoLTuWqFP4XtMY9ohkgA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin: DOJ Probe To Decimate Liquidity : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin: DOJ Probe To Decimate Liquidity : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-01T06:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb2f32fa02d88a513b3f47b39cb98cc1a04a0fda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaXOj.3R8RHaS2OyErIoJwEB4ZJ1nl81vwSjCgpZBXdRQcdjYS9mUio67GCuj2qbhNIQkoLTuWqFP4XtMY9ohkgA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fallenkeith75", "published": "2018-06-01T06:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: DOJ Probe To Decimate Liquidity : CryptoCurrency", "text": "submitted by /u/Fallenkeith75\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://seekingalpha.com/article/4178485-bitcoin-doj-probe-decimate-liquidity"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T12:18:40.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb5888627fd0afa26541f34228b0f56a3bb5f70c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6Xdb9mCvH4a7X04CH9a3hJLqPaIuVmWN04J91tksxfylzlG.lDRai21qrVAqlBPEEiuYE7aUnOYo0gOV7JvRhdDtcXECwziKSf9V9PyirTjPgLAJdFL8lTDlPDLJhxizkw2JQkNd1pVlofRHXLp0K0qCmySFzGjJvQ--", "site_full": "www.digitaljournal.com", "site": "digitaljournal.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/rss/?feed=latest_news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RSS Feed - Latest Digital Journal News", "title": "Bitcoin price rising but still below $8,000 level for now", "title_full": "Bitcoin price rising but still below $8,000 level for now", "published": "2018-06-01T06:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/1/0/4/8/0/9/3/i/3/7/2/p-large/8dcfaf44c11e340be83638cff84da11ecbce4ee4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25058, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb5888627fd0afa26541f34228b0f56a3bb5f70c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6Xdb9mCvH4a7X04CH9a3hJLqPaIuVmWN04J91tksxfylzlG.lDRai21qrVAqlBPEEiuYE7aUnOYo0gOV7JvRhdDtcXECwziKSf9V9PyirTjPgLAJdFL8lTDlPDLJhxizkw2JQkNd1pVlofRHXLp0K0qCmySFzGjJvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T06:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price rising but still below $8,000 level for now", "text": "By Ken Hanly May 31, 2018 in Technology A Coindesk analysis today notes that the recent sell-off ran out of steam yesterday at $7, 270. As the article went to press at 10:30 UTC on May31 bitcoin (BTC)) was trading at $7,535 on Bitfinex and was up 0.6 percent over the last 24 hours. Recent bitcoin price movements Bitcoin seemed to be ready for a corrective rally on Wednesday after there was a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday. The appended You Tube video explains an outside day. Investopedia e xplains the technical concept of a candle. However, around the 50-candle moving average (MA) of $7,550 the price had trouble moving higher. There was a sell-off that ran out of steam at $7,270. There was then a rally that resulted in the price moving above the 50-candle MA today at $7,441. When the CoinDesk article went to press at 10:30 UTC on May 31, the price was at $7,535 a gain of 0.6 percent over 24 hours. The four-hour chart The recovery from $7,250 up to $7,570 created a higher low pattern that is a bullish sign that added strength to the Tuesday outside-day candle along with the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence. The price could test supply at about the $7,870 level. The price could also reach the important 50-week MA now located at $7,711. If the close this Sunday is above that level it would indicate that the bearish trend is invalidated. Weekly chart The chart shows that the last weekly candle had closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since October 2015, in theory indicating the end of a long-term bull run. Although there are bullish signals, the article suggests that one should be cautious as 50, 100 and 200 day MAs are biased towards the bears as well as the 10-day MA on the 4-hour chart. Coindesk's outlook For the near future , the article predicts: \"Bitcoin will likely soon rise to $7,870 (descending trendline hurdle) in the next 24 hours. A high-volume break above that level would allow a re-test of the 50-day moving average, currently located at $8,522. Bearish scenario: The moving averages are maintaining a bearish bias, so a drop to $6,900 could be on the cards if the bulls fail to capitalize on the break above $7,500 and the price drops below $7,270 in the next 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is working its way through the key supply zone above $7,500 and could test resistance at $7,870 in the next 24 hours, the technical charts indicate.\" The present situation As of 02:30 on June 1 UTC the price of bitcoin was $7,505.76 just slightly below the high so far of $7,520.38.

Many people will have acquired their first digital asset from an exchange like Coinbase or Circle Invest, but have yet to learn how to secure their private keys so they can really own those precious cryptocurrencies. The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners.\nIf you don't possess your private key, you don't own bitcoins.\nPrivate Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them A private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret.\nIf you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it's good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method.\nMnemonic Phrase\nIf someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings.\nAn example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key. A Backup Keyfile or JSON File\nThere are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins' private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can't gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys.\nThe Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping Import\nThere are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys.\nSweep\nEssentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it's not kept hidden.\nBitcoin: Be Your Own Bank As we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency's keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership. The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank .\nAre you sure you own your private keys?

Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret.\nIf you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method.\nMnemonic Phrase\nIf someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings. An example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key.\nA Backup Keyfile or JSON File\nThere are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys. The Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping\nImport\nThere are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys.\nSweep\nEssentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden. Bitcoin: Be Your Own Bank\nAs we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency’s keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership. The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank .\nAre you sure you own your private keys?

Furthermore, economic law is enacted, supported by constructive news. So when there is good news usually increase the number of requests, so the price will likely rise, so vice versa.\nGetting the demand it needed turns to its value to get high.

J., Inet Detik - Asus showcased its newest motherboard called H370 Mining Master. From the name alone, this motherboard has been seen made for the needs of cryptocurrency mining. What are its advantages?\nThe advantage is support for 20 graphics cards that can be used on this motherboard simultaneously. Not only that, the 20 graphics card is connected to the motherboard using a riser USB cable so it is not directly attached to the motherboard.\nIt makes device maintenance easier, reduces the number of graphics card revocations via PCIe, as well as more accurate diagnostics. According to Asus, this format is better than plugging the graphics card directly into the PCIe slot on the motherboard.\nAsus H370 Mining Master, Image Source: Inet Detik The name, \"Mining Master\" that carried on H370 not only because it can support 20 graphics card, but because this motherboard is optimized for cryptocurrency mining, as quoted from The Verge, Friday, June 1, 2018.\nThe emergence of digital currency mining is indeed changing the PC hardware industry drastically, such as making the price of graphics cards soaring because of less supply. In addition, PC component manufacturers also create components that are optimized for mining activities, one of them Asus. Asus is not the first company to make special cryptomining motherboards. Nevertheless, until now, support for the most graphics card on the motherboard made by the manufacturer from Taiwan.\nThe price of the H370 Mining Master has not been announced yet, but when it is

In other words, boom and bust cycles are natural occurrences, and the incumbent financial system is the best humans can do, if only the sluggish economies could just get it together.\nSkidelsky argues:\nThe fact is that human societies have discovered no better way to keep the value of money roughly constant than by relying on central banks to exercise control over its issue and to act directly or indirectly on the volume of credit created by the commercial banking system.\nBut let's leave the Keynes versus Hayek debate for another article. Instead, what stands out like a sore thumb is not only the complacency and the knee-jerk reaction to defend the status quo, but doing so through ignorance of Bitcoin's fundamental properties.\nAmusingly, Skidelsky even acknowledges that \"the technical details of the new cash-generation systems are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.\"\nA person from the early 20th century might have also said that \"the technical details of the airplane are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.\"\nHence, the mere attempt to improve money is rebuked because all previous attempts have failed to come up with anything better than the paper mill that is today's financial system. Skidelsky dismisses Bitcoin as merely the latest attempt to use new technology \"to stop money from going bad.\"\nLet's take a look at some examples of the erroneous statements made by the emeritus of political economy.\nLie 1: It's Created Out of Nothing Paradoxically, although it is created out of nothing, it will offer no possibility of money 'creation.'\nFirst, bitcoins aren't created out of \"nothing.\" Second, since it's already being accepted as a medium of exchange in many places online and across the globe for goods or services, then it's de facto money.\nFurthermore, energy, coding skills, resources, and time spent on software and hardware development and production are just some of the components required to run and maintain the Bitcoin network. It is also underpinned by a globally distributed network of users who all agree to play by the rules of the network for their own benefit.\nThe more users in this network, the greater the value of Bitcoin will become, according to Metcalfe's law .\nLie 2: No Elasticity Bitcoin will be 'mined' in diminishing quantities until it is exhausted in 2040, having delivered 21 million digital coins. In other words, there is no elasticity in the currency… [T]he currency will run into the same problem as the gold standard: not providing enough money to support a growing economy and population.\nFirst, Skidelsky is off by a century as the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140 , though most will enter the supply by 2030.\nSecond, the problem was never with gold itself but the debasement of gold and thus the distortion of value. For example, most scholars believe it was the \"clipping\" of gold coins that was largely responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire . The publicly verifiable and immutable ledger of bitcoin ensures that this monetary network can't be tampered with, unlike with fiat.\nThird, unlike gold, a bitcoin is merely the name of a digital unit (whose value is determined by the market). This makes it highly divisible. In fact, the smallest possible unit is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0. 1 BTC) — called a 'satoshi'— making it possible to send tiny fractions of a penny at current market prices. This can't be done even with digital fiat today, let alone physical cash or metal coins.\nThis, in fact, makes Bitcoin the most elastic form of money ever created as the 21 billion digital units equal to roughly 2,099,999,997,690,000 (over 2 quadrillion) satoshis according to the calculations presented here . What's more, new layer-2 applications built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, such as the Lightning Network , will enable the ability to send even smaller amounts off-chain.\nLie 3: Deflation Will Lead to 'Hoarding' This [lack of money supply] would be exacerbated by any tendency to hoard bitcoins.\nHoarding is a pejorative term for saving. If there is no saving, then there is no capital. And there can be no capitalism without capital.\nThe \"deflationary death spiral\" argument against sound money is an overblown theory perpetuated by Keynesian economists, which is refuted here .\nIn fact, some argue that saving actually leads to greater consumption in the long-run. Saifedean Ammous explains this concept in his book, The Bitcoin Standard , stating:\nA society which constantly defers consumption will actually end up being a society that consumes more in the long-run than a low savings society, since the low time-preference society invests more, thus producing more income for its members. Even with a larger percentage of their income going to savings, the low time-preference societies will end up having higher levels of consumption in the long-run, as well as a larger capital stock.\nYou can also read more about the advantages of having a capped supply in a new report from BitMex Research here .\nLie 4: Inflation Cryptocurrencies provide no security against inflation.\nSkidelsky doesn't specify which inflation he's actually referring to – monetary supply inflation vs. price inflation. Though the two are correlated, the latter is an integral feature of fiat currencies whose value is guaranteed to depreciate over time as more money is printed.\nSooner or later, the incentive for governments and central banks to print more money becomes irresistible to the detriment of the population. Inflation is also sometimes referred to as a \"hidden tax\" that is much easier to impose on citizens as opposed to direct taxation.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin's monetary supply is not only controlled but is fully transparent and known to all. Even the gold supply cannot be as accurately predicted. Whereas the 21 million digital units that will ever exist are a key property of the Bitcoin protocol that cements its digital scarcity .\nPut differently, the millions of people around the world who use Bitcoin today know the supply is capped, which results in more accurate price discovery for goods and services. It is also important to note that people who use bitcoin are doing so voluntarily to store their wealth and move their money.\nBitcoin Is a Revolutionary Idea With the advent of cryptocurrencies, for the first time in history, humans now have the option to choose their money. This is nothing short of revolutionary since throughout history there was always some central authority, be it the state, the church, or a banking cartel, maintaining a monopoly over money by decree, and ultimately, by force.\nComparatively, it is fiat currencies that provide no security against inflation. In fact, fiat currency supply is specifically designed to grow indefinitely as emission rate is controlled by a handful of unelected bankers through the artificial setting of interest rates.\nRubber will meet the road as more people realize they can now opt out of this system by buying Bitcoin. The good news is that people now have a choice between trusting bankers or a voluntary decentralized monetary network with no one in charge.\nWhat other myths have you heard about Bitcoin?
