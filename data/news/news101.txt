As an analogy, it’s as if a fraudster got access to the clearing records of a stock exchange and falsified a series of share transfers.\nThis is basically what happened to Bitcoin Gold. According to the website Bitcoinist , the records of a digital wallet show hackers made a series of fraudulent deposits in which the money never ended up with the recipient exchange:\n“The attacker sends a particular number of BTG tokens to an exchange, trades them for another coin and makes a withdrawal. The hacker then returns those same coins in his/her wallet, hence the double-spending problem. Thus, the attacker can spend and hold the same coins at the same time. Looking at the image above, if all 76 transactions were indeed part of the hack, then the hacker has stolen about $18 million based on the current BTG price.”\nThe Bitcoin Gold network still appears vulnerable to further such attacks. The hacker has yet to strike again, however, possibly because further attacks could trigger a massive sell-off as Bitcoin Gold holders lose faith in the integrity of the network.\nThe price of Bitcoin Gold fell slightly on news of the attack but so far there has been no sign of panic selling.\nOn Tuesday morning, a Bitcoin Gold developer acknowledged the ongoing risk in a blog post , and added there are plans to introduce a software update known as a “hard fork” that will decentralize the mining power on the network. (The blog post doesn’t state if the hard fork will restore the coins swindled from the exchanges).\nAs Quartz notes, the crisis at Bitcoin Gold represents the “ nightmare scenario ” for any cryptocurrency, and could theoretically happen to numerous other currency networks.\nWhile the threat has existed for years, the chances of it materializing appeared to diminish as more and more people joined cryptocurrency networks—which in theory makes it harder to obtain control of over half the network. But the rise of massive mining conglomerates that deploy specialized computer equipment has seen a growing centralization of mining in recent years.\nFor now, there appears to be no imminent threat of a 51% attack on Bitcoin itself—in large part because of the size of the network—but other smaller networks could be more exposed.

He has made the code public on Github .\nWhile it is exciting to see everyday payments being powered by bitcoin, there are still multiple shortcomings that make btcoin a less than ideal form of payment for small transactions.\nSmaller transactions with bitcoin currently incur massive transactions fee and take too long too process. I, for one, won’t want to wait forever just to get my candies. But Knezić says he is working on another device that will powered by Bitcoin’s Lightning Network (LN) instead.\nLightning Network, while still in nascent development, is seen as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problems. The network sits as a ‘second-layer’ on top of bitcoin’s blockchain and allows for faster and cheaper transactions. As of now, Lightning Network can support transactions of up to $150,000.\nWith increased adoption of soft fork Segwit, bitcoin is already seeing reduced transaction fees. With further implementation of Lightning Network , bitcoin will likely become suitable to be used like regular money for everyday payments like buying candies with it.

Message: 9 − = four\nSome investors think they missed out on Bitcoin (BTC) because it's too expensive to buy at $7,416.45 a coin.\nBut you don't have to buy a full bitcoin at a time…\nYou can buy fractional shares of Bitcoin based on how much you're willing to spend, and those shares will increase in value each time the price of Bitcoin climbs.\nThat means you can buy as little or as much of Bitcoin as you want and will still profit when BTC prices climb.\nFor example, if you purchase $1,000 of Bitcoin when it trades at $7,000 per coin, and the price climbs to $8,000, your original investment would be now be worth $1,100.\nWhether you just want to invest a few hundred dollars in Bitcoin or eventually want to own an entire coin, buying fractional shares is the best strategy.\nAnd now may be the perfect moment to buy the cryptocurrency, because its price is poised to soar even higher… You Can Own One Full Bitcoin Through an Accumulation Strategy\nYes, we know Bitcoin prices have plummeted from $20,000 on Dec. 17, 2017, to $7,371.31 today (May 28).\nHowever, keep in mind that BTC prices were just $963.66 on Jan. 1, 2017.\nThat's a 664.92% increase in less than two years from today's prices.\nIn fact, the price of Bitcoin is trading at a discount right now compared to where cryptocurrency experts see it reaching in a few years…\nHe didn't provide an exact date, but Standpoint Research founder Ronnie Moas believes the price of Bitcoin will eventually trade between $300,000 and $400,000, according to a December 2017 CNBC report.\nSee Why Bitcoin Is Far from Dead: Cryptocurrency legend Michael Robinson just revealed why Bitcoin could be poised for a record-breaking rebound. Before the mainstream public gets any wiser, you need to see this now .\nThat's a potential profit of up to 5,326% from today's prices.\nTech visionary John McAfee predicts Bitcoin will trade for $1 million by 2020, an astounding 13,466% gain from the price of Bitcoin today.\nIf Moas' and McAfee's predictions come true, then today's Bitcoin price will look cheap in comparison.\nThat's why any Bitcoin price dips in 2018 will allow savvy investors to own a piece of the cryptocurrency at a potentially huge discount.\nBut timing the market is impossible, which is why cryptocurrency investors can use dollar-cost averaging to get closer to owning a whole Bitcoin.\nThrough dollar-cost averaging, investors would buy the same dollar amount of BTC each month, no matter the current cost. Video\nLet's say you have a $500 monthly budget for Bitcoin investing.\nIf Bitcoin trades for $7,000 a coin, you buy $500 worth.\nIf Bitcoin trades for $6,000, you buy $500 worth.\nIf Bitcoin trades for $8,000, you buy $500 worth.\nSticking to this strategy helps investors avoid the pitfall of buying at a high and selling at a low. And it will allow you to accumulate the crypto until you own a whole bitcoin.\nAgain, we want to make sure Money Morning readers know Bitcoin should still be viewed as a very speculative investment.\nBut there's a new innovation that will be like \"adding twin turbos to the Bitcoin engine.\"\nIn fact, it could send Bitcoin to $100,000 before you know it.\nBecause of this massive profit opportunity, we're sharing the most important details on how to buy your first bitcoin, right now… How to Buy Your First Bitcoin in 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pro.moneymappress.com/m/944632/", "http://compose.mail.yahoo.com/?body=https://mney.co/2IZpoBa", "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&to&su=&body=https://mney.co/2IZpoBa"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:36:50.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e988c632ebe017df464cfa578ecca46dcb9323b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.shEfi7tPY7t7h5w6_F8OZwdV4WfUDYVwgmW0fO7exgxt7asBprwvXhnUmVDaeM36OA--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Another Bank scared.

PUBLISHED: 20:15, Tue, May 29, 2018 | UPDATED: 20:22, Tue, May 29, 2018 0\nMr Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, said it could be decades before bitcoin has a stable price.\nSpeaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Mr Greenspan said: “I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon, especially since we still have a lot of bitcoin ‘whales’ or people who are involved in bitcoin early on who have amounted a large amount stockpile.\n“That’s going to be a threat to the near-term and possibly for the long-term.\n“Over time, if we are looking at decades into the future, once the adoption rate of bitcoin is normal and has reached full market penetration, which we are nowhere near at the moment, and once you see more distribution and more liquidity in the market, I believe we can then have a much more stable price fluctuation.” Getty•Bloomberg Bitcoin price: Mati Greenspan said it could be decades before bitcoin stabilises I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon Mati Greenspan\nBitcoin hit sub-$8,000 mid-April on Friday, far below its summer peak of $9.826.\nThe erratic pricing marks a huge contrast to the bitcoin boom of late-2017 and early-2018.\nFrom October to December the value of bitcoin soared from $4,309 to $19,304 - a staggering 450% increase.\nBitcoin price is at $7,458.64 at 20:21 (BST) on Tuesday, according to Coindesk.\nDespite the falling markets towards the end of May, BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes predicted bitcoin will be at “$50,000 by the end of the year”.

continues to lose value this month and with the rise of institutional investment in the space causing bulls to make predictions\\u00a0for the end of year prices that range from optimistic to seemingly delusional. Certainly no Bull The Motley Fool’s\\u00a0Sean Williams has made his own end of 2018 prediction list from which the following is abstracted. Crypto Market Cap Will be Lower by Year’s End\nThe unstoppable crypto market in 2017 can be in part attributed to trading being done almost exclusively by retail traders who only saw profit on the upside which pushed the market cap higher and higher.\\u00a0 As access to institutional\\u00a0investors has increased through the first months of 2018 and with both the CME and CBoE listing Bitcoin futures investors can now make money on both the upside and downside of the crypto market. This should result in a steady decline of the market cap Williams predicts . It’s not exactly going out on a limb to suggest that the total market cap isn’t going to get back over $830 billion in the next six months. Bitcoin Will Lose Half of its Value\nWilliams writes that he predicted Bitcoin would fall by half at the beginning\\u00a0of the year when it was just over $14,000 and since it has twice dropped to nearly $6,000 and is currently at about $7,000. He feels confident that it will fall by half again. Unsure of what the X factor causing the price plunge will be he posits\\u00a0increased regulation in a major trading country, institutional investing, or even Bitcoin’s slow transaction\\u00a0speeds. Bitcoin Will Briefly Lose its Top Position to Another Altcoin\nCiting the emotional tendency of cryptocurrency traders, Williams writes that he will\\u00a0stick by his other new year prediction that another coin, most likely Ethereum, will bypass Bitcoin if only momentarily. With a $70 billion market cap difference between the two of them Ethereum has a long row to hoe but Williams refers to Ethereum Alliance’s 500 members and the network’s utility as assets that could push Ether to a brief number one spot. The US Will Expand Cryptocurrency Regulation\nThis is a no brainer as the Department of Justice, Securities Exchange Commission and North American Securities Administrators Association\\u00a0 have all been actively pursuing and punishing crypto and ICO related scams in the last month. In addition to this, Williams predicts that the Internal Revenue Service will increase regulation beyond ending the like-kind exchanges loophole and one of the federal regulatory bodies will increase transparency by forcing traders to verify bank accounts with exchanges, as already happening in South Korea. A Bitcoin ETF Will Come to Market\nThe question of whether a Bitcoin elctrionic traded fund (ETF) would hit the market began as soon as the CBoE offered Bitcoin futures. The SEC waylaid it when it demanded answers to 31 questions that mostly dealt with custody. Williams assumes with increased regulation in the space the ETF will happen though which platform it will follow he isn’t willing to hazard a guess.\nIn summation Williams warns of the dangers inherent when investing in cryptocurrency writing that digital coins have no metrics that can be measured outside of transaction speed and daily trading percentages. That the backbone technology of all crypto projects, the blockchain as wonderful as it’s potential maybe, is untested in the real world of business. That in-spite of all the excitement surrounding the space he is going to leave his money safely on the side which may leave the reader thinking why write about the market at all if you have no skin in the game?\n Image from Shutterstock\nThe post Five More Crypto Predictions for the Rest of 2018 appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motley fool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:14:34.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93bbfd66bd3b25b57640ee0689ba80e0fbbcd0d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmenAVg60VL85rvC15hjyKWE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin Volatility", "title_full": "Bitcoin Volatility", "published": "2018-05-29T22:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93bbfd66bd3b25b57640ee0689ba80e0fbbcd0d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmenAVg60VL85rvC15hjyKWE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Janation", "published": "2018-05-29T22:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Volatility", "text": "Quote: from: BitcoinMarketer39 on May 25, 2018, 07:38:58 PM Quote: from: Albert211994 on February 17, 2018, 04:10:42 PM What is the key factor that would totally eradicate the volatility of bitcoin?\nIs it the price? The higher the price the less likely it would be manipulated.\nOr the distribution of supply of bitcoin? More people holding bitcoin, the harder for the whale to move the price.\nWhat do you think?\nBitcoin volatility is really good because in this way traders can earn huge amount of profit by just trading and waiting for its price to decrease or increase.\nIt is good when the price is increasing but when the price is decreasing, it is not. Bitcoin's volatility is great and a bad thing but it also tells us that earning money, even though the price changes very fast, is hard to earn. There is no such thing as easy money especially these days.

Gold ( GLD ) and other real assets like silver ( SLV ) oil ( USO ), and commodities in general ( DBC ) always spike during these times in terms of the collapsing currency, protecting people's purchasing power for those who invest in them during those times. During every currency crisis since the invention of unbacked paper money, gold has always spiked in any given currency as that currency fell. Its record of successfully hedging against currency collapse is pristine.\nNow that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other blockchain cryptocurrencies have burst onto the scene, debate has been sparked in the precious metals investment community regarding what would be a better asset to hold during a currency crisis. If and when the proverbial brown stuff hits the fan, what do you want to be holding?\nOver the last several weeks, we've gotten some solid evidence that the answer, at least as of now, is gold. That doesn't mean bitcoin can't outperform gold as a safety net in a currency crisis at some point, but as of now, it's no contest. Gold wins out by a long shot.\nFirst let's get into the numbers, and then an explanation, followed by what has to change if bitcoin is going to become a true hedge in the event of a currency crisis.\nThree cases in point of currency collapses right now in emerging markets are Argentina, Turkey, and to a lesser extent Brazil. The collapses in these currencies have accelerated over the past month, with the Brazilian real ( BZF ) down 5.1%, the Turkish lira ( TRYS ) down 15.75%, and the Argentine peso taking the cake down 19.6%, all against the US dollar.\nWhile gold has by no means skyrocketed over the last month, it hasn't plummeted either. The price of gold in Turkish lira over the last month has risen 14.6%, from TRY5,348 to TRY6,127 per ounce, chart below.\nSource\nThat all but neutralizes the lira's dive against the US dollar of 15.75% over the same time period.\nIt's the same story with the Argentine peso. The price of gold in pesos has skyrocketed 17.8% over the last 30 days, from ARS27,174 to ARS31,994 per ounce, mostly neutralizing its collapse against the US dollar of 19.6%.\nFinally, gold is up 3.9% against the Brazilian real over the last 30 days, not quite neutralizing the 5.1% decline against the US dollar but coming pretty close.\nWith bitcoin though, it's a different story. The Argentine peso may be down close to 20% against the dollar this past month, but it's still outperforming bitcoin by 6.4%.\nAnd despite the lira's free fall in forex markets, it is still outperforming bitcoin over the last 30 days by 7.3%.\nSource\nAs for the real, while falling over 5% against the dollar, it has risen 16% versus bitcoin.\nNow, all this is not to say that people in distressed emerging market currencies aren't trading out their collapsing currencies for bitcoin. In some cases, they are. It's just not working. We can see this on the Local bitcoins volume charts, especially for Argentina.\nWeekly bitcoin trading volume in Argentina spiked to an all-time record $7.19 million pesos last week, far surpassing the bitcoin trading volume at its peak at $20,000 hit in December. The Argentine peso is in the worst shape of these three emerging market currencies, so this does make some sense.\nSource\nIn Turkey, while bitcoin trading volumes are not at records, there was a noticeable spike last week to the highest weekly trading levels since February. In Brazil, there was a sharp volume spike up to R$3.415M from R$1.33M the week before, a 157% increase in trading volume. It was the highest weekly volume in Brazil since the bitcoin bubble top in December.\nNote, however, that despite these volume spikes, they can barely be considered a drop in the bucket compared to global gold trading volume. The gold market is so monumentally bigger it can barely be compared at all to cryptocurrency markets.\nWhy is gold beating bitcoin as a hedge against currency collapse? Gold is currently beating out bitcoin as an inflation hedge in emerging markets, but what is important to understand is why. I believe it's because the nature of an inflation hedge is that it must be known to be extraordinarily stable. When people are looking to ditch their currencies in a hurry, and we're not talking about tech geeks and bitcoin enthusiasts here but the masses, most of whom are not comfortable with bitcoin and don't understand it at all, they go to something known to be stable for a very long time. Gold has had a relatively stable purchasing power for thousands of years. People in a currency crisis want to preserve their wealth, not speculate on a risk asset.\nNow, a bitcoin enthusiast could retort and say that bitcoin is very volatile and I'm cherry picking time frames. Look at the price of bitcoin since its founding and it's up a shmillion percent versus gold and whatever paper currency in the world you want to pick. That's true, but that's missing the point. The point isn't whether bitcoin can beat gold over the long term. If we count from bitcoin's founding it certainly has, in spades. Bitcoin can beat gold again on another random time frame, too.\nThe point is not will gold outperform all the time. The point is where will people go when their paper currencies collapse? They will go to gold, not to bitcoin, because bitcoin's value is unpredictable.\nGlobal markets have generally agreed as to what the value of gold is because gold has been around for millennia, it's familiar, and people use it for things. On the other hand, nobody really knows what the value of bitcoin is yet because the market is so new and microscopic in size compared to the market for bullion. That, and there are too many questions about bitcoin's future still to give the masses any sense of what its value will eventually settle at, generally speaking.\nWill governments outlaw bitcoin at some point? Nobody knows yet. It is still a speculative asset and won't stop being a speculative asset until and unless it reaches some kind of tight trading range for a very long period of time, like gold has. Until people have a general idea in their heads as to what a relatively stable price of bitcoin actually looks like, most people are not going to pour into bitcoin when their currencies collapse. For all they know bitcoin could collapse as well, so why turn to it?\nMaybe one day bitcoin will become a better hedge against currency collapse than gold, but that day is not today. If I had to bet whether or not bitcoin will become a stable hedge against currency collapse before the dollar collapses, I'd bet gold that it absolutely will not.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GLD.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Their ICO guidance service will be known as Inwage. Inwage Will Help Companies Raise the Maximum Funding from Their ICO\nBitwage have launched a couple of new services to add to their existing crypto payroll platform. The first is Inwage – an advisory firm to help clients creating initial coin offerings to achieve the best possible results.\nAccording to a Bitwage company blog post published earlier today:\n“Inwage leverages our experience in blockchain to build a highly secure turnkey solution for companies of all sizes to launch ICOs.”\nAs part of the Inwage service, companies will receive technical services comprising of: A complete website with options for Inwage to provide hosting. A secure signup process. KYC compliance. Payment processing. The development of necessary smart contracts. \\u00a0Auditing of existing smart contracts and website security.\nInwage are also offering clients various marketing services to boot. These have been developed with the help of a team of 16 marketers with experience targeting U.S., European, Middle Eastern, and East Asian markets. The services advertised by the blog post are: PR. Targeting of online influencers. Digital marketing. Content marketing. Social media advertising. Marketing at events.\nThe Bitwage blog post proudly reports the success of the first project they collaborated with – Moria, a company looking to tokenise investment into the extraction of precious metals. According to the blog, Moria raised $50 million – a figure that was around 40% higher than the $30 million target initially set for the token sale. The post reads:\n“In order to achieve this goal, they trusted the technical expertise and blockchain experience of InWage \\u2013 which not only advised on the ICO, but also helped with platform development, technical services, and security compliance.”\nThe second news from Bitwage is that they’ve launched support for Ethereum on their existing platform. They identified that firms who had run ICOs in the past struggled to pay their employees thanks to the difficulty many had encountered in setting up company bank accounts. Since many ICOs are created on the Ethereum network, it therefore made sense for Bitwage to extend their payroll services to support Ether too.\nBitwage have also stated that companies such as Status and Aragon had been using the service since January when the service was ‘soft launched.’\nThe Bitwage platform was initially launched in 2013 by founders John Lindsay and Jonathan Chester. They’ve spent the last couple of\\u00a0 years slowly expanding their Bitcoin payroll services across the globe. They provide the ability for employees and freelancers to receive payment directly in Bitcoin without the company itself needing to be crypto-literate. Last July, we reported on Bitwage’s successful launch in the U.K. Featured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Bitwage Launches ICO Guidance Platform Inwage and Rolls Out Ether Support appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitwage", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:16:26.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42246c77fbb8904112d6e91ba7816d0de49ec082", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCSPTtL9APKH.bNyKHPWujKHGUiVzE0xOgidt6Py9HoJ9OA6HZT9DZ_aK1hTaEcIQk3ZQTpPpLsXIlXM_ggoC1w-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "As Bitcoin slowly but steadily continues to lose", "title_full": "As Bitcoin slowly but steadily continues to lose", "published": "2018-05-29T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42246c77fbb8904112d6e91ba7816d0de49ec082", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCSPTtL9APKH.bNyKHPWujKHGUiVzE0xOgidt6Py9HoJ9OA6HZT9DZ_aK1hTaEcIQk3ZQTpPpLsXIlXM_ggoC1w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John McMahon", "published": "2018-05-29T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "As Bitcoin slowly but steadily continues to lose", "text": "As Bitcoin slowly but steadily continues to lose value this month and with the rise of institutional investment in the space causing bulls to make predictions\\u00a0for the end of year prices that range from optimistic to seemingly delusional. Certainly no Bull The Motley Fool’s\\u00a0Sean Williams has made his own end of 2018 prediction list from which the following is abstracted. \\n Crypto Market Cap Will be Lower by Year’s End \\n\nThe unstoppable crypto market in 2017 can be in part attributed to trading being done almost exclusively by retail traders who only saw profit on the upside which pushed the market cap higher and higher.\\u00a0 As access to institutional\\u00a0investors has increased through the first months of 2018 and with both the CME and CBoE listing Bitcoin futures investors can now make money on both the upside and downside of the crypto market. This should result in a steady decline of the market cap Williams predicts . It’s not exactly going out on a limb to suggest that the total market cap isn’t going to get back over $830 billion in the next six months. \\n Bitcoin Will Lose Half of its Value \\n\nWilliams writes that he predicted Bitcoin would fall by half at the beginning\\u00a0of the year when it was just over $14,000 and since it has twice dropped to nearly $6,000 and is currently at about $7,000. He feels confident that it will fall by half again. Unsure of what the X factor causing the price plunge will be he posits\\u00a0increased regulation in a major trading country, institutional investing, or even Bitcoin’s slow transaction\\u00a0speeds. \\n Bitcoin Will Briefly Lose its Top Position to Another Altcoin \\n\nCiting the emotional tendency of cryptocurrency traders, Williams writes that he will\\u00a0stick by his other new year prediction that another coin, most likely Ethereum, will bypass Bitcoin if only momentarily. With a $70 billion market cap difference between the two of them Ethereum has a long row to hoe but Williams refers to Ethereum Alliance’s 500 members and the network’s utility as assets that could push Ether to a brief number one spot. \\n The US Will Expand Cryptocurrency Regulation \\n\nThis is a no brainer as the Department of Justice, Securities Exchange Commission and North American Securities Administrators Association\\u00a0 have all been actively pursuing and punishing crypto and ICO related scams in the last month. In addition to this, Williams predicts that the Internal Revenue Service will increase regulation beyond ending the like-kind exchanges loophole and one of the federal regulatory bodies will increase transparency by forcing traders to verify bank accounts with exchanges, as already happening in South Korea. \\n A Bitcoin ETF Will Come to Market \\n\nThe question of whether a Bitcoin elctrionic traded fund (ETF) would hit the market began as soon as the CBoE offered Bitcoin futures. The SEC waylaid it when it demanded answers to 31 questions that mostly dealt with custody. Williams assumes with increased regulation in the space the ETF will happen though which platform it will follow he isn’t willing to hazard a guess. \\n\nIn summation Williams warns of the dangers inherent when investing in cryptocurrency writing that digital coins have no metrics that can be measured outside of transaction speed and daily trading percentages. That the backbone technology of all crypto projects, the blockchain as wonderful as it’s potential maybe, is untested in the real world of business. That in-spite of all the excitement surrounding the space he is going to leave his money safely on the side which may leave the reader thinking why write about the market at all if you have no skin in the game? \\n\n \\n Image from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post Five More Crypto Predictions for the Rest of 2018 appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motley fool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:00:52.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "acef2170f85bed84b2cb51a24a1b2b2ad3aa7ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYAQc2MiiO4Wg8YzCIBsi.E7", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Bch = bitcoin", "title_full": "/biz/ - Bch = bitcoin - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-29T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "acef2170f85bed84b2cb51a24a1b2b2ad3aa7ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYAQc2MiiO4Wg8YzCIBsi.E7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-29T21:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bch = bitcoin", "text": "Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:10:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3165bf646d6519feab8df93ac09ae5346a747baa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7VJHU3K6AEA98ahBV0jE_3ojxY36epu9Zu93.i96nL1nop26_idvYvPM70Yxj4FFhtJF.3fwpcFcC_VB1B31xrrg7g2QyeQzm", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "\"Bitcoin is the future....

By Andrew Koubaridis for news.com.au 29th May 2018, 7:48 pm Updated: 29th May 2018, 7:48 pm DOCTORS have warned the recent explosion in Bitcoin trading is fuelling a new breed of gambling addicts.\nThey say online trading of the cryptocurrency is a form of high-stakes gambling which can totally consume participants. Getty - Contributor Doctors have warned Bitcoin is fuelling a new generation of gambling addicts\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were “a sub-type of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction”.\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n\"It is a form of gambling. People gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it’s mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.\n\"People dive in because they don’t want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is (cryptocurrency) trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm. MIKE SEGAR Dr Mark Griffiths warned trading addictions are akin to a gambling problem\n\"I think it’s an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That’s what a compulsive gambler wants.\"\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and he predicted there would be a rise in the number of Bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n\"It provides excitement and an escape from reality... It’s a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.\"\nIt was relatively easy to start Bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular. Las Vegas strip club now takes Bitcoin so punters can tip dancers without the wife finding out\n“It’s relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don’t know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it’s relatively easy.”\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system, and the patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n“They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don’t realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.” Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort says he would have made $50billion on 'scam' bitcoin MOST READ IN NEWS Wales set to ban smoking OUTSIDE hospitals, schools and in playgrounds squishie danger Girl, 9, 'suffers chemical burns' after Squishie toy bursts in her hands in the death house I was dragged from my cell to be executed when the unthinkable happened BUMPER BROOD Britain's largest family about to become even BIGGER with baby 21 on the way ROBINSON CAGED Far-right activist Tommy Robinson jailed for 13 months for contempt of court RUNWAY TRAGEDY Brit traveller, 30, dies after falling from a plane on to runway in Turkey\nCastle Craig Hospital in Scotland has now launched a program aimed specifically at people who are hooked on trading digital currencies like Bitcoin.\nThe hospital specialises in treating addictions and had been asked to help people with cryptocurrency problems.\nIt has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.

Euro Faces Repeat Politics\nData uploaded to social media by eToro analyst Mati Greenspan shows that despite its downturn in May, Bitcoin is still 7% higher than it was April 1, while the euro has dropped 6%.\n“Draw your own conclusions,” Greenspan commented. Just for the fun of it. Here's a graph comparing Bitcoin to the Euro since the beginning of April.\nGreen is BTC = +7%\n— Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 28, 2018\nWhile acknowledging the comparison was “just for fun,” the EUR/BTC comparison makes for surprising reading, while the underlying motivation for the euro’s abrupt descent points to far more serious future implications.\nItaly will head towards fresh elections in 2018, but the results will be anything but an improvement, former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned May 28.\nThe refusal of president Sergio Mattarella to appoint eurosceptic Paolo Savona as finance minister will give strength to some of the more virulent populist voices in Italian politics, Varoufakis warned, notably Northern League leader Matteo Salvini:\nIn short, (Mattarella) fell right into Mr Salvini’s trap. The formation of another ‘technical’ government, under a former IMF apparatchik, is a fantastic gift to Mr Salvini. Crypto Commentators Smell Blood\nThe uncertainty has so far given a boost to Bitcoin price today as news our of Italy is beginning to resemble previous events such as the Cypriot bank bailout and Greek debt crisis .\nThe susceptibility of euro for cryptocurrency commentators nonetheless remains a preoccupation.\n“For a fiat currency, this is a huge dump,” WhalePanda claimed in a Twitter debate on the currency’s crash. Damn this coin has taking a beating the last couple of days… Oh wait that's the $EURUSD chart. #FiatRekt Good thing I'm hedged in #Bitcoin\n— WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) May 29, 2018\nItaly’s stocks meanwhile continue to bear the brunt of financial panic, with two-year yields seeing their biggest one-day move in history, ZeroHedge reports , describing the event as a “full-blown liquidation avalanche.”\nThe knock-on effects reached Germany, where Deutsche Bank’s stock dipped below €10 for the first time since the bank faced a crisis of its own in 2016.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s performance versus the euro?

Power authorities are concerned about Bitcoin's energy use; how does it stack up against growing bud? May 29 2018, 6:30pm Image: Shutterstock, pngimg.com. Composition: Author\nIt’s no secret that mining cryptocurrency—a largely automated process that uses powerful computers to find a specific hash value that verifies the next block of transactions—uses up a lot of electricity. Like, a lot a lot .\nNow cryptocurrency miners are gobbling up the cheapest electricity they can find, which is concerning to municipalities worried about electricity rates rising for everybody due to the activity of a few nerds. The city of Plattsburgh in New York State recently opted to temporarily ban new Bitcoin mines while it conducts research on energy usage, and in Washington State power authorities are following electricity spikes only to find apartments full of humming servers mining digital money.\nThe latter report led to some jokers on social media gabbing about how , if growing marijuana were completely legal, police might raid a house expecting to find an unregistered Bitcoin mine and instead find a bunch of totally fine pot.\nIndeed, electricity consumption records are an investigative tool for police trying to bust grow ops and utilities often voluntarily give information to the police. Last year, a Canadian court ruled that police must get a warrant before obtaining hydro records , but did not exclude the evidence collected using that information even though it was obtained without a warrant.\nNow, this got me thinking: How much energy does it take to mine Bitcoin versus growing cannabis, anyway?\nHow much energy does it take to grow weed? According to a 2014 report produced by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC)—an organization that provides energy and environment planning for Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington—the majority of a grow op’s electricity costs go towards lighting (38 percent) and air conditioning (21 percent), with CO2 injection, dehumidifying, and so on making up the rest.\nAccording to that 2014 NPCC report, indoor cannabis production can consume 4,000 to 6,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy per kilogram of product, or just over two pounds. In January of 2018 the CBC, reporting on Canada’s booming pot business, reported that it takes about 2,000 kWh to produce one pound of product, which is about the same as NPCC’s estimate.

In the New York area , electricity cost 19.8 cents per kWh in February. In that region, burning through 5,000 kWh will run you just under $1,000. For that amount of energy, you could power five average American homes (which consume roughly 900 Kwh per month) for a month. Or, you could grow one kilogram of pot (35 ounces) which adds up to roughly $12,000 USD worth of dank.\nHow much energy does it take to mine Bitcoin? Based on price, the closest analog to one kilogram of pot ($12,000) in Bitcoin is two whole bitcoins—currently valued at $14,800. Let’s look at how much energy it takes to generate two new bitcoins as a reward from solving a block of transaction data.\nAccording to an extremely generous estimate from Alex de Vries over at Digiconomist (because it assumes every miner is using the most efficient hardware ), the whole Bitcoin network uses 32 terawatt hours annually, which is 32 billion kilowatt hours. Assuming an average of one block being solved every 10 minutes, that’s roughly 52,560 blocks of Bitcoin data solved in a year. After the total energy use of the network per year is divided by the amount of Bitcoin blocks found, we get the very rough estimate of 608,828 kWh used up for every solved block of Bitcoin data.\nOne solved block of Bitcoin data currently generates 12.5 bitcoins for the miner. If we divide the amount of kilowatts it takes to solve a block by that number, and multiply it by two, we see that generating two bitcoins—currently worth $14,800—uses just under 100,000 kWh of electricity, which at consumer rates in the New York area would cost roughly $19,000. At rates that industrial cryptocurrency miners prefer (say, two cents per kWh), that would cost around $2,000. This amount of electricity could power two dozen average American homes for a month; that’s an entire small community. *\nAll of this math is extremely rough and of the back-of-envelope variety, but the inescapable conclusion is that it takes way more electricity—like, twenty times more—to generate an equivalent value in bitcoins than it does in cannabis.\nSo maybe mining bitcoins isn’t the new growing weed; it’s worse.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nwcouncil.org/sites/default/files/p7_5.pdf", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cannabis-pot-marijuana-weed-electricity-engineering-1.4498349", "https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3", "https://www.postandcourier.com/news/marijuana-bust-shines-light-on-utilities/article_f63a8bed-9a43-5429-aaef-99f7eb0f71f0.html", "https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/news-release/averageenergyprices_newyorkarea.htm", "https://www.seattletimes.com/business/bitcoin-backlash-as-miners-suck-up-electricity-stress-power-grids-in-central-washington/", "https://twitter.com/bentorkington/status/1000913882339098625", "https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/08/15/police-need-search-warrant-to-get-hydro-records-in-grow-op-cases-appeal-court-rules.html", "https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/", "https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-mining-more-polluting-than-gold-mining"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "plattsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york state", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:40:28.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1ede0698ff60f674e87fed69f539fb7775a66fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNHagZcf5W7Hu5uccV.3qTO0OpNq3G1s6fUimOwhj4xYPs_E3pKmedkqH71FyWY0UmZo6A5K2tL_efcdb_mk2ZBOOTKp7HX5XFROJQL5hDpw--", "site_full": "mycriptocurrency.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://mycriptocurrency.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The rise of the digital currency", "title": "How Wired magazine lost $100,000 in bitcoin", "title_full": "How Wired magazine lost $100,000 in bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T21:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1ede0698ff60f674e87fed69f539fb7775a66fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNHagZcf5W7Hu5uccV.3qTO0OpNq3G1s6fUimOwhj4xYPs_E3pKmedkqH71FyWY0UmZo6A5K2tL_efcdb_mk2ZBOOTKp7HX5XFROJQL5hDpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "oyebiyi david (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T21:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Wired magazine lost $100,000 in bitcoin", "text": "Louise Matsakis of Wired magazine writes about how the publication garnered about $100,000 in bitcoin in 2013 after receiving a mining device and then promptly destroyed how to retrieve them. Matsakis writes, “Wired’s miner essentially won the Bitcoin math lottery a couple of times, allowing it to generate a little over 12 coins into the network. Then, the staff had to figure out what to do with them. “We had a very long conversation, over several weeks, about what to do with the money,” says Michael Calore, a senior editor at Wired who has been at the magazine since 2006. Some staff members argued the Bitcoin should be donated, or set aside for a charitable purpose in the future. Others said it had to be destroyed permanently. What was agreed upon was that the money shouldn’t just site there, because it could influence how the magazine reported on cryptocurrencies. “I said we had to dump it and donate the money to charity soonest or we wouldn’t be able to cover Bitcoin,” says Adam Rogers, a deputy editor at Wired. “We had to disclose it in every story.” Eventually, it was decided that the private key, which unlocks the Bitcoin wallet and allows the funds to be spent, should be destroyed. “We talked about donating it to a journalism institution, or setting it aside for a scholarship. But we decided that if we gained any benefit from it at all, it would color our future coverage of bitcoin,” says Calore. “So we just destroyed the key, knowing full well that it could eventually be worth six or seven figures.” Read more here ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "louise matsakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael calore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matsakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam rogers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:30:01.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2505155e3f21073c049e831120dd604e592ef1ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW8maxLL.7DYC1_PlEYGGa0A-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T21:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2505155e3f21073c049e831120dd604e592ef1ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW8maxLL.7DYC1_PlEYGGa0A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T21:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 29.

It's a poor store of value due to instability in the price, it's an even poorer currency for the same reason. When he says Bitcoin doesn't solve any real world problems, it's acknowledging the reality as it is right now. The best you can say about Bitcoin is it has potential to change things, but nobody who needs to conduct day to day commerce is taking Bitcoin seriously. To the extent it's used at all, it's to appeal to the niche part of the market that wants to use it for transactions. Bitcoin hasn't proved any ability to be the new gold, the best you can say again is that it has potential, but it's much more of a speculative asset than a store of value.\nBitcoin can't even hold it's value for an hour, the notion that it's more stable than the USD is idiotic. Sorry, there's no sense in sugarcoating that. It's absolutely absurd.\nNo elite prefers the gold standard because the fiat standard is what made them wealthy. The gold standard was abandoned because it constrained the economy by limiting debt-fueled growth. It wasn't until the abandonment of the gold standard that you got this explosion of ultra wealthy elites, and since the abandonment of the gold standard, the wealth accumulation by the top .1% has really accelerated relative to the rest of the populace. It defies logic they would abandon the system that created their wealth to a larger degree than the gold standard would have allowed, so if you want to sell that, you need to provide some substantiation, because it's not a compelling theory.\nIf the top elites dislike the gold standard so much, why did every gold standard get abandoned only when the elites were about to run out of gold?\n'Fiat money' might have created a lot of the wealth of the elites of today, but the system is also much more unstable than the gold standard days, and on the whole less desirable from the top elites' point of view.\nBitcoin hasn't achieved a stable exchange rate against fiat money, yet. It will likely go up a lot more (if with a lot of turbulence) before it does. No, it will probably never serve as a unit of account or means of exchange (the trustless blockchain arhitecture makes those impossible pretty much from the start.) But store-of-value is money's most important function.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:48:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d5aaa09eca5c7d967a1f2c333d52f9a80b3d268", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf380sJnrirJuQ3m_5R9g38piMMiybX_BWAbNT4.IzRAB3AGGtIz0zb.V65VI88..cjBD2yHwm8U7K", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Bitcoin is stable.

For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

That is no wonder as all teams have registered their ICOs while branding their ledgers, assets, and platforms in order to make the rights to these assets visible to the eye of the public. Now, Bitcoin has been a long-term favorite of many crypto enthusiasts and programmers, however, the person who registered Bitcoin seems to have nothing in common with the blockchain industry or Bitcoin.\nWho Registered Bitcoin?\nEverything started out when a merchant on the well-known online shop, called Etsy, was notified that he will be pursuit by the law in case he continues to sell t-shirts with the name Bitcoin on it.\nThe merchant got a letter that stated that IP-Holdings will be legally pursuing him in the following period unless the merchant doesn’t pull the t-shirts out of the sale on Etsy. The t-shirts were being sold to Bitcoin fans and had Bitcoin logo and name on it.\nIt seems that the mentioned merchant did have to stop with his offer on Etsy as IP-Holdings, which is a London-based company that doesn’t have anything to do with Bitcoin, has registered Bitcoin as their trademark and branded the coin as the original property of IP-Holdings.\nOne is for certain and that is that whoever stands behind the IP-Holdings, can’t possibly be the father of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who should be the only rightful owner of the first digital coin ever to be issued.\nHowever, it is a commonly known case that no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and those who might hold some information are keeping their silence for 10 years already.\nSo, it is less likely that we are going to find out who stands behind this alias any time soon.\nBut, as Satoshi Nakamoto is nowhere to be found, and has no interest in branding his own creation, it seems that anyone could have done that instead of them.\nIP-Holdings seem to be one of the rare companies that made it in this devour.\nThat means that the brand of Bitcoin is now an official trademark of IP-Holdings, in accordance with the information found at the British Intellectual Property Office.\nThere you can find the information that Bitcoin is registered under the number UK00003279106, which means that the name of Bitcoin officially belongs to the London-based IP-Holdings.\nWhether the company is lawfully entitled to trademark this brand despite the acceptance from the British Intellectual Property Office, still remains to be discovered.\nBefore this company has successfully registered Bitcoin as their own trademark in December 2017, two more companies, one based in London and the other in Russia, tried to list Bitcoin as their trademark back in 2015, but have failed in doing so, since their request was denied.\nSo, why IP-Holdings stand for the first company ever that has made it with successfully registering Bitcoin as their trademark?\nThe Bitcoin Foundation replied to this case that they believe that the name of Bitcoin shouldn’t be owned by anyone, which is in the spirit of the decentralized nature of this digital asset.\nRegardless of their opinion, IP-Holdings are sending letters to anyone using the brand of Bitcoin, threatening with lawsuits and claiming their rights.\nIt does make you mad unless of course, you have anything to do with IP-Holdings.\nHow is Bitcoin doing at the Current Moment?\nBitcoin seems to be hitting low for the past couple of days, especially now when we can see it falling below the price of 7.500$ per one unit, which is probably the lowest of BTC we have seen in a while.\nStill ranked as the top coin according to the global coin ranking list, BTC is currently dropping due to the most recent market trend, while it is trading in the red.\nFollowing the latest change in the market, Bitcoin can be traded at the price of 7.152$ per one unit, which is obviously still far from its all-time high of over 20.000$ per one unit, which also marked the golden period for this crypto.\nNow, for a reason still unknown, we can see it falling far below its all-time high while the dropping is interrupted only with an occasional bounce off that doesn’t last more than 24 hours as per the usual case in the last couple of weeks.\nDo you believe Bitcoin will be able to retain its old glory when it comes to its price in the market and the market demand?\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The trademark holder has allegedly served an Etsy seller with a cease and desist order for using the BTC logo on his themed T-shirts. Bitcoin™– It’s Official\nA.B.C. IPHoldings South West, LLC, a UK-based company and subsidiary of Monopolip LTD, has managed to secure a successful trademark registration for the term “Bitcoin” in three different asset classes as it follows: Class 25 – Clothing, footwear, and headgear. Class 32 – Fruit beverages, fruit juices, syrups, beers, mineral and aerated waters and other non-alcoholic beverages. Class 33 – Alcoholic beverages (excluding beers).\nThe owner of Monopolip LTD is Kjell Halvor Landsverk, a Norwegian entrepreneur. Despite the fact that there’s not a lot of information surrounding the company or its owner, registering the “Bitcoin” trademark does seem to fall in line with its nature of business dealings.\nPublic information on UK’s Company House official website shows that one of the two main fields of expertise of Monopolip LTD is “Leasing of intellectual property and similar products, except copyright works.” What is more, the company does seem to have applied for another potentially interesting trademark for the term “Westworld,” which is currently a popular HBO series. Swinging the Gavel of Litigation\nDespite the fact that the “Bitcoin” trademark has been approved and entered in the official registrar on April 13 th , 2018, it seems that the IP holder doesn’t plan to lose any time. A Reddit thread popped on May 25 th , a little over a month after the trademark had been registered, posted by a person who says that he has been served with a cease and desist order to refrain from furthering his conduct.\nThe user says that he has been selling T-shirts on Etsy. Some of his items seem to be related to cryptocurrency and Bitcoin , carrying the BTC logo on them.\nWhat is more, the user has attached a redacted version of the letter, outlining the demands of the trademark holder, which includes surrendering all trademark-infringing stock and profits made to the trademark holder.\nThere’s no further clarity on the matter and it remains questionable how a seemingly unknown company has managed to land a trademark on one of the hottest, mainstream terms in the last year. Community reaction has definitely been on the side of the Etsy seller, which is fitting due to the decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency .\nDo you think “Bitcoin” is a term which should be eligible for trademark registration?

However, some fear it is now in danger of getting left behind by the hottest emerging asset class – cryptocurrency. One of the main reasons for this appears to be the dominance of the big banks over the UK economy.\nAlso Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future Banks Hindering Progress\nDespite having a thriving fintech startups scene, an established trading ecosystem and a leading role in the traditional fiat currencies market, London appears to be missing the boat with regards to the rush of institutional money flowing into crypto finance. Locations such as Tokyo, Chicago, New York and even San Francisco are taking the lead with regards to regulated platforms, OTC and hedge funds, as well as exchange-traded derivatives such as futures. And many people in the industry believe this is mainly due to the outsize influence that the banks have in the City.\n“Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs trader and current CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency market maker, told FT . “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX trading venue which recently announced a physical cryptocurrency exchange dedicated to serving just institutional clients, expects UK banks would only join the market next year. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he explained. Not Too Late?\nThere are also factors that support London’s position in the crypto market, such as CFD brokers like IG Group and Plus500 achieving success with retail traders as well as Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those that think that the matter is overstated.\n“The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance. These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to news.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset financial & cryptocurrency trading exchange.\nAnees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.”\nHow should London ensure that the crypto revolution does not pass it by?

However, some fear it is now in danger of getting left behind by the hottest emerging asset class – cryptocurrency. One of the main reasons for this appears to be the dominance of the big banks over the UK economy.\nAlso Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future Banks Hindering Progress\nDespite having a thriving fintech startups scene, an established trading ecosystem and a leading role in the traditional fiat currencies market, London appears to be missing the boat with regards to the rush of institutional money flowing into crypto finance. Locations such as Tokyo, Chicago, New York and even San Francisco are taking the lead with regards to regulated platforms, OTC and hedge funds, as well as exchange-traded derivatives such as futures. And many people in the industry believe this is mainly due to the outsize influence that the banks have in the City.\n“Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs trader and current CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency market maker, told FT . “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX trading venue which recently announced a physical cryptocurrency exchange dedicated to serving just institutional clients, expects UK banks would only join the market next year. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he explained. Not Too Late?\nThere are also factors that support London’s position in the crypto market, such as CFD brokers like IG Group and Plus500 achieving success with retail traders as well as Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those that think that the matter is overstated.\n“The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance. These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to news.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset financial & cryptocurrency trading exchange.\nAnees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.”\nHow should London ensure that the crypto revolution does not pass it by?

These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to news.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset financial & cryptocurrency trading exchange.\nAnees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.”\nHow should London ensure that the crypto revolution does not pass it by?

However, some fear it is now in danger of getting left behind by the hottest emerging asset class – cryptocurrency. One of the main reasons for this appears to be the dominance of the big banks over the UK economy.\nAlso Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future\nBanks Hindering Progress Despite having a thriving fintech startups scene, an established trading ecosystem and a leading role in the traditional fiat currencies market, London appears to be missing the boat with regards to the rush of institutional money flowing into crypto finance. Locations such as Tokyo, Chicago, New York and even San Francisco are taking the lead with regards to regulated platforms, OTC and hedge funds, as well as exchange-traded derivatives such as futures. And many people in the industry believe this is mainly due to the outsize influence that the banks have in the City.\n“Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs trader and current CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency market maker, told FT . “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX trading venue which recently announced a physical cryptocurrency exchange dedicated to serving just institutional clients, expects UK banks would only join the market next year. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he explained.\nNot Too Late? There are also factors that support London’s position in the crypto market, such as CFD brokers like IG Group and Plus500 achieving success with retail traders as well as Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those that think that the matter is overstated.\n“The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance.
