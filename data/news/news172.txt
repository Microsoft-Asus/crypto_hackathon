Hello, I have watched this video and I will never be the same again.\nBy now I’m assuming we all have a fundamental understanding of what Bitcoin is: digital money regulated and distributed with encryption techniques, stored on a ledger independent of a centralised bank.

The Bitcoin Cash network has been increasing trader confidence since its developers began implementing infrastructural improvements. Brian Kelly has suggested that investors buy Bitcoin Cash for the potential gains as BCH is a must own cryptocurrency and offers an attractive entry point.\nBCH miner’s strategy to support BCH developers and professional programmers enhanced Kelly’s optimism in BCH coin future fundamentals.\nIn the fund, miners are “going to take some of the rewards they get from mining and put it in a fund to build stuff on top of bitcoin cash,” Kelly said . “That’s how blockchains gain value,” he added.\nBitcoin Cash miners on Saturday talk about a new plan to provide funds for the development of its blockchain technology. They are planning to donate 1% to 5% of their rewards for the BCH network development.\nSeveral other industry experts have previously highlighted their confidence in the upside potential of Bitcoin Cash. Indeed, Roger Veer – known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” has notoriously predicted that Bitcoin Cash will replace Bitcoin from its market-dominating position.\nThe Bitcoin expert stated : “The economic path that Bitcoin Cash is on is the one that led to Bitcoin’s original success…I’m incredibly bullish on Bitcoin Cash for the same reasons I was bullish on Bitcoin back in 2011.” Bitcoin Cash Lovers are Expecting Big Things\nBears are calling Brian Kelly’s positive remarks, a promotion scheme. However, Bitcoin Cash lovers are enjoying his predictions. In fact, they are showing confidence in BCH management after the recent network enhancements.\nThey believe Bitcoin Cash has performed better than Bitcoin in the last couple of months and it will extend the momentum in the days to come.

WealthManagement.com Staff | May 22, 2018\nVanguard Chief Economist Joe Davis has been a long-time Bitcoin skeptic, writing on Vanguard's website last February that he would not be surprised to see the value of the crypto coin fall to zero. Now his post has been reprinted, this time as a paid-for post on ETF.com , giving the view renewed currency in the digital echo chamber. “The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak,” he writes. “Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices.” Instead, crypto prices depend more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use. “The speculation creates volatility that, ironically, undermines their value as a currency,” he writes. While Davis is bearish on cryptocurrencies, he does see value in the underlying blockchain technology. “We’ll likely see blockchain adopted by governments and enterprises for specific purposes in the coming decades,” he writes. “As innovation quickens and competition increases, the majority of networks (and their associated cryptocurrencies) may be rendered obsolete,” much like tulip bulbs in 17th century Holland.\nA Retirement Cost No One Talks About\nThe Society of Actuaries’ Committee on Post Retirement Needs and Risks published an annual report called Post-Retirement Experiences of Individuals 85+ Years Old and while most findings aren’t surprising, one survey result might be, even to advisors. When participants were asked how big an impact certain events had on finances in the last five years, one category finished neck and neck with medical expenses: rising utility costs. For retirees that were at least 85 years old, 23 percent said utility costs had a “major impact” on their finances, compared to 19 percent for medical costs, the headline expense in retirement that wealth managers and others say workers need to save more for.\nCrypto Miner Draws Some Heat, Into His Bathtub Image via Reddit\nOne at-home cryptocurrency miner has used the heat given off by his mining circuitry to run hot water into his bathtub, reports Motherboard . The miner, who goes by the name “Lee” and reportedly works in IT in Alabama, said he could even imagine a mining system heating a swimming pool. If left running all day, the test mining system he designed heated the water in his tub to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, “dangerously hot” for a bath, he said. Today’s cryptocurrency miners are using application specific integrated circuits to “mine” for digital paydirt, a process that consumes large amounts of electricity. By doubling his mining operation as a water heater, Lee was able to cut his heating bill and increase the profit margin on his mining operation with the cost savings.

Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money.\nPutting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate. And while novel ideas by communist and technocratic thinkers have failed, the Euro – which was devised to help unite former warring nations – is still around. Revolutionary Zeal Is Not Enough Nobel Prize Laureate Robert J. Shiller\nAfter reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: “Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\n“And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,” he concluded.\nWhether it’s true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.\nWhat should the bitcoin community make of the professor’s observations?

However, a mysterious story is not enough to ensure the digital asset class' longevity, feels economics Nobel Award winner Robert Shiller.\n'Devotees' Emotionally Invested in Digital Assets On May 21, 2018, Shiller's post titled \" The Old Allure of New Money \" compared cryptocurrencies to a number of monetary fads and experiments that took place in the past, with the economist terming bitcoin a \"failed currency experiment.\"\nSince coming into existence in 2009, Bitcoin has drawn several critics from different quarters, and has spearheaded the rise of a whole new asset class that is carefully studied and scrutinized by the world's governments'. At the time of writing, there are upwards of 2,000 cryptocurrencies , each of which represents the public's' monetary or emotional investments.\nHowever, Shiller questioned the movement, which has yet remained undeterred regardless of official warnings , widespread scams , and investor losses.\nRobert Shiller at a Conference . Source : CNBC\nThe economist noted that money is the value we ascertain to it, with the dollar nothing more than a \"piece of paper\" that goes around the world. However, he observed that over different periods in history, various attempts to recreate money have been attempted, coupled with a compelling narrative, only to fail drastically.\nIn his post, Shiller quoted Viviana Zelizer book \"The Social Meaning of Money:\"\n\"Despite the common sense idea that 'a dollar is a dollar is a dollar,' everywhere we look people are constantly creating different kinds of money. Many of these innovations generate real excitement, at least for a while.\"\nShiller Refers To Failed Concepts From the 80's and 90's Shiller explained a few of currency novelties from the 1800's to undermine cryptocurrencies. He first referred to the \" Cincinnati Time Store ,\" opened by Josiah Warner in 1827, that relied on \" labor notes \" and sold merchandise in units of hours of work, which resembled paper money. For the next three years, the labour notes were seen as a \"testament to the importance of working people,\" until the shop shut down in 1830.\nShiller then cited Robert Owen's National Equitable Labor Exchange in 1832, which also relied on \" time money \" as a form of currency. However, the enterprise met with failure too, and it was proved that the proof-of-labor concept could not equal physical stores-of-value, such as gold or silver.\nFinally, Shiller cites economist John Pease Norton's effort in 1932, who proposed an electricity-backed dollar, instead of gold. However, the innovative concept failed to answer a single question: A good reason for choosing electricity over other commodities?\nFacing the Nobel Heat To conclude, Shiller points out that each of the pasts' experiments, and now Bitcoin, stem from a singular narrative of having a technologically advanced, \"revolutionizing\" transfer-of-value. However, the micro-revolutions remain short-lived:\n\"The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\"\nThe post Nobel-Winning Economist Robert Shiller Terms Bitcoin a \"Failed Currency Experiment\" appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T05:39:44.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1294dde991f0eb9098feb5853b5ffe43cad14f6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSy4GdW3JV2_tvh59_1a5jA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin will be used as a donation to the church", "title_full": "Bitcoin will be used as a donation to the church", "published": "2018-05-23T05:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.076, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1294dde991f0eb9098feb5853b5ffe43cad14f6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSy4GdW3JV2_tvh59_1a5jA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mokong11", "published": "2018-05-23T05:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will be used as a donation to the church", "text": "Donating bitcoin in the church is a good idea but if I we're you I will priority donate bitcoin to the street children and beggar because they are most really need help compare to church.

If the Saudis don’t want a higher oil price? 2) The rising yield on the 10 year bond and how it is now over 3%! Erik thinks that if yields continue to rise on the 10 year bond, that it will eventually crack the stock market and cause a large correction or crash. 3) Tracking error on VIX ETFs and also how the leveraged short volatility trade has expanded far beyond just stocks now! 4) How will the Fed be able to sell ~$600 billion in asset sales via its QT program AND the US Treasury also will need to sell $1.2 trillion in additional US Treasuries in the near future. Who will be the buyer? Will pension funds and insurance companies be forced to buy? 5) A conversation about Bitcoin, block chain technology and crypto currencies in general. Erik thinks Bitcoin will be outdated and old tech (like the Wright Flyer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_… is to airplanes in the near future) and he thinks the same thing about other crypto currencies that rely on proof of work.\nCommit to tipping us monthly for our hard work creating high level, thought proving content about investing and the economy https://www.patreon.com/wallstformainst", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_…", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer", "https://www.patreon.com/wallstformainst", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G30yUS4CUnM"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "digital curre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jason burack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik townsend", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T05:43:04.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddc5058c757af4ae2917846e18129a5ae30d6954", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPqau47oXVVnjQSZo2Fo22HYWyLTQwNXDMRYKPRECbRZkdFHpZlwEhFsEwKw.HHWTY1KIrYJh6OJ8ycqDQ6h7Bm0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "AKARI-PAGES v0.1 released!

Immersed in the new technological trends, it is a faithful follower of Blockchain technology, but not Bitcoin.\n“There are many people who say that the future of currencies is Bitcoin because it is a decentralized currency that no government can control, but I have a somewhat non-conformist opinion about it. I do not believe so much in Bitcoin, but I do believe a lot in the technology that is behind Bitcoin, the Blockchain, because it is an innovative technology and very useful for different cases “.\n“I believe in the Blockchain a lot because it is an innovative and useful technology,” he said.\nIn this sense, Felsing explains that the Blockchain or Blockchain is useful, for example, “For Smart Contracts, where a solution is the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The Blockchain technology can also be the solution to replace the “Swift” protocol or for transfers of money between countries because it is done faster and more economically. There are already several banks that are experimenting with the Ripple cryptocurrency (XRP), such as Santander Bank, of Spain. And there are other very interesting cases. ”\nThe economist and businessman stresses that Bitcoin is talked about because everything started with that cryptocurrency, but that does not mean that it is the “panacea for all the problems that can be solved through the technology behind Bitcoin”, that is, the Blockchain. What I do observe is that Bitcoin is losing margin with respect to other innovative cryptocurrencies that specialize in solving specific problems. So, personally, I do not see a great future for Bitcoin.\n“I do not see a great future for Bitcoin,” he said.\nIn reference to this, Felsing says that paying through Bitcoin is complicated for the majority of the population: “for an average person it is very complicated, slow and possibly insecure. Also, if we talk about Bitcoin as a currency there is something that does not have and that very important, stability. If today you earn a Bitcoin and tomorrow is worth half it is not valid as currency. ”\n“For the majority of the population, Paying with Bitcoin is complicated, slow and possibly insecure, “he said.\nFelsing’s opinions against Bitcoin are in line with the latest statements by Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, who recently stated in an interview for CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that he will bet against Bitcoin if the opportunity arises. . Gates expresses his support for the Blockchain technology because it eliminates the need for an external intermediary, such as a bank, but is a detractor of Bitcoin as well as billionaire Warren Buffet, who has called Bitcoin “matarratas” and considers it a product that will never generate any value.\nFor Gates, virtual currency is one of the “most crazy and speculative things” in history due to its volatility. Both Buffet and Gates are united against Bitcoin, while PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel thinks the opposite. The former economic advisor to Trump believes that Bitcoin has qualities even to replace the value of gold, an appreciation that does not share with other cryptoactive for “uncertainty in the market.” Related", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fernando f. felsing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felsing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T05:05:09.061+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd51a9d0281a65750f4ee77dd3d542d1a369009f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8rBmJcD77ELu6zrVjcbptQKwqaXVb93muaTsR8JHc4A0vubhkn2.LBqgD5O6N8ebWlO7FiXuj26LU8Nr3hzdEPTi_4AFfXHzRyAOTmSMk3GEtdCMEkjP", "site_full": "blog.successwithagile.com", "site": "successwithagile.com", "site_section": "http://blog.successwithagile.com/index.php/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Agile Blog", "title": "Bitcoin Savings Account from LedgerX!", "title_full": "Bitcoin Savings Account from LedgerX!", "published": "2018-05-23T05:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd51a9d0281a65750f4ee77dd3d542d1a369009f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8rBmJcD77ELu6zrVjcbptQKwqaXVb93muaTsR8JHc4A0vubhkn2.LBqgD5O6N8ebWlO7FiXuj26LU8Nr3hzdEPTi_4AFfXHzRyAOTmSMk3GEtdCMEkjP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "edtheadmin", "published": "2018-05-23T05:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Savings Account from LedgerX!", "text": "FROM: https://blog.trello.com/how-to-scrum-and-trello-for-teams-at-work Are your team's work projects stuck in a too-much-to-do but can't-quite-finish-anything rut?

Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities, from money laundering to drug-dealing.\nIt's a debate that matters for the sprawling US national security apparatus, which has to keep track of more than 4 million people with some form of security clearance. That includes workers who, at least in theory, could sell secrets to America's enemies with the aid of anonymous transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies.\nAdvertisement Terrorists, cybercriminals Terrorists and cybercriminals use cryptocurrencies to shield their transactions from investigators and often demand payment in Bitcoins and other digital assets, according to international law-enforcement groups including the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and Europol's European Cybercrime Centre.\nLoading At the same time, young investors have decamped from the halls of prominent financial institutions for the evolving world of cryptocurrency investing, and entire states have pegged their futures to its popularity. The instrument is going mainstream as Goldman Sachs moves forward with Bitcoin trading operations.\nNevertheless, Bitcoin has fallen about 50 per cent from its December high to about $US8,200 as regulators around the world continue to evaluate how to manage digital assets and some Wall Street pros dismiss the market. Warren Buffett, for example, has likened Bitcoin to \"rat poison squared.\"\nIf the US government were to decide that owning cryptocurrencies is a security risk, it could have a \"huge negative impact\" on the growing market, according to Singh.\nAny move to more closely investigate job applicants who own cryptocurrencies also could hamper the Pentagon's efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace, a goal that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has made a priority.\n\"If we're going to say that if you've got a Bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren't going to sit around waiting to try to onboard for a government job,\" Greg Touhill, a retired Air Force general who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said in an interview. \"It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.\"\nConflicting messages The Pentagon has sent conflicting messages about how it's handling the matter.\nAfter a Defense Security Service employee suggested in an email that Bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and reported on the lengthy SF-86 security form filled out by clearance applicants, DSS quickly countered by issuing official guidance saying...there is no official Department of Defense guidance, according to ETHNews, an online cryptocurrency news site.\n\"There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies,\" according to a statement posted to the DSS website. \"DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry.\"\nThe equivocation has been cited by law firms and job search sites. ClearanceJobs.com put it bluntly: \"Should you report your Bitcoin to your security officer? It depends upon who you ask.\"\nHuge backlog The lack of clear direction from the Pentagon only adds to the headaches already faced by government contractors that need to hire workers with security clearances.\nTheir top priority is overhauling a clearance system with a backlog of more than 700,000 background investigations and billions of dollars in associated costs.\nRaytheon Co. Vice President Jane Chappell told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that fixing the clearance system should be a priority for the country and that the backlog was hurting \"programs that provide critical warfighter capabilities.\"\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well.\nParam Vir Singh For now, it appears the Pentagon needs further information from the country's financial regulators. Without a clear policy from the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to issue guidance, according to Singh.\nIn the US, bitcoin isn't treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman, but Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors virtual currency exchanges to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\nIf the US government were to assess that Bitcoin is a form of foreign currency, \"such activities could have an impact on a security clearance determination,\" Major Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nBad intent The government should keep in mind that owning cryptocurrencies may not indicate bad intent, said Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\"I don't know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk,\" Aftergood said. \"Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don't necessarily translate to risk.\"\nBut Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinise clearance applicants who own cryptocurrencies, even those who are buying and holding them as investments, known as \"HODL'ers.\"\n\"Since Bitcoin's only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,\" he said. \"As for the HODL'ers, eh, they will pass through the clearance process OK because its clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?\"\nBloomberg\nCryptocurrencies Bitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel flatley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "param vir singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnc center for financial services innovation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T05:25:04.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "552a8fa716c050d871f8f17bf57b67c067f6b838", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSgDCBs41DlbFFcSAL3gu56GLhC93kmFSWAEEMmJbnwNr0vQK5T5WF0zDcefQrfQGYR310U.FDejBgdZZza7BlcdXTRwZH7NBRdoHqbruSy.7sLqjheXyh1", "site_full": "investinginchinesestocks.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://investinginchinesestocks.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Investing in Chinese Stocks—投资大中华地区股市", "title": "Bitcoin Support at $7k, Monero Weakest, Decred Strongest", "title_full": "Bitcoin Support at $7k, Monero Weakest, Decred Strongest", "published": "2018-05-23T04:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ggKDxqwsilk/WwTHepJwGdI/AAAAAAAAPU4/_Du860acVDk41I03yk0JJcYJWsmIJszVwCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/slopechart_%2524BTC.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "552a8fa716c050d871f8f17bf57b67c067f6b838", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSgDCBs41DlbFFcSAL3gu56GLhC93kmFSWAEEMmJbnwNr0vQK5T5WF0zDcefQrfQGYR310U.FDejBgdZZza7BlcdXTRwZH7NBRdoHqbruSy.7sLqjheXyh1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (罗臻)", "published": "2018-05-23T04:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Support at $7k, Monero Weakest, Decred Strongest", "text": "2018-05-22 Bitcoin Support at $7k, Monero Weakest, Decred Strongest Monero major support at $155, could be a major break coming up here.

Would love to get some feedback from the community.\n/u/_wlc_\nDuring the last couple of months, we have been working on a project which we think will lower the barrier to entry into the world of highly secure Bitcoin storage.\nWe call our solution COINiD, and it is a regular Bitcoin wallet, but it can also work in cold wallet mode by signing transactions using a completely offline phone. In short, we separate the private key from the actual wallet and store it in a separate app that we call the COINiD Vault that handles the signing.\nA video might do it more justice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3iuELMSW1w\nAnyhow, we would love to get some help testing it and are announcing public early access today. So if you are interested in trying it out, please sign up on https://coinid.org , and you'll get an invite to our iOS TestFlight, you will then be able to install either the Testnet Wallet or the Bitcoin Wallet.\nOh yeah, currently we have the iOS version ready for testing. We will announce the Android version soon.\nIf you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them here.\nsubmitted by /u/_wlc_\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T04:29:31.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81387696a4ab69804f89b1412d314c8604f0a2e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9DOXS1i2xoi2g--", "site_full": "www.carigold.com", "site": "carigold.com", "site_section": "http://www.carigold.com/portal/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=145", "site_categories": ["investing", "non_standard_content", "finance", "adult"], "section_title": "Get-Paid-To Programmes - CariGold Forum", "title": "free bitcoins at Satoshi Hero faucet", "title_full": "free bitcoins at Satoshi Hero faucet - CariGold Forum", "published": "2018-05-23T04:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29476, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81387696a4ab69804f89b1412d314c8604f0a2e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9DOXS1i2xoi2g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alexkane", "published": "2018-05-23T04:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "free bitcoins at Satoshi Hero faucet", "text": "free bitcoins at Satoshi Hero faucet\nSatoshi Hero is a new free bitcoin faucet\nwhere you can claim several Satoshis\nhttps://satoshihero.com/en/register?r=643b13gj", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://satoshihero.com/en/register?r=643b13gj"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:45:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9aa754545ec73202193d8e38bc64d3d44096575", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOAr0ZJxJWt9vGg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "title_full": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "published": "2018-05-23T04:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9aa754545ec73202193d8e38bc64d3d44096575", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOAr0ZJxJWt9vGg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Leonardo7", "published": "2018-05-23T04:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "text": "A very great project with highly experience team, this project will end up been in a class of it own.

$8200-$8400 as Resistance now\nBitcoin (BTC/USD) has been in a bearish mode, and recent price action suggests bears are still in control.\nBTC/USD 1H Chart\n(click to enlarge)\nFalse Breakout: The 1H chart shows a bearish market that had a bullish moment when price came up from an inverted head and shoulders. But, after climbing to $8600, which was like the middle of the previous consolidation structure, BTC/USD fell. This respect of previous consolidation as a resistance suggested bears were in charge. As price slides back below $8000, we should start looking at the $8400 level as key resistance. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise if a subsequent rebound finds resistance at $8200. We are looking at a slide towards the $7500 area.

But unlike any Top-Tier event, you were invited … if you could afford it. At approximately $2,000, Consensus 2018 was the most expensive edition in the Bitcoin conference’s history. Despite that, it was the most heavily attended by a country mile. Founded by CoinDesk, Consensus 2018 drew 8,500 attendees, an all-time record. Last year’s haul topped out at 2,700 people, which was a respectable figure at that time, representing a near-doubling from Consensus 2016. But at a growth rate of 215%, this year’s edition took the Bitcoin conference to a whole new level. Usually, cryptocurrency-related events are self-serving. Nothing new is learned because the people attending do not have to be sold on anything. Most are already steeped in the Bitcoin culture. What made Consensus 2018 stand out was its diversity. Not everyone was a believer, and even among the faithful, not everyone saw eye to eye. Most importantly, Consensus 2018 proved that the Bitcoin ecosystem was far more than just speculators looking to profit. Here is a deeper look at the Bitcoin conference and the issues presented, and some of the Key reasons Bitcoin and blockchain are here to stay, as follows: Reason #1: Bulls Go to Bat for Bitcoin With the way the mainstream media has portrayed Bitcoin and the blockchain as a wildly speculative venture, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) chairman and chief executive Fred Smith’s words may come as a surprise. Smith matter-of-factly states, “Blockchain has the potential to completely revolutionize what’s across the border.” He further doubled-down on the blockchain technology and its implications. In front of a packed audience, he stated, “For cross-border shipments, ‘trust’ is legal requirement for every transaction. What blockchain has is a potential for the first time ever to make the information available for everybody.” In terms of the logistics business, Smith’s support for blockchain is completely understandable. One of the biggest challenges with international shipments is dealing with differences: different regulations, operating protocols, industry-specific terminologies and cultural expectations. Anything that can standardize the logistics platform would go a long way in making the overall process more efficient. Thus, the FedEx CEO praised the blockchain technology’s “chain of custody.” Put another way, the blockchain allows everyone to speak one language. Perhaps the most significant aspect of FedEx’s love affair with the blockchain is that it’s not just lip service. The company joined the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA) in an effort to explore how blockchain applications can positively impact the logistics industry. I’m biased, of course, but FedEx is making the right, and necessary, decision. The company’s CIO, Fred Carter, stated: “We move easily 12 million shipments a day and that more than doubles during the peak seasons. While we absolutely believe this technology is going to scale, right now it makes sense for us to do this in our freight world.” Reason #2: Blockchain Has Practical Utility Carter hits upon a critical point. While the general public’s idea about cryptocurrencies centers on speculative financial investments, and 20-year old kids driving Lambos, what gets lost in the discussion is that the blockchain has practical utility. Yes, everyone talks about the soaring Bitcoin price, and it’s true that overnight millionaires have sprouted across the world. In its initial launch, the original cryptocurrency could have been purchased for under a buck. But at the end of the day, cryptocurrencies are blockchain reward tokens. Bitcoin’s highly speculative market value is a separate issue from the underlying blockchain technology. That’s why I’m glad Consensus 2018 featured FedEx. Their executives understand what so many fail to see. Regarding Carter’s point, his organization is already operating at the highest level. Yet shipping demand will only increase. The advent of e-Commerce, and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominance, in particular, will continue to shift consumer behavior. As I mentioned in my recent write-up for Amazon, the company’s Prime membership comprises consumers of all income levels. Furthermore, the difference between Amazon’s affluent and lower-income consumers isn’t nearly as lopsided as you might imagine. I wrote: As expected, the affluent find enormous value in Prime. Approximately 70% of people who earn $150,000 or more, and who shop online, are Prime members. Moreover, over half of online customers who make between $50,000 and $125,000 are also active Prime users. This broad income bracket essentially represents most upscale retailers’ target demographic. Put another way, the vast majority of consumers love shopping at Amazon, and love shopping online in general. Both FedEx and its rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) should experience a demand boon in upcoming years. And that means both companies need a next-generation innovation to keep up. Reason #3: Blockchain Will Cause Trickle-Down Effect Granted, Amazon is currently experimenting with their own courier system, and that could impinge on FedEx and UPS revenues. While it’s not the greatest thing to happen for couriers, I wouldn’t get too worried. Here’s what I wrote at the time: “However, I think the bearishness is overplayed. While Amazon could theoretically replace UPS and similar services, it would be a massive undertaking. The longer-term benefit for AMZN in terms of reducing shipping costs could be outweighed due to the onerous investment. From an economies of scale perspective, it may make sense for Amazon to continue utilizing UPS.” But the greater point is that no one entity can possibly handle the demand surge. My InvestorPlace colleague Will Ashworth, with regards to Amazon’s proposed internal courier service, stated, “I just don’t think that’s feasible or sensible given Amazon’s real business is selling 100 million Prime members as many things as possible.” Exactly. This isn’t a knock on Amazon, of which I’ve been especially bullish. But as great as they are, they couldn’t possibly cover all the gaps. Next, you have to consider the competition. Big-box retailers Walmart Inc(NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) have aggressively pushed into the e-Commerce market. Their efforts will continue with the same, if not increased, aggression. I admit that Walmart has not demonstrated ideal results late last year, which is why WMT stock has skidded. However, operational issues impeded their progress. Translation: Walmart perhaps bit off more than it can chew. But the challenges of e-Commerce make one thing clear. Consumers increasingly prefer online retail, and current solutions aren’t working effectively. This is a perfect opportunity for the blockchain to flex its muscles. Eventually, other companies will have to embrace it, or slowly fade away. Reason # 4: Blockchain Forces Companies to Adapt … or Die FedEx CEO Fred Smith had one final comment at Consensus 2018. He stated: “If you are not operating at the edge of new technologies, you will surely be disrupted. If you are not willing to embrace new technologies like internet of things and blockchain to face those new threats, you are, maybe subtly, at some point … going to extinction.” I find myself marveling at FedEx’s leadership team. Unlike so many other executives and mainstream pundits, Smith discerns the strawman arguments used against Bitcoin. As I stated earlier, Bitcoin’s speculative trading and its underlying blockchain technology are completely separate issues. That the Bitcoin price is as wild as a penny stock has nothing to do with the blockchain’s utilitarian value. What many critics miss is that you don’t have to ever invest in cryptocurrencies to benefit from the blockchain. The price of Bitcoin could fall to zero, which I highly doubt. Yet even in that draconian circumstance, I believe that Pandora’s Box has already been opened. Once people see what’s possible, there’s no going back. Furthermore, most companies will eventually be forced to adapt to the blockchain, or die. As enterprising businesses advantage the new technology’s utility, they’ll get a head start in their industry. By adopting an irrationally negative attitude toward the blockchain, competitors risk obsolescence. To be clear, I’m not suggesting that the blockchain is a cure-all for any company. If a business is a failing one, a new technology would only decelerate its inevitable demise. But for an organization not to try based on precontrived feelings would be the height of folly. Reason #5: Even Bitcoin Critics Will Turn Around Currently, cryptocurrency critics will note that the Bitcoin price has fallen sharply since Consensus 2018 started. If the biggest crypto proponents can’t pump up the digital markets, who can? Fair enough. However, I wouldn’t be too comfortable taking potshots at bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be more resilient than people give them credit for. In addition, things will eventually turn around in the right direction. How can I be so sure? Because even the haters realize that their derision toward cryptocurrencies lacks common and business sense. Compare it to tulip bubbles all you want. All the criticisms in the world have been widely disseminated through the internet. Not a single, unique argument against Bitcoin exists because we have heard every one. Yet in this hate-filled environment, the haters are backing away from their reproach. I’m speaking of course about Facebook , Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Earlier this year, the social media giant announced a draconian ban on all cryptocurrency-related advertisements. It was one of the biggest knee-jerk reactions in recent memory. With Facebook , I understood their concerns. Several cryptocurrency-related projects are indeed scams. But I could say the same thing about other projects and businesses, including publicly traded companies. Rather than blame individual con-artists, Facebook took the easy way out and accused the platform. That was a big mistake, and they know it. Now, they’re exploring how the blockchain technology can aid their business. Facebook could have saved themselves much embarrassment and at least stayed Neutral. Reason #6: More Companies to Get Bitcoin Fever If Consensus 2018 has taught us anything, it’s that Bitcoin is no longer for nerds. FedEx executives just went to bat for the blockchain. This is no longer a niche market you can simply ignore. I’m even more bullish on Bitcoin, if such a thing is possible. That’s because the immense popularity over Consensus 2018 is just the beginning. More companies will follow FedEx’s lead. But just as importantly, more companies will follow Facebook’s lead. Initially, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR) adopted Facebook’s early stance on cryptocurrencies. The former 2 companies banned crypto-related advertisements I suppose as a show of solidarity. They too will regret their hasty and illogical decisions. I genuinely don’t care what any Alphabet executive personally thinks about Bitcoin; by refusing crypto-related advertisements, they’re throwing free money away. Last year, “Bitcoin” was one of the top Googled search items. I can virtually guarantee you that it will remain highly popular for years to come. Thus, it makes zero sense to ban advertisements for a subject everyone is talking about. A few months back, I happened to watch Jim Cramer briefly discussed cryptocurrencies. I normally don’t get my financial advice from Jim Cramer, and this time was no different. But what intrigued me was that his friends called him up to ask about bitcoin. I don’t know Jim Cramer, but he doesn’t strike me as a bitcoin guy. So if Cramer’s friends who are probably stodgy, stocks and bonds type of folks, are bugging him about Bitcoin, imagine the conversations occurring on Main Street. And if anyone wants to learn about Bitcoin, Google is the first site they’ll go. That means the company will idly watch easily convertible metrics slip by. It’s insane, and they’ll soon recant. Not Everything Was Rosy for Consensus 2018 By almost any reasonable standard, Consensus 2018 was a huge success. Bitcoin received unprecedented attention and credibility. Like I said earlier, this sector is no longer just for computer nerds. It’s hit the big-time in the Big Apple . But not everything about Consensus 2018 was a standout success. In some ways, this bitcoin conference was defined not by who was there, but who wasn’t. And Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin’s absence was especially conspicuous. To get a ticket to the event at the last minute will cost you $3,000. That’s roughly 33% the cost of a single Bitcoin. Buterin took exception to this highway robbery, stating simply, “I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent-seeking.” I can understand why he was upset. As one of the blockchain space’s most prominent and accomplished figures, I appreciated his standing up for the little guys. Consensus 2018 offered valuable content and insights; that, no one will argue against. But the hoopla and extracurricular activities were something the conference could do without. For instance, the parading of the Lamborghinis was tacky. It screams desperation and insecurity. In my opinion, it was a bad look for the cryptocurrency sector’s marquee event. More critically, Buterin may have been concerned that the blockchain was losing its ideological base. What should be celebrated was not crass commercialism, but rather, the blockchain’s ability to open doors. As it has done for the logistics business, cryptocurrencies offer trading based on a Neutral platform. In other words, people can finally invest outside the USD hegemony. This puts emerging-market investors on the same floor as American or western investors. Yet the Lambo parade suggested that bitcoin proponents could care less about the blockchain’s social impact. Consensus 2018 Lacked Consensus Indeed, one of the ironic characteristics about Consensus 2018 was that it lacked exactly that: consensus. Don’t get me wrong, most people at the conference support Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. But this did not involve folks preaching to the choir. Going back to Buterin, he complained that Consensus 2018 founder CoinDesk lacked integrity. The Ethereum founder claimed that CoinDesk resorts to “gotcha” tactics for its off-the-record policy. Obviously, I cannot corroborate Buterin’s accusation. However, his statements indicate that the blockchain space has substantial room for further maturing. For instance, a reporter had to wait over an hour to get her entrance badge. Nor was this an isolated case. Several attendees, irrespective of status, also waited an hour to gain admission. In fact, Consensus 2018 had to start the day with an apology for operational inefficiencies. Fireworks also erupted on the panel floor. Prominent blockchain business owners engaged in heated debates over the crypto sector’s direction. One side felt that the sector was hitting a bubble, that too many blockchain projects were speculative. The other side disagreed sharply, ultimately ending the feud with a bitcoin bet. The details of this debate don’t really interest me. Rather, I find it intriguing that wildly successful bitcoin adopters still sharply disagree about bitcoin. I also find this dynamic encouraging. You’ll often hear critics state that cryptocurrencies are the modern-day tulip bubbles. But if that were the case, why the robust debates within the sector? I’d understand if the counterarguments originated from outside the bitcoin love-fest. But they’re not. Some of the biggest bitcoin supporters are also its biggest critics. Last time I checked, bubbles occur because most everyone believes the only direction is up. At Consensus 2018, no such consensus existed. The Bankers Have Their Say For me, the biggest surprise of the Bitcoin conference was St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard. He attended Consensus 2018, and it went down how you might imagine it. Bullard stated to the audience: You’ve got this kind of special problem of who’s going to issue the currency and what are those promises about future issuance and can you really maintain the credibility of those promises. If you can’t, the value of your currency is going to zero the same way the Venezuelan bolivar has. Mr. Bullard further noted that non-uniform currencies have historically met significant resistance, and later failed. In his view, cryptocurrencies have a challenged road ahead before they can achieve mainstream financial acceptance. “They’ve got to compete just like everybody else…welcome to the currency competition game,” Mr. Bullard said. Respectfully, but unfortunately, the Fed banker misses the point. Cryptocurrencies represent a paradigm shift in how we view money. To merely categorize them as “non-uniform currencies” is a grave disservice, if not disinformation. The value of the dollar doesn’t just stem from US economic stability; rather, our military backs our currency. Recall that when Admiral Perry opened Japan’s borders, he did so with battleships. Currencies, particularly western currencies, have always been inked with blood. Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn’t threaten anyone. It merely encourages through unprecedented opportunities. The value of Bitcoin in Nigeria is the same as the value of Bitcoin in Norway. All participants operate on the same platform with the same rules. The blockchain doesn’t consider any other factor, such as skin color or national allegiances. Put another way, people want to use Bitcoin. In sharp contrast, people are forced to use the USD. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin and Consensus 2018 Consensus 2018 had its fair share of problems. The organizers clearly didn’t prepare adequately for the popularity surge, and frankly, they have no excuse. Ticket-buyers didn’t just pop up randomly; ample time was in place for proper administration and procedures. I also wasn’t impressed with Consensus 2018 not taking care of its media guests. Again, you can’t excuse organizers not having made prior arrangements for financial/business journalists. These are the folks to fast-track as they will relay their opinions to everyone else. After all, Consensus 2018 is typically the only time in the year that outsiders can glimpse inside the crypto world. For this audience, you want to present the best image possible. Instead, it looked like amateur hour. That said, the annual Bitcoin conference achieved what all cryptocurrency proponents have sought: mainstream acceptance and credibility. Bitcoin started off as a get-rich-quick scheme. Now, its underlying technology made the most powerful names in business take notice. Not only that, but the diversity of opinions suggests that we’re still a long way from the dreaded Bitcoin bubble. As I stated earlier, Consensus 2018 was marked for the lack of consensus. Moreover, the conference organizers’ clumsy operations has a silver lining. If the conference itself was surprised at the attendee number, imagine what the next year will bring. The Bitcoin price is almost 60% lower than its all-time high now.\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at: 8,002.8848, -324.49, or -3.90% , a s of 1:12a BST, the market is open In any other asset, such losses would cause severe panic. But not the cryptocurrency sector. This market has seen the worst of times, yet its proponents keep coming back for more.\nNote: Josh Enomoto is long Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nBy Josh Enomoto", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETHUSD=X?p=ETHUSD=X", "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTCUSD=X?p=BTCUSD=X", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://www.g-bit.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "new yor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T08:21:03.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a38eef138c063a679faf77664551bc36ea339ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRl_T9af0gByxfqJ_9SY2AsxxT59AoHvDpoqKRyctYEA6XkrMZytl8RIdhNE8agW6x3kUIRlmhhyfMbDCxpupdgtTE3bpViheSMmkhoktayT3UjWvp14ATvxlod1hY1pPYXaUY7PHxDAQ--", "site_full": "btcbrainpro.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://btcbrainpro.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it. – BTC Brain", "title": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.", "title_full": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.", "published": "2018-05-23T03:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a38eef138c063a679faf77664551bc36ea339ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRl_T9af0gByxfqJ_9SY2AsxxT59AoHvDpoqKRyctYEA6XkrMZytl8RIdhNE8agW6x3kUIRlmhhyfMbDCxpupdgtTE3bpViheSMmkhoktayT3UjWvp14ATvxlod1hY1pPYXaUY7PHxDAQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcbrainpro", "published": "2018-05-23T03:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.", "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBRWJzAjkjk via /r/Bitcoin https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lcldm/we_asked_an_ai_bot_to_explain_bitcoin_to_us_and/?utm_source=ifttt ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T03:17:30.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "461f7a9f7e9feb1f8ad98d4659acb9523bbecb17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLSJ3TKvpnSE9NcWlVl6e3w-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T03:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "461f7a9f7e9feb1f8ad98d4659acb9523bbecb17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLSJ3TKvpnSE9NcWlVl6e3w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T03:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 23, 2018 NEWS The Bitcoin Pizza is Worth $83 Million Today CryptoSlate Today is one of the most celebrated days in the crypto community.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a 'security risk' in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards\nIf You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem American bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered \"risky\" in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n\"There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,\" explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well.\nDSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings Further, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency's Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n\"DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,\" explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell's email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance.\nUniversity of California Researcher: 'Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion' Individuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don't necessarily make a person risky. \"I don't know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don't necessarily translate to risk,\" Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. \"Since Bitcoin's only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,\" Weaver said this week. It's also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a 'security risk' have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company's employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon's discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?
