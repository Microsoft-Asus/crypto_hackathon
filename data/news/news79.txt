As the New York Times points out, the decision “is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump’s feed and its 52 million followers.” A blog post on the online version of the monthly magazine Reason provides some tips for politicians with social media accounts who want to stay on the right side of the law.\nSpeaking of President Trump, the former secretary of a federal judge is claiming the President got her fired. Okay, not exactly. The secretary, Olga Zuniga, who worked for a judge on Texas’s highest criminal court, filed a lawsuit alleging that the judge—a member of the GOP—terminated her employment because he found Facebook posts in which Zuniga criticized President Trump’s and other Republican politicians’ immigration policies. A post on Popehat , a fellow ABA Web 100 honoree, explores the strength of Zuniga’s case .\nUnless you’ve been living in a cave, you know that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect last Friday, May 25 th .

Instead, we had to wait for fees [in BTC] to cripple any consumer usage before we woke up.”\nSince 2014, OpenBazaar has been accepting Bitcoin payments, which have made up the majority of its transactions. Yet due to high transaction fees and wait times, the e-commerce website that was one of the first to accept cryptocurrency is looking to support a wider range of cryptocurrencies optimized for e-commerce.\nWhereas OpenBazaar plans to emphasize alternative cryptocurrency payments, the leading e-commerce blockchain protocol, CyberMiles , has announced the launch of an online marketplace that is among the first platforms to support only cryptocurrency.\nThe marketplace, known as Blocktonic.io , exclusively accepts the CyberMiles ERC-20 token, CMT , as a payment method. Consumers can purchase more than 60 different products on Blocktonic.io, including electronics and the CMT Cube , which is CyberMiles’ new crypto mining machine.\n“We’re excited to bring a true blockchain (crypto-only) e-commerce site,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder of the CyberMiles Foundation, said. “Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize e-commerce, and we’re confident Blocktonic is a step towards that, enriching the CyberMiles ecosystem with real application.” No Transaction Fees\nWhile there are several unique aspects of the Blocktonic marketplace, the most notable is the exclusive acceptance of CyberMiles’ token.\nAccording to statistics from transactionfee.info , Bitcoin’s median fee fell to a low on April 4 and 5 of 6.86 satoshi/bytes (sat/B). As of May 29, the transaction fee is 9.71 sat/B.\nAlternatively, the CyberMiles blockchain waives transaction fees for consumers using CMT on the Blocktonic marketplace.\n“Little to no transaction fees is necessary to encourage consumers, even and especially in the crypto community, to shop [on] blockchain-based marketplaces like Blocktonic,” Michael Yuan, CyberMiles’ Chief Scientist, told me. “This was a strategic decision on our part, having no upfront transaction fee and only a nominal (1%) gas fee on the back end for ETH withdrawals from customer accounts. The proof is in the popularity —nearly 10,000 product orders within a few hours of the site’s launch alone.”\nAdditionally, products that consumers purchase on Blocktonic.io are essentially free, as payments will be refunded over an extended period of time under a spending cashback program. Through the program, Blocktonic will offer a 100% rebate within a year to buyers who use CMT to purchase the CMT Cube. And Blocktonic shoppers can earn referral bonuses when they invite their friends to shop on the marketplace, which currently supports languages such as English, Korean and Vietnamese. Why BTC Transactions Aren’t Optimal For E-Commerce\nWhile Bitcoin might be considered a good investment for some cryptocurrency holders, it was never a great means of payment. High transaction fees and the volatility associated with Bitcoin prevent it from being a practical form of payment.\nAnd while it’s convenient for merchants to sign on to accept cryptocurrency via specialized payment platforms, the rate of volatility and high transaction fees make it impractical for e-commerce merchants to implement. In July, Morgan Stanley issued a report saying merchants’ acceptance of Bitcoin was on a downward trend just as the cryptocurrency’s exchange rate went through the roof.\nDue to the issues affecting Bitcoin payments, the few decentralized e-commerce marketplaces in the crypto space like OpenBazaar and Blocktonic will need to find alternative payment methods.

Now, he has written at length about the risks and rewards of Bitcoin BCH, relative to Bitcoin Core (BTC)—an exercise he believes demonstrates BCH is the better prospect.\nThe developer laid out his case in a Medium post , concluding that the limits to BTC’s scaling potential, and the growing acceptance of BCH as the true version of Bitcoin, mean BTC has now become the riskier investment.\nFyookball, creator of the Electron Cash wallet , was among the attendees at the recently held CoinGeek Conference in Hong Kong, where he said it became clearer to him that the tables have now turned, “Now it is BTC that carries a huge risk of not being able to scale.”\nHe wrote:\n“When Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu was asked on stage ‘Why are the miners still supporting Bitcoin Core? Is it just a short term profitability play?’, he answered: ‘Yes, exactly.’ The answer rang true. Think about it: the miners are now economically incentivized to keep BTC from scaling, since they are profiting from high fees.\n“You might ask ‘why does the short term incentive apply to BTC and the long term incentive apply to BCH?’ The answer is because those are the incentive models already chosen by the nature of each of the protocols.”\nFyookball continued, highlighting BCH as the only Bitcoin capable of addressing the challenges of scale.\n“BCH meets the need of the long term business model — it can become global peer to peer cash, it wants to be that, and it already has 32MB blocks. There’s no reason at all to have 2 coins do that. By contrast, BTC’s high fees already make the miners short term profits, so there’s no reason to change that either.”\nHis views chime with a growing consensus amongst those in the wider cryptocurrency space, as an increasing number of merchants and investors turn to Bitcoin BCH as the only effective model for peer-to-peer transactions.\nWithout the high transaction costs and lengthy delays caused by the inadequacies in the BTC blockchain, BCH is already primed for use at scale, even more so with its 32MB block size .\nWhile Fyookball has been bullish on BCH for some time, he now feels the writing is on the wall for the legacy BTC coin, noting, “…the most likely scenario for the next 1–2 years is that BCH continues to gain adoption, and BTC continues to spin its wheels.” Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

Instead, we had to wait for fees [in BTC] to cripple any consumer usage before we woke up.”\nSince 2014, OpenBazaar has been accepting Bitcoin payments, which have made up the majority of its transactions. Yet due to high transaction fees and wait times, the e-commerce website that was one of the first to accept cryptocurrency is looking to support a wider range of cryptocurrencies optimized for e-commerce.\nWhereas OpenBazaar plans to emphasize alternative cryptocurrency payments, the leading e-commerce blockchain protocol, CyberMiles , has announced the launch of an online marketplace that is among the first platforms to support only cryptocurrency.\nThe marketplace, known as Blocktonic.io , exclusively accepts the CyberMiles ERC-20 token, CMT , as a payment method. Consumers can purchase more than 60 different products on Blocktonic.io, including electronics and the CMT Cube , which is CyberMiles’ new crypto mining machine.\n“We’re excited to bring a true blockchain (crypto-only) e-commerce site,” Dr. Lucas Lu, founder of the CyberMiles Foundation, said. “Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize e-commerce, and we’re confident Blocktonic is a step towards that, enriching the CyberMiles ecosystem with real application.” No Transaction Fees\nWhile there are several unique aspects of the Blocktonic marketplace, the most notable is the exclusive acceptance of CyberMiles’ token.\nAccording to statistics from transactionfee.info , Bitcoin’s median fee fell to a low on April 4 and 5 of 6.86 satoshi/bytes (sat/B). As of May 29, the transaction fee is 9.71 sat/B.\nAlternatively, the CyberMiles blockchain waives transaction fees for consumers using CMT on the Blocktonic marketplace.\n“Little to no transaction fees is necessary to encourage consumers, even and especially in the crypto community, to shop [on] blockchain-based marketplaces like Blocktonic,” Michael Yuan, CyberMiles’ Chief Scientist, told me. “This was a strategic decision on our part, having no upfront transaction fee and only a nominal (1%) gas fee on the back end for ETH withdrawals from customer accounts. The proof is in the popularity —nearly 10,000 product orders within a few hours of the site’s launch alone.”\nAdditionally, products that consumers purchase on Blocktonic.io are essentially free, as payments will be refunded over an extended period of time under a spending cashback program. Through the program, Blocktonic will offer a 100% rebate within a year to buyers who use CMT to purchase the CMT Cube. And Blocktonic shoppers can earn referral bonuses when they invite their friends to shop on the marketplace, which currently supports languages such as English, Korean and Vietnamese. Why BTC Transactions Aren’t Optimal For E-Commerce\nWhile Bitcoin might be considered a good investment for some cryptocurrency holders, it was never a great means of payment. High transaction fees and the volatility associated with Bitcoin prevent it from being a practical form of payment.\nAnd while it’s convenient for merchants to sign on to accept cryptocurrency via specialized payment platforms, the rate of volatility and high transaction fees make it impractical for e-commerce merchants to implement. In July, Morgan Stanley issued a report saying merchants’ acceptance of Bitcoin was on a downward trend just as the cryptocurrency’s exchange rate went through the roof.\nDue to the issues affecting Bitcoin payments, the few decentralized e-commerce marketplaces in the crypto space like OpenBazaar and Blocktonic will need to find alternative payment methods. OpenBazaar has mentioned plans for a site redesign to accommodate multiple cryptocurrencies , while Blocktonic will use the CMT token to avoid transaction fees and long wait times for purchases.

And so the presumption is that we will use bitcoin like we use cash, only online. But BitPay and their partners are showing how Bitcoin’s next big use case might not be preordering your coffee, but enabling businesses to open up to global markets.\nFor companies looking to go global, Bitcoin can be a godsend. The hoops that have to be jumped through, the regulations, the banks, currency conversion, are greatly lessened through the use of Bitcoin.\nImagine a Chinese online shopper attempting to buy a digital item from someone in the United States. As the majority of Chinese shoppers don’t have credit cards and instead use debit cards that are linked to Chinese banks, this isn’t as easy as it may seem. A digital item should be a painless process to purchase online in any jurisdiction but ancient fiat banking system makes it anything but. First, the customer’s yuan would have to be transferred to dollars at a Chinese bank. Then the money would have to enter the SWIFT network through another bank. A few days or weeks later it would “arrive” at the corresponding SWIFT bank in the United States who would then, finally, transfer it to the seller’s bank.\nAnd inside that process, there are at least two fees. A fee for converting yuan to US dollars and another for using the SWIFT network. Depending on the individual banks, more fees could be included, like an international purchase fee. All the while the merchant will have two choices: send the item right away and hope that the money actually arrives, or wait until the money arrives and risk losing the customer to a domestic seller who can deliver quicker. Granted, services like Paypal and its subsidiary Xoom simplify this process greatly, but not everyone uses it, not every Chinese bank works with Xoom and there can be delays that last days.\nWith Bitcoin, the customer simply sends Bitcoin, the Merchant gets it almost instantly (or up to an hour if the merchant wants to wait for blockchain confirmations) and then sends the item to the buyer. No mess, low fees.\nOn the face of it, that might not seem like a big deal. There probably aren’t that many people from the US selling digital products to Chinese customers, especially since there are massive differences in the popular social and gaming platforms between those two countries. But the above example was used for simplicity sake. There are lots of real companies that want to sell actual products in China but are prevented from doing so because of financial red tape.\nIn a recent blog post, Bitpay who processed $1.2B in payments last year laid out an example of how they are helping facilitate global trade through B2B transactions that would have been more difficult in traditional finance.\n“Bellatorra CEO Nathan Halsey previously ran a skin-care company which operated for four years in China. They found roadblocks to growth – namely, they were only able to receive cash transactions from their clients due to cross-border currency exchange limitations. […] When a Chinese cosmetics distributor recently approached Halsey and his current company Bellatorra about using bitcoin to pay for a wholesale shipment, the game changed. Bellatorra and the Chinese wholesaler turned to [BitPay] to process the six-figure payment. […] Now Bellatorra is moving to use bitcoin in more transactions, with values processed via BitPay expected to grow by 10X in the near term.”\nWe spoke with Sonny Singh, CCO of Bitpay at Consensus 2018 to discuss B2B payments and he explained the financial benefits for businesses.\n“We are allowing global customers to have their suppliers pay them in bitcoin because it’s cheaper and quicker than a bank wire. We can move from most places in the world in one business day for a 1% fee while international wires normally take around 3 days and cost 3%.”\nAnd this is often the aspect of the crypto revolution that is often forgotten. As useful as crypto is for individuals and as exciting as the large financial institution’s potential involvements are, it is perhaps the medium-sized and small businesses that have the most to gain from cryptocurrencies. Multinational corporations have the connections and bankroll to make selling items overseas relatively easy and profitable. Individuals using Bitcoin for remittance is exciting if it is done en masse but getting users to switch has proven to be a long and gradual process.\nMedium and small businesses have a lot to gain by using bitcoin in B2B transactions. Sure, using bitcoin as a payment option for regular customers has potential rewards, but like remittance, those rewards won’t be reaped until bitcoin hits the mainstream.\nFirst, the fees make a lot more sense. With small transactions, bitcoin doesn’t always have that large of an advantage over traditional finance in terms of fees. With Lightning, that may change, but regardless it is hard to convince consumers to change monetary systems to save a few bucks on one item. The only way it works is if you convince thousands of customers to do it, and that has proven difficult. It is much easier to get one company to change their system for a few percentage points that can add up over time. Especially with resellers, where margins are small and the market is ultra competitive.\nWith the Bellatorra example, and the news that gold dealer Sharps Pixley is using BitPay to enable both gold to bitcoin and bitcoin to gold transactions, BitPay is showing how the bitcoin use case question might not be solved with the big financial giants or individual consumers, but the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in the middle.

The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners.\nIf you don’t possess your private key, you don’t own bitcoins.\nPrivate Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them\nA private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments.

The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method.\nMnemonic Phrase\nIf someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings.\nAn example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key.\nA Backup Keyfile or JSON File\nThere are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys.\nThe Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping\nImport\nThere are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys.\nSweep\nEssentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden.\nBitcoin: Be Your Own Bank\nAs we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency’s keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership.

The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank .\nAre you sure you own your private keys?

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2080 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data feed via Bittrex). The pair is currently correcting lower towards the $0.2150 and $0.2080 support levels.\nCardano price is moving nicely in a bullish zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ADA/USD is likely to resume its uptrend once the current correction is over.\nCardano Price Analysis\nThere were solid gains in ADA price from the $0.1900 swing low against the US Dollar. The price surged higher and broke many resistance levels such as $0.2000 and $0.2080. More importantly, there was a break above a crucial resistance at $0.2150. It traded as high as $0.2280 before sellers appeared. It is currently correcting lower and moved below the $0.2250 level.\nThere was a break below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.1966 low to $0.2280 high. However, there are many supports on the downside on the way up to $0.2000. An initial support is at $0.2150, which was a resistance earlier and now a major support. Below $0.2150, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.1966 low to $0.2280 high is near $0.2120. Moreover, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2080 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair.\nThe chart indicates that the price may correct a few points in the near term towards $0.2150 and $0.2080. Later, once the correction is over, it is likely to resume its upside move. On the upside, a break above $0.2280 may perhaps clear the path for more gains towards the $0.2500 level.\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is currently placed in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ADA/USD is showing positive signs and is currently near the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $0.2080 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "helena bitcoin mining cardano price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardano price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T20:48:29.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba92d0e1860ed3cc941b42ecfec789db12fda28d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RTx8pNdCT9V0xHze3Godr1eTRAiWWS1xx2SD94gnXLLmVV3LZJPChcBWUXeD0ZjJAHj1J6MgVoyqLlZU.o1oi88I2dgUFJafl2RhYHiDB4GsNc_hc_hnoEn3v3ysO852AMq11gmpypnaOs8dl2Bh4d", "site_full": "atbitcoin.com", "site": "atbitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Indian Police Investigate Bitconnect Firm Offering 365% Yearly Returns on Bitcoin Investment - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Indian Police Investigate Bitconnect Firm Offering 365% Yearly Returns on Bitcoin Investment - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba92d0e1860ed3cc941b42ecfec789db12fda28d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RTx8pNdCT9V0xHze3Godr1eTRAiWWS1xx2SD94gnXLLmVV3LZJPChcBWUXeD0ZjJAHj1J6MgVoyqLlZU.o1oi88I2dgUFJafl2RhYHiDB4GsNc_hc_hnoEn3v3ysO852AMq11gmpypnaOs8dl2Bh4d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Indian Police Investigate Bitconnect Firm Offering 365% Yearly Returns on Bitcoin Investment - Bitcoin News", "text": "Indian Police Investigate Bitconnect Firm Offering 365% Yearly Returns on Bitcoin Investment by admin · June 1, 2018 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T21:27:02.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b8f8bf5e6dc93a970a1a82828a1eb1f272d2956", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.eb0iM6BuzbbkvGH8ORwow-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b8f8bf5e6dc93a970a1a82828a1eb1f272d2956", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.eb0iM6BuzbbkvGH8ORwow-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nThe number of referral network levels will be reduced for all newly registered users shortly!

According to its last-known position in March 2018, Bitcoin stands at 24 million (its blockchain explorer no longer provides this data).\nWhere these figures may impose, Ethereum’s growth stands in the shadow of its former self — the network welcoming more than 300,000 new addresses on several days during ETH’s January all-time high. Source: https://etherscan.io/chart/address\nTapering off alongside the opening of Q1’s bear market, the fervor for address creation can be seen to decline at the close of January. The overall growth trend, however, has not declined. Unique Addresses: Telling the Whole Story?\nEthereum’s overtake may deal a sentimental blow to Bitcoin, yet it must be noted that these figures only represent the on-chain transactions. Users of a centralized exchange — Binance or Coinbase, for example — may avoid using addresses entirely and are not represented in this data.\nFurthermore, 35 million unique addresses may not equate to 35 million active users — users of Ethereum may create and use multiple addresses for transacting or executing smart contracts.\nInstead, active unique addresses and transactions per day may paint a more accurate picture of a blockchain’s true total number of users — denoting the number of wallets actually sending or receiving assets in any given day.\nYet using these yardsticks, Ethereum still takes the lead with 513,000 addresses to Bitcoin’s 443,000 actively in use (May 30, 2018) — and 832,000 transactions to 209,000 (May 31, 2018). The Flippening?\nThese metrics may be fuel for proponents of ‘the Flippening ’ — a cult-like internet community who believe Ethereum will dethrone Bitcoin as premier cryptocurrency by market capitalization. “The Flippening” is a meme in crypto culture for Ethereum overtaking BItcoin in market cap.\nWhile mostly propagated by staunch backers of Ethereum, “the Flippening” may be losing its somewhat cult-like status and coming closer to becoming hegemonic thought. Roger Ver, for one, appears to believe such an event may be on the horizon.\nEarlier this month, prominent early BTC investor and known Bitcoin Cash advocate told The Independent :\n“Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.”\nWhere speculation may fall on deaf ears, numbers speak volumes. While Ethereum’s market cap may constitute only 44.7% of Bitcoin’s $157 billion, it would appear to be outpacing the original blockchain in technological ambition.

Everyone was waiting for NEO to rocket, and it finally did! I hope you all made a very nice profit, and if you are still in it I hope you will gain even more. I only had 30 NEO, bought at 7 (before it dropped to 3) and sold it at 32. Could have gotten more, but I walked away with a $700+ profit. No regrets. Over the past week I have been trying to finish this update, but the market is moving and changing so quickly and I am learning so much, that I went back to rewrite sections multiple times up to a point where it just became an incoherent wall of text.So I am going to keep it relatively brief and to the point.You probably have seen the thread going around the internet called: How I fucked up and turned ~600 BTC into 200 BTCIt's a crazy story, but I recognize some of his mistakes, because I made the same, and the text below I wrote prior to reading that thread. While coincidental, I think it's pretty common for a beginner.I came into Crypo, fully intended to buy Bitcoin and HODL, but very quickly got distracted by altcoins and ended up with a bag of alt/shitcoins which I bought very close to the previous highest highs, and all ended up in the red. At a later point, when I wanted to test some new ideas I added a few hundred more to put in test coins, which also ended up in the red. I didn't even get to test; they went straight into the red even though the charts were looking favorable.Leading up to the fork and having studied my losses, I started to realize that HODLing losing trades probably wasn't a good idea despite what 90% of the crypto community thinks, but considering I was the noob in the room who hadn't been through a full cycle yet, I gave the community the benefit of the doubt and kept my altcoins. The same community was convinced that Bitcoin Cash was going to crash, despite me being open to the Bitcoin Cash solution. I think Bitcoin Cash is on the right side from a philosophical perspective, and Bitcoin Core from a practical perspective even though I really don't like what they are doing.Prior to the fork, based on aforementioned and because I had no idea how the fork would affect the individual altcoins and my portfolio as a whole, I decided to HODL my altcoins, do not pass 'Go' and do not collect Bitcoin Cash. My portfolio wasn't in a great state and I did not want to make it worse by making a wrong move, again.The fork was a very enlightening experience for various reasons but you were there, so I will skip that part. One of the things I was most curious about during the fork, is how altcoins would behave. Each have their own character and during times like these they are tested. It is where the shitcoins are separated from the altcoins.When the altcoins started to bounce, it became really interesting. 1: I started to notice that my overall balance didn't really improve because I was holding too many coins, and different position sizes. Some bounced, others not so much.2: The test coins I bought after my initial investment came back into the green first. In the meantime I updated my spreadsheet to expose price divergence using my BTC and USD purchase prices as a baseline, and lo and behold, they did diverge, and quite significantly. At some point I had trades which ended up in 30% profit in USD, while still being in the red when measured in BTC.Side note: You could argue that I got my money back, and in a way that is true, but I want my BTC value back, because that is what I originally bought.With the confirmation that HODLing losses was indeed working against me, I acted right away, re-balanced my portfolio, and consolidated most of my losses. If I have multiple altcoins with losses within a range from 10-30%, why not consolidate them in 1 altcoin which has much more potential and could gain 30%, right?In the meantime, I was tracking an asset for a couple of weeks already which caught my attention before it suddenly got hyped and took off. I took the profits from my test coins first and used the proceeds to buy this new asset, and as the price increased, I started to pull the trades of the worst performing assets/losses one by one, and moved what remained into this new asset using the pyramid strategy.Within an hour my portflio improved quite significantly.Not only did my new selection make profit, I protected myself from further losses on assets which continued to drop after I pulled them.In hindsight I could have done a lot of things much better. For one: If I would have bought Bitcoin and didn't do anything at all, I would be in a much better position, but I had lessons to learn, and I feel pretty good about the fact that I took action right away when I understood what needed to be done. I took my losses, profits, and I re-balanced my portfolio. I am especially happy now that some of the altcoins I owned, became Dogecoins today, like Sia. lol (There is actually a very interesting story to Sia, which should serve as an example for other projects. Long story short: They mismanaged their project beyond believe.)Next step is start shifting to a BTC dominant portfolio.Funny thing: After about half a day later I saw divergences creep back in on my new trades and while this is line with expectations, I was a bit surprised how quickly that happened. It puts another emphasis on why HODLing altcoins only works under specific circumstances, especially now that BTC is rocketing/killing the altmarket.When the BTC king rises, the altcoins bend their knees. Re-balancing: Old portfolio, after the fork: Assets: Antshares, Bitcoin Core, Burst, DigiByte, Golem, NEM, Nexus, Pivx, Siacoin, Stratis, Verge Status: USD -30% loss; BTC remained unchanged at -50% New portfolio, after re-balancing: Assets: Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Cash, NEM, Nexus, Safe Exchange, Stratis, Status, Syscoin Status: USD -10%; BTC -40%I am well on my way to get back my investment in USD, but still have a long way to go to get my BTC back. My portfolio is now a lot closer to what I want it to be, I have become a lot more knowledgeable since I bought my first shitcoins, I have settled on a strategy and set of indicators, I found the right sources to follow/learn from and know who to ignore, and overall I think I am much better positioned right now to earn it all back, and go beyond.While there is still lots to learn, I think I passed though the learning curve, and settling down.My portfolio and trades aside, I have been paper trading over the past weeks as well, to test my indicators and entree/exit points, and this is looking very promising. I haven't felt this confident since I started this project. Other items worth noting: • There was a point where I wanted to get rid of my 150 Stratis, and I found that I couldn't. There were buy orders but the first page didn't even amount to what I was trying to dump, unless I would sell them really cheap. This puts another emphasis on how important it is to sell in strength. In Forex you can buy/sell at any time because of the volume but in this market, it is easy to get stuck. Which brings me to the following bullet:• Every time when a top or bottom is reached a distribution or accumulation phase takes place. Meaning, those with lots of capital will sell all the way to the top to the noobs, and when it tanks the accumulation phase begins by buying from the noobs who are selling it at losses. In order to get rid of lots of capital, they have to sell in strength otherwise there is no one to sell it too, and vice versa. It is important to follow these phases because even with very little capital, in this market you could find yourself looking for buy/sell orders where there aren't any.• I performed a number of back-tests on trading view to test indicators. Of course, none are profitable by themselves, but it does give you a very good idea on the accuracy of an indicator, in this market, under historic conditions. The RSI came out as a clear winner. • I have a script which is used for pump and dumps, which I want to utilize for different purposes. I have more testing and tweaking to do on a demo account, but the idea is that you can perform actions using a script through API on Bittrex, at a very high speed. I am particularly interested in the ability to dump assets quickly, because of the following bullet:• Call me crazy but I think the market is in for a crash, this year, and will be followed by a multi-month bear market. The market will continue to expand and prices will grow in the long term, but I really think that the increases we are seeing today are unsustainable and pure FOMO. On Telegram, I see so many people asking how to buy NEO, without knowing anything about anything. \"Guide me to buying NEO, please!\"It's scary. Red flags everywhere!People are selling their souls to get into BTC and NEO.I really think BTC will crash, maybe once it has bumped into $4800. It might kill the altmarket in the process.As such, I have set up my account with Vaultoro, and the moment I think I need to bail, I want to use my script to dump all altcoins, and send all BTC to Vautoro to buy Gold until the storm passes.Having said that: My portfolio is not there yet. Gettng closer to it, but I have a few altcoins I still need to get rid of. Some other notes (to be incorporated in the posts below):This is Project Bitcoin, and not Project Shitcoin, so making a few changes to my strategy. Strategy: • HODL BTC• Only trade altcoins in up-trends (when price above 50 EMA, and outpacing BTC)• HODL altcoins only when you get in early and expect a rally in the very short term, and use a stop loss/take profit order to lock in your investment Indicators (always on)Candle sticks (W, D, 4H)20 and 50 period EMAStock RSI Indicators (when additional information is required)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:50:47.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f571b9931d939a39fa648fed4c1b04f26cff534", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.UVA2wR_akKxnKy0GekKy5Qzulop34v2BWFZjN6aT9i3SmF29GXPEu1ODZMx3yg1coHyRccIoZOA6KbWYHO0aEjDsrNHm6rk30XEZbO9HhenSCKCIVbpreuqbmZP8rie.N9kIRfKXL595Wl.CwY4Q3", "site_full": "www.guatemalatoday.net", "site": "guatemalatoday.net", "site_section": "http://www.guatemalatoday.net/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Guatemala Today", "title": "BitCoin payment Is Available :: Best Place To Purchase 20 mg Cymbalta :: Safe Drugstore To Buy Generics", "title_full": "BitCoin payment Is Available :: Best Place To Purchase 20 mg Cymbalta :: Safe Drugstore To Buy Generics", "published": "2018-06-01T02:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f571b9931d939a39fa648fed4c1b04f26cff534", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.UVA2wR_akKxnKy0GekKy5Qzulop34v2BWFZjN6aT9i3SmF29GXPEu1ODZMx3yg1coHyRccIoZOA6KbWYHO0aEjDsrNHm6rk30XEZbO9HhenSCKCIVbpreuqbmZP8rie.N9kIRfKXL595Wl.CwY4Q3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "inguat", "published": "2018-06-01T02:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "BitCoin payment Is Available :: Best Place To Purchase 20 mg Cymbalta :: Safe Drugstore To Buy Generics", "text": "Best Place To Purchase 20 mg Cymbalta Generic Cymbalta Safe Buy Generic Cymbalta Drug.

If you want to buy altcoins, you will have to go through a somewhat drawn-out process in order to convert your fiat currency into bitcoin or ether on the likes of Coinbase and then transfer these coins to the respective exchange upon which you want to buy the altcoins .\nBittrex is an exchange based out of Seattle and they have more than 200 digital tokens that can be traded on their platform. On May 31, they announced that they have come to an agreement with a bank so they can now allow some of their customers to trade using US dollars. BTCManager first reported on this development on February 1, 2018, when the plan to add fiat support was first announced.\nBill Shihara, CEO of the Bittrex Exchange, stated to Bloomberg :\n“It’s been a long path. It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.” USD Trading Available to Corporate Clients For Now\nStarting off, it appears this will only be available for corporate clients in certain states and only for cryptos bitcoin , tether and trueUSD. Advertisement advertisement\nThe opening up of fiat deposits will make the process of getting involved in cryptocurrency investment plays a whole lot easier for these parties, which is only a good thing for the markets and for Bittrex. They will be able to attract more users and subsequently earn more in commission from those people who are using their exchange. Development teams of coins listed on Bittrex can apply for USD support using this form .\nThe bank in question is Signature Bank, which is based in New York and they will be one of the firms who will be safeguarding the dollar funds, and shows that the traditional banking system are becoming more comfortable with trusting cryptocurrency-related businesses. Crypto Exchange’s Frail Relationship with the Banking Sector\nTo date, a lot of large banks and financial institutions have largely avoided the sector due to uncertainty with government regulations and compliance. Many still see the crypto sector as being a haven for criminal activity, which is why the majority of exchanges have to rely on crypto-to-crypto trades rather than dealing with dollar-to-crypto trades.\nThere have been some groups who have come around to this idea, with Coinbase having a relationship with a number of banks in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nAnother significant exchange, Bitfinex, has not been without its troubles in recent times as they had been dropped by Wells Fargo & Co in 2017, which meant that they turned to the UK Noble Bank International for their banking duties. Tether Exposure Subsidies, Somewhat\nThere are also fears that if Tether implodes , exchanges relying on USDT like Bittrex would also lose out and perhaps even go out of business. However, with this new USD offering, Bittrex should be relatively safe in the worst case scenario for Tether.\nCurrently, Bittrex has over three million users worldwide, a number which is certain to grow on the back of this announcement. They also have the biggest offering of digital currencies globally.

For context, the person who hacked HBO last year wanted around $6.5 million worth of bitcoin.\n“Your Security Down im Not Sorry.”\nWe reached out to Ticketfly in an attempt to confirm IShAkDz’s claim that they contacted the company, but a spokesperson declined to address that point. The company did provide us with a statement, however.\n“We realize the gravity of this decision, but the security of client and customer data is our top priority. We are working tirelessly, and in coordination with leading third party forensic experts, to get our clients back up and running.”\nA partial list of file folders provided to us by the hacker.\nImage: screenshot/mashable\nThe hacker, meanwhile, sent us a link to a directory containing thousands of CSV files that appear to contain Ticketfly customer and employee data such as names, emails, addresses, and phone numbers. Motherboard was able to confirm that at least some of the data is authentic.\nThe database we received did not include credit card numbers.\nAnd IShAkDz says he’s not done yet. On the site sent to Mashable, IShAkDz threatened to release additional information.\n“Your Security Down im Not Sorry,” reads the page. “Next time I will publish database ‘backstage.'”\nNot sorry.\nIShAkDz did not respond to a follow up request asking him to detail the contents of the “backstage” database.\nIn the meantime, the Ticketfly website remains offline.\n“Following a series of recent issues with Ticketfly properties, we’ve determined that Ticketfly has been the target of a cyber incident,” reads a statement plastered to the company’s only loading webpage . “Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue. We are working to bring our systems back online as soon as possible.”\nIt is not immediately clear how this hack is affecting venues that rely on Ticketfly’s services, though at least one San Francisco spot, 1015 Folsom , listed on a cached Ticketfly page as using the company’s services, is presently selling tickets through a working Eventbrite portal.\nAnd while that’s great news for 1015 Folsom, it doesn’t address the looming concern that IShAkDz isn’t done dumping data yet.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gadgetrio.us/category/tech-news/", "https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0nXUT5WNJaEJ:https://www.ticketfly.com/venues-promoters/+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us", "https://gadgetrio.us/ticketfly-hacker-demands-bitcoin-ransom/#respond", "https://gadgetrio.us/author/admin/", "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbk3nx/ticketfly-website-database-hacked-data-breach", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "http://1015.com/", "https://www.ticketfly.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mashable", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T02:37:09.097+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d537c6a54a5d75fdd8ba5cd88d25c6156202bd2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR_5y84V46Hljox9aUmprP0O60QQC3jF3ix0Ba9WUofBPjCWot_dIghMpuYAf4pVC__JboqzvX8F6", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Four BIG Reasons For Bitcoin Bull Run", "title_full": "Four BIG Reasons For Bitcoin Bull Run : btc", "published": "2018-06-01T02:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.207, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d537c6a54a5d75fdd8ba5cd88d25c6156202bd2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR_5y84V46Hljox9aUmprP0O60QQC3jF3ix0Ba9WUofBPjCWot_dIghMpuYAf4pVC__JboqzvX8F6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VidrihMarko", "published": "2018-06-01T02:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Four BIG Reasons For Bitcoin Bull Run", "text": "submitted by /u/VidrihMarko\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/@VidrihMarko/four-big-reason-for-bitcoin-bull-run-5144f5a4fd21"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T22:56:54.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8845f061d46e075eaffa31dcb14774c2f367cf33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCLmOKip_eNqrAehyqRKSUfx06ll.JQ5AoMPMltM5_IwN5jjn9zpyqWpFk.n23CICpx8c8fm6Z_O96w1ZSX.41DEiAO1BImaoEaf5Wyc9CY_I-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "title_full": "Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "published": "2018-06-01T02:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527800885_46229116.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8845f061d46e075eaffa31dcb14774c2f367cf33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCLmOKip_eNqrAehyqRKSUfx06ll.JQ5AoMPMltM5_IwN5jjn9zpyqWpFk.n23CICpx8c8fm6Z_O96w1ZSX.41DEiAO1BImaoEaf5Wyc9CY_I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T02:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "text": "1 minute ago Bitcoin Technology Bitcoin Magazine 0 Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex Inc. has established a formal agreement with Signature Bank in New York to allow corporate clients in specific states to purchase virtual tokens using USD. The move is designed to increase the amount of institutional capital making its way through the crypto space. Chief executive officer of Bittrex Bill Shihara says the exchange has been working on this partnership for months. “It’s been a long path,” he commented. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex; it’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general, and I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.” Due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding virtual currencies, many established financial institutions continue to associate them with money laundering and related criminal activity, and have chosen to avoid them altogether. Last February, for example, customers who tried to purchase digital currency through Citigroup were treated to serious delays and cancelled transactions after the investment firm made the decision to bar users from buying crypto using their debit cards or checking accounts. This decision was later replicated by establishments like Chase and Bank of America, both of which implemented bans preventing customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies on major exchanges. Thus, many virtual currency marketplaces still only allow customers to trade between digital assets, rather than dollar for crypto or vice versa. However, some banks are beginning to show signs of change in both attitude and business protocol, and have become more welcoming of cryptocurrencies. Popular digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently developed partnerships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the United States. The company has even garnered a Barclays PLC bank account in the United Kingdom . Noble Bank International in San Juan, Puerto Rico, also took over banking duties for Bitfinex in 2017 after the exchange’s relationship with Wells Fargo came to a sudden end. Discussing the needs of traditional banks, Shihara went on to say, “They really do look and pour through the entire business. They want to make sure we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes and that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.” Bittrex, which boasts roughly 3 million customers around the world, allows users to trade up to 200 different digital coins. Fiat trading capabilities will also be launched May 31, 2018, for bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. At press time, the service is only available to corporate clients in New York, California, Washington and Montana, though executives say they are working to expand this capability to retail investors once regulations are more defined.

A Big Forking Problem Nobody can accurately see 100 years into the future, but prominent economist Rober Shiller claims Bitcoin may go the way of the West African Black Rhinoceros — that is to say: extinct. According to the Yale professor, hard forks will be to blame for the dissolution of the first and foremost cryptocurrency. Shiller told CNBC’s Trading Nation : Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today [in 100 years]. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not. Indeed, the amount of Bitcoin hard forks already in existence numbers above 30, and most notably includes the likes of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Bitcoin Private (BTCP). A whole slew of less noteworthy forks also exists, including irrelevant coins like Bitcoin God (GOD), Bitcoin All (BTA), and Bitcoin Smart (BCS). Meanwhile, more hard forks of the market leader are already planned, including Anonymous Bitcoin (ANON). One may easily argue that the sheer amount of Bitcoin hard forks indeed does very little to benefit the most mainstream cryptocurrency. In fact, there remains a civil war of sorts between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) — the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization — with the latter actively making attempts to claim the Bitcoin name for itself while rebranding the former to Bitcoin Core. Adding to the confusion is the fact that a group of developers has recently embraced the Bitcoin Core moniker perpetuated by some Bitcoin Cash proponents — having launched a cryptocurrency under the same name (BTCC) while calling it the real open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash. For those who have yet to dip their toes in Bitcoin’s waters, the widespread co-opting of the market leader’s name can be overwhelming — particularly when trying to figure out which is the “real” Bitcoin. ‘It Looks like a Bubble’ Hard forks may not be the only reason Bitcoin dies in a century or so. Shiller also claimed that the gold-standard of cryptocurrency could fade away into obscurity as times change. He explained: The one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away. The prominent economist also added that Bitcoin “looks like a bubble,” but still noted that nothing is certain, stating: It’s so hard to predict these things. Predicting Bitcoin’s future is made even harder by the fact that the market leader itself is a voluntary monetary network, meaning every user chooses to play by the rules of consensus. The bigger the network gets, the harder it becomes to change said rules. Furthermore, Bitcoin will only tighten with future soft forks, offsetting the loosening of rules caused by controversial and irrelevant hard forks. Where do you think Bitcoin will be in 100 years?

Both organizations are seeking to develop a stronger, more organized system for allowing charities to accept virtual currency donations. BitGive previously made headlines in October 2017 when it launched its new GiveTrack platform, which uses blockchain technology to clarify and record digital asset donations to global charities. Individuals can trace their funds in real time, and see how their money is spent once an organization receives it. They are also informed of the charity’s project results, creating direct engagement between the donor and the receiver. BitGive’s founder Connie Gallippi explained in a statement: “It’s been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped shape the development of our platform and define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionize the charitable sector.” BitGive and the University of Edinburgh are seeking to uncover the challenges of using and converting cryptocurrencies in third-world countries. To do this, BitGive will analyze data collected from GiveTrack’s implementations in nations like Indonesia, Kenya and India to better understand these regions’ levels of cryptocurrency acceptance and feasibility. In addition, both organizations are also hoping collected data will shed light on merchant adoption, regulation, and the effects of cryptocurrencies on local governments and cultures in each country. Research partner at the University of Edinburgh Dr. Claudia Pagliari says: “Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through our research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can ultimately influence the success of these approaches so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programs worldwide.” Open Mind Africa This week, BitGive also launched its latest charitable project partnership with Open Mind Africa , aiming to raise funds to support a Summer Camp and Educator Summit in Ghana, where students will have “fantastic opportunities to develop essential social-emotional skills, multiple intelligences, build friendships and make memories that will last a lifetime.” Now in its second year, the camp is also inviting educators and facilitators from the U.S. and Australia, as well as Ghana. Open Mind Africa was founded on a firm belief that there is a better future for Africa if we promote a quality education rooted in essential skills needed to succeed in school, career and life. Past projects that BitGive has successfully funded and supported in the past include the Maternal & Neonatal India Program , the Chandolo Primary School Water Project and the Shisango Girls School .

Initially available only to corporate clients in Washington, California, New York, and Montana, the first USD trading pairs will be Bitcoin, Tether, and TrueUSD. Shihara told Bloomberg : It’s been a long path. […] It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance. The best alternative to having your own banking license. So far only for corporate accounts… Bittrex gets bank agreement to help you buy Bitcoin with dollars https://t.co/rgoNhH2a2D via @markets — Christian Kühl (@chrkuhl) May 31, 2018 Big Banks Lose Out The move is equally conspicuous on the part of Signature. That the bank is based in New York, a jurisdiction infamous for its BitLicense scheme, is not without a touch of irony. The broad-reaching and overly invasive initiative has caused a number of cryptocurrency businesses to leave the state, while others have stopped serving New York residents altogether. With several major US lenders – including Wells Fargo, which previously provided banking support for Bittrex – banning customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies with their bank-issued credit cards, smaller banks like Signature are stepping in to fill the void. Speaking about the agreement, Shihara commented: They really do look and pore through the entire business. […] They want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. While Bittrex can now resume US dollar trading, other exchanges are struggling to gain banking support. The one exception seems to be Coinbase. The largest of the US exchanges, Coinbase continues to expand its suite of willing banking partners. In fact, they recently reached an agreement with UK lender Barclays to increase the ease with which UK users can buy and sell cryptocurrency for GBP.

A ledger, if you will.\nIt was also BITCOIN, the coin, the currency, the actual token being moved across the bitcoin network.\nThis was well known, and in fact you could even get by being considered clever by talking about it; plenty of old videos of people speaking , experts, etc\nNowadays the bitcoin term has almost completely been replaced by \"blockchain\" - most likely due to rise of alts, etc. The fundamental technology behind alts is bitcoin though, not \"blockchain.\"\nFor anyone to confuse this deliberately (cough) and make it out like the term \"bitcoin\" is a singular definition is acting in bad faith.\nThis community is being made out to seem like we claim to be BITCOIN, that \"bitcoin\" only refers to one thing - that we are all basically sitting around saying:\n\"Your $7,000 BTC is ours. We are the real BTC and our BCH is a tool we are using to absorb the value of your BTC.\"\nThat's completely wrong, BCH is a competing economy entirely.\nIt not only makes us seem like bad actors by a simple blurred definition, it confuses how cryptos gain value as wild market speculation vs separate economies (like nation-states)\nOf course certain ideas concerning crypto having value only as a result of people trading fiat for it would benefit from obscuring this distinction as well. The idea that BCH can \"absorb\" BTC as a result seems like a real \"threat\" given this way of looking at the market.\nIn short; BCH doesn't claim to be BITCOIN, it claims to be bitcoin, the original peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology.\n submitted by /u/5400123\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T22:57:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "936d493773a2a79dfa6beb0309b5afb3e2243e43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRwYYylXexYYTecW18dr27gMXWWT7zrJRipGvWpE3dhPCgUfLkvsQS4POVXlWsrpGwIVDFLu7koKspPs3OXhsw9k-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bittrex Gets Bank Agreement to Help You Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "title_full": "Bittrex Gets Bank Agreement to Help You Buy Bitcoin With Dollars : btc", "published": "2018-06-01T02:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.418, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "936d493773a2a79dfa6beb0309b5afb3e2243e43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRwYYylXexYYTecW18dr27gMXWWT7zrJRipGvWpE3dhPCgUfLkvsQS4POVXlWsrpGwIVDFLu7koKspPs3OXhsw9k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "riqelme", "published": "2018-06-01T02:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bittrex Gets Bank Agreement to Help You Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "text": "submitted by /u/riqelme\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-31/bittrex-gets-bank-agreement-to-help-you-buy-bitcoin-with-dollars"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T22:56:39.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec8e5885f230c57d0114134b3d8c1a48c8fb45d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrkmn3BWxK6c5_8zXC7GB08H4KXH8R6klRsQVSQLxDlYuC5k0rRVgh3XGgOsebXBgU-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6837", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "CNBC.com News", "title": "Buy bitcoin now while it's still cheap, says cryptocurrency hedge-fund owner", "title_full": "Buy bitcoin now while it's still cheap, says cryptocurrency hedge-fund owner", "published": "2018-06-01T02:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec8e5885f230c57d0114134b3d8c1a48c8fb45d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrkmn3BWxK6c5_8zXC7GB08H4KXH8R6klRsQVSQLxDlYuC5k0rRVgh3XGgOsebXBgU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T02:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy bitcoin now while it's still cheap, says cryptocurrency hedge-fund owner", "text": "May 31, 2018 at 19:03 PM EDT Buy bitcoin now while it's still cheap, says cryptocurrency hedge-fund owner Buy bitcoin now while it's near bottom and still cheap, says cryptocurrency hedge-fund owner.

So now is a good time to buy.\n\"All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now,\" said Morehead, who serves as CEO and co-chief investment officer of Pantera.\nAs a whole, cryptocurrencies have declined about 65 percent from their highs this year, he said.\n\"It's much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,\" Morehead said Thursday on \" Fast Money. \"\nBitcoin , one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, reached highs of $19,500 last December, only to dip below $6,000 in February . On Thursday evening at 5:30 p.m. ET, bitcoin was priced around $7,500.\nThe volatile nature of all cryptocurrencies has left market watchers on edge amid looming regulatory concerns. Cryptocurrency is still a largely unregulated industry .\nBut this might work in investors' favor, Morehead said.\n\"Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact,\" he said. \"Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we're hearing about come online, they'll already have their positions.\"\nHis tip for investors: Buy a currency once it breaks its 230-day moving average, wait a year and sell.\n\"Without even thinking about it,\" Morehead said, \"you make an average of 239 percent.\"\nThe trader said this strategy is best illustrated in bitcoin, a coin in which it \"happened about five times in the last six years,\" he said.\n\"That's the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average,\" Morehead said. \"So today is a good day to be buying.\"\nPantera Capital Management, which Morehead founded in 2013, is one of the first U.S. bitcoin firms. The company owns about 35 pre-auction ICOs and about 25 liquid blockchain currencies, including XRP, ethereum and bitcoin.

ransom It’s down. 2018-05-31 22:52:22 UTC\nAs far as blackmail goes, it was a relatively small request.\nThe hacker who claims to have gained access to a host of data from Ticketfly, prompting the Eventbrite-owned ticketing company to pull its site offline sometime late last night, told Mashable that he was only after a single bitcoin.\n“[Yes] i asked them 1 bitcoin for protection,” explained the hacker, who goes by IShAkDz, over email, in addition to sharing a huge repository of allegedly stolen files. “But I did not receive a reply from them.”\nAt the time of this writing, that comes out to around $7,500. For context, the person who hacked HBO last year wanted around $6.5 million worth of bitcoin.\n“Your Security Down im Not Sorry.”\nWe reached out to Ticketfly in an attempt to confirm IShAkDz’s claim that they contacted the company, but a spokesperson declined to address that point. The company did provide us with a statement, however.\n“We realize the gravity of this decision, but the security of client and customer data is our top priority. We are working tirelessly, and in coordination with leading third party forensic experts, to get our clients back up and running.”\nA partial list of file folders provided to us by the hacker.\nImage: screenshot/mashable\nThe hacker, meanwhile, sent us a link to a directory containing thousands of CSV files that appear to contain Ticketfly customer and employee data such as names, emails, addresses, and phone numbers. Motherboard was able to confirm that at least some of the data is authentic.\nThe database we received did not include credit card numbers.\nAnd IShAkDz says he’s not done yet. On the site sent to Mashable, IShAkDz threatened to release additional information.\n“Your Security Down im Not Sorry,” reads the page. “Next time I will publish database ‘backstage.'”\nNot sorry.\nImage: SCREENSHOT/ISHAKDZ\nIShAkDz did not respond to a follow up request asking him to detail the contents of the “backstage” database.\nIn the meantime, the Ticketfly website remains offline.\n“Following a series of recent issues with Ticketfly properties, we’ve determined that Ticketfly has been the target of a cyber incident,” reads a statement plastered to the company’s only loading webpage . “Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue. We are working to bring our systems back online as soon as possible.”\nIt is not immediately clear how this hack is affecting venues that rely on Ticketfly’s services, though at least one San Francisco spot, 1015 Folsom , listed on a cached Ticketfly page as using the company’s services, is presently selling tickets through a working Eventbrite portal.\nAnd while that’s great news for 1015 Folsom, it doesn’t address the looming concern that IShAkDz isn’t done dumping data yet.\n!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod? n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n; n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version=’2.0′;n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0; t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,’script’,’https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js’);", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbk3nx/ticketfly-website-database-hacked-data-breach", "https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0nXUT5WNJaEJ:https://www.ticketfly.com/venues-promoters/+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us", "http://1015.com/", "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js’);", "https://mashable.com/2017/08/08/hbo-hack-cybersecurity-ransom/", "https://www.ticketfly.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mashable", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T02:35:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "571d5fcd284195810bdd21c5248d76144d1869e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme2Ox4LYpHDrZLD7JVXdgcM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How can i start Bitcoin Mining ?", "title_full": "How can i start Bitcoin Mining ?", "published": "2018-06-01T01:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "571d5fcd284195810bdd21c5248d76144d1869e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme2Ox4LYpHDrZLD7JVXdgcM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Liternyy", "published": "2018-06-01T01:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "How can i start Bitcoin Mining ?", "text": "Cloud clearing or its own farm?

Crypto merchants have known as this sample the Bart, though in conventional marks it is called the “diamond reversal”. This value motion is unnatural, as it’s unlikely that this rise in demand happens unbiased of bullish information occasions and shifting day averages, thereby elevating questions as as to whether excessive frequency merchants are using momentum ignition algorithms. Momentum Ignition Algorithms Momentum Ignition Algorithms perform by inflicting a pointy spike both purchase or promote motion, thereby attractive merchants to comply with swimsuit. Following this development, extra merchants will place purchase orders above vital zones anticipating a development reversal, and brief sellers will place stops losses in comparable areas, these are successfully purchase orders. To ensure that the algorithm to be handiest it has to push value into these liquidity zones, triggering buys, and from there it might probably disengage. The impact on market individuals The merchants who jumped in on the tail finish of the ignition have been considerably deprived as the worth rapidly dropped as soon as the unique “igniter” dropped out. The buildup methods, usually engaged on behalf of fund teams, have paid a deprived value. Algos have been inappropriately tricked into buying and selling, which impacts the market making purchase and promote aspect corporations. In sum, the unique igniter almost certainly acquired out of their place for a revenue on the expense of those that had been tricked into participation. The result’s the Bart, a pump or a dump, adopted by a return to the imply quickly after. Actors utilizing this manipulation tactic profit by having their promote/purchase orders crammed, and inflicting the market to open positions in opposition to the development. Within the instance beneath you’ll see how value motion fell beneath an space of great resistance, painted a standard bear flag. As soon as patrons had been exhausted, and sellers grew to become keen, value motion fell out of the bear flag and commenced dump. At this second the algorithm is activated and intense shopping for motion occurs. These with shorts open rush to shut them, creating purchase orders, and the pump commences.

Providing Professional ICO Support\nTermed InWage, the new advisory initiative will tap into traditional firms that need assistance with holding and developing token sales, as stated on a press release on May 29, 2018. The platform shall feature customer knowledge plans, payment processing modules, in-built KYC procedures, and a customized front page. Additionally, Inwage shall provide end-to-end development of smart contracts. Sponsored Links\nFurthermore, the firm shall introduce smart contract security audits for existing cryptocurrency firms, in addition to certifying website safety. Other than technical support, InWage shall also provide marketing and public relation activities for clients.\nJonathan Chester, the founder and president of Bitwage, informed that the idea of creating this platform was sparked by the queries and advice he was asked for, by individuals and firms alike in the ICO domain concerning its technical and marketing features.\nChester added that the vision is to eliminate third parties involved in the ICO process by creating a technological framework that serves as a one-stop solution:\n“This is actually one of beautiful things about ICOs, the ability to sell a digital asset without the requirement of a third party.” InWage Client Mora Raises $50 Million\nInWage was already shown results for its ICO advisory service, as the company’s first client, Moria, reportedly raised $50 million.\nLaunched as a decentralized funding platform dealing in precious metal extraction, Moria is backed by Ethmint and the GS Mining Company – which runs a gold mine in Colorado, U.S.\nA success story in its own, Moria had initially planned at raising about $30 million through an ICO, but ended up surpassing their expectations by raising a whopping $50 million, he added.\nChester concluded by saying that InWage now aims at collaborating with service providers dealing in regulatory compliances and investor channels, to make ICOs available to firms of all sizes. Bitwage Introduces ETH Payroll System\nBitwage also launched its ether (ETH) payroll system on May 29, primarily to allow cryptocurrency firms to pay their workers with the digital currency.\nBitwage stated:\n“ ICOs raise funds in Ethereum but are unable to obtain bank accounts to pay their workers. As a result, employees are often unable to receive their wages in local currencies. In order to help companies pay workers around the world in the currency of their choice, we have decided to launch ether Inputs.”\nAragon and Status are reportedly using the service since January 2018, after Bitwage rolled it out for a soft launch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan chester", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin payroll service bitwage ico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin payroll service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitwage", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T01:41:08.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe4876aaa1dbbad11e4193bdc2d3edfc35b3dc2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcSpA2TF.B4vw2TzdtIc0Dw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin value", "title_full": "Bitcoin value", "published": "2018-06-01T01:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.978, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe4876aaa1dbbad11e4193bdc2d3edfc35b3dc2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcSpA2TF.B4vw2TzdtIc0Dw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chopmoney", "published": "2018-06-01T01:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin value", "text": "Bitcoin is now the most reliable option for storing funds in the crypto currency, which explains why investors and enterprising people are eager to make money on changes in the exchange rate of this currency, which also ensures its growth at the moment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:16:16.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9180b98c62a7a9bc9f4d2e70464f9b0b1211a54d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSLrCYVtxO5bYtkn0Sw04wGhymhsvYaM8H1_lijPx8DWeTpViHpcfYA98SyfeExcbmdodUzilPj_UCh1BcVjz.eNkm.VTxkVSaqUq6pahsGITSOKdrRzSEgEXDLEHqv8KI", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Infographics", "title": "Bitcoin Infographic (first time using Illustrator)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Infographic (first time using Illustrator) : Infographics", "published": "2018-06-01T01:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9180b98c62a7a9bc9f4d2e70464f9b0b1211a54d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSLrCYVtxO5bYtkn0Sw04wGhymhsvYaM8H1_lijPx8DWeTpViHpcfYA98SyfeExcbmdodUzilPj_UCh1BcVjz.eNkm.VTxkVSaqUq6pahsGITSOKdrRzSEgEXDLEHqv8KI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CorerMaximus", "published": "2018-06-01T01:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Infographic (first time using Illustrator)", "text": "submitted by /u/CorerMaximus\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T13:11:35.059+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 24308, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=7900", "requestsLeft": 583}
